Participant:
Well, yeah.
Because I don't keep it clean.
You know, and I keep believing that if I could just get it cleaned up, I would keep it clean.
And I started with the closet, and the closet was working out great, and, you know, I had the clothes, and they were all hung up, and they were in a particular order for, you know, working on whatever.
The dresses were here, and the pants were here, and the shirts were here, and the sweaters were here.
And I, you know, I did that about— gosh, it’s been about two years, but now I have to go back in and redo it all.
At some point, I stopped.
It's not immediate, but at some point I stopped.
And I can't pinpoint when it was, but I just stopped doing it every single time.
I wouldn't hang it up, I’d start and I’d lay it over the trunk, and then the next day I lay something else over the trunk, and then I would go and I would clean it all up, and then I’d start again, and I laid over the trunk.
And, gosh, I mean, I just think that I'm lazy.
I just honestly think that I'm lazy, and it drives me crazy.
Like honestly, I don't want to be this way.
Interviewer : Right.
So, have you ever tried to change it?
Like have you ever gone to a professional?
Like a counselor or a therapist for that.
Participant:
No, no. I mean no, I haven't.
Um, I first have to admit that it's a problem.
Interviewer : Right.
Which it sounds like you do acknowledge that it is a problem.
Participant:
I do acknowledge that it is a problem, but I don't know that I'm willing to acknowledge it in a more public way.
Interviewer : Right.
Okay so, how do your friends and family feel about your behavior?
Have you ever had any sort of conflict with them about it?
Participant:
Just my husband.
Interviewer : Okay.
Can you tell me a little bit about that?
