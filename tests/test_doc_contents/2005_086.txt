Interviewee: NAME  uh want to go ahead?
P1: Okay.
Interviewee: the next one?
P1: Yeah, so um another questions we wanted to ask related to this was do you think that cultural forces that are present in our society today that associate value and self-worth with consumption and material positions, do you think that those forces play any role in the development of hoarding disorder?
P3: Hm I personally think so, yeah I do think so, yeah the ‘cause ‘cause the society seems to give a lot of reinforcement um on the capacity of buying and what profess- what items can mean to someone status someone identity and someone’s tastes, you have good things then you are a tasteful and elegant person, and yeah a lot of it seems that uh this is such a consumer based society, and a lot of things are telling you to buy and all the holidays are all about buying, so yeah I think that society plays a big role in this, not that is causes hoarding disorder but it definitely encourage it.
Interviewee: Um, so we have I think like maybe one or two more questions, um I we’re going to try to keep it confined to the next five minutes but I want to be respectful of your time so if you need to cut us off as we wrap this up, please just let us know, okay?
P3: Okay.
Interviewee: Okay, for the next questions are kind of focused on INAUDIBLE  kind of practically and how patients with low insight get to treatment, so if you could, please describe um what you think the typically process that occurs for patients to get to your office is like.
