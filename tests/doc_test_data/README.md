# Test Document Contents, Cleaned

This directory is here for ease of testing functions that do a lot of work in deleting content from files. It contains different versions of the
original file contents in each file, separated by speaker and cleaned up to a certain degree.

I am not committing these files to the repository for now, due to privacy. In the meantime, if you need to access them, ask me for a copy.
