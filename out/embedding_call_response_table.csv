001,001_000.txt,1,0.5943054556846619,all right. so could you please describe your clutter problems? how long has this been going on?,"oh my gosh. a long time. i mean, i get lots and lots of mail. i try and go through it and throw things away. i'd say over 20 years."

001,001_000.txt,1,0.43801194429397583,and do you think this behavior is a problem?,"well, yeah. kind of. because that's why i'm participating in the study because i'd like to get tips on how to stop doing this. you ever heard of somebody called the flylady?"
001,001_000.txt,1,0.2467111349105835,i have not.,oh you haven't? she's a person that deals with clutter. people... yeah. the flylady. and there's a website. and people go to her. and it's basically based on little steps type of thing where you make little steps. people who have been depressed for a long period of time. people who have gone through a death. people who have gone through bad times in their life that that's the last thing they want to do is clean their house and clean up the clutter. so-
001,001_000.txt,1,0.5361177325248718,yeah. okay. have you ever sought to change this behavior?,yes.
001,001_000.txt,1,0.5731890201568604,have you gone to a professional or CROSSTALK-,no.
001,001_000.txt,1,0.9024831652641296,no. okay.,no.
001,001_000.txt,1,0.3273373544216156,okay. and all right. perfect. thank you. that's good. how do your friends and family feel about your behavior?,"they don't know about it because i don't have them over. i mean, my husband and our house, he deals with it. he just deals with it. but my house is kind of unfinished because i have clutter all over the place because i go between two different places where i'm never in the same place long enough. i don't live in one spot. i live in a couple of spots."
001,001_001.txt,1,0.5346746444702148,yeah. okay. all right. perfect. thank you. okay. so could you please describe where you live now? what's the space like?,"well, my space is very small. it's a room with a bathroom and i share a house with ... well, i don't share a house. i just have a room with a bathroom and i have my little refrigerator in the bathroom. i have no place to cook. and so when i buy groceries i have to buy mostly takeout when i'm down here but this is my place in the city so that i can work, but now with covid it's become crazy because the libraries are closed. this is just a place for me to sleep. it's got all my work clothes. it's got all the stuff i need for work. stuff to get ready for work. it's got a tv in my keurig and all my stuff. and stuff i use all the time. then at my house up in the foothills has my long-term stuff and my furniture and everything else. and it's all my cooking and it's a full home, so i go back and forth between the two."
001,001_001.txt,1,0.3633955419063568,yeah. i know. it's definitely horrible.,i had this specifically as a place to sleep when i go to work in the bay area.
001,001_001.txt,1,0.5948944091796875,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. yeah. okay. thank you very much. let's see. are there parts of your home that you consider cluttered in your view and what makes them cluttered?,"my living room. my table. my dining room table is full of stuff. and the stuff ... when i get up there, i open my computer and i lay out my mail and there's mail and there's stuff on the floor. and i get through stuff and then i cook and i put everything away. it's not like i just leave ... i'm not one of these really cluttered people where you can't walk around. so not like that. i'm not like that. but i do have piles that i'm concerned about because i just don't do anything with that."
001,001_001.txt,1,0.8923182487487793,yeah. okay.,so yeah.
001,001_001.txt,1,0.7426599264144897,"yeah. let me see here. okay. when do you think about ... oh, sorry. i'm lost. when you think about your possessions, there we go, what makes them valuable?",oh what makes them valuable?
001,001_001.txt,1,0.3379596471786499,yeah. mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"the fact that i'm going to use them again. i mean, there's some left-in valuable memories, memories that are attached to them. and sometimes clothes that i can't wear anymore, i won't give them away just because they've got memories attached to them. or i think maybe someday i'm going to wear them. but i have two full closets full of clothes. i've given some stuff away. i give stuff away all the time to goodwill, but i still have tons of stuff. i have more stuff that i could ever use."
001,001_002.txt,1,0.6530166268348694,okay. yeah. yeah. and so what do you think is trash for you? what would you discard?,"i clean my bird cage every day and discard the papers under the cage. i throw away bottles after i use them. we recycle things down here, so i get rid of stuff all the time. everyday i throw out bottles that i use. newspaper. but i usually recycle the newspaper and use it. food and discarded food. and then i throw things away after they're just beat up. i throw away purses. i throw away clothes when they're worn out. and a lot of times i'm given things as gifts that i hold onto out of probably more ... what's the word i want to use? i feel bad because i don't like them, but i hold onto them, you know?"
001,001_002.txt,1,0.2688007354736328,yeah. uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.,"but i shouldn't do that. i should just get rid of them. i wish i was a better ... just go through and just say, ""i haven't worn this anymore. get rid of it."" but i mean there are things that i've made. i took tailoring and i made coats that i know i'll never wear them again but i worked on my ass off on them, right? so they're still in my closet. so things that i've worked really hard on that mean something even though i don't wear them, they're there to bring a memory to me about something because as i get older, my memory is bad and sometimes i need tangible objects. i'm more of a spacial person."
001,001_003.txt,1,0.30660703778266907,"okay. okay. all right. thank you. so next question is, what do you think the most precious item in your house is?","oh god. my bird. my live bird. i mean, my precious ... because all the fires we've had here in the bay area. i've watched people and they left their pets behind. i freaked out. it's like, how can you leave your pets?"
001,001_003.txt,1,0.2668641209602356,yeah. i know.,"probably because they were at work or something and they told them to evacuate and couldn't get back. but my pets and then pictures, i guess photographs, i'd probably grab a box of photographs of my mom and dad who are dead and something like that. that's all i can think of. i mean, i have insurance so all of this stuff can be replaced."
001,001_003.txt,1,0.48697108030319214,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. okay. thank you. do you think you have too much stuff?,yes.
001,001_003.txt,1,0.46470388770103455,"okay. let me see here. okay. if you had to choose between any of your items, we kind of talked about this, how would you choose a certain item over the other one?","well, whether i used it or not."
001,001_003.txt,1,0.32687699794769287,yeah.,"whether i used it or whether i intended to use it which is why i've got so much stuff it's just like well, i can use that. but see, i lost my job. this has nothing to do, but i lost my job through this covid thing and i'm trying to find another job and the last thing i want to do right now is clean. now other people, they're baking, they're doing gardening. no. i'm kind of more focused on finding a job. once i know i've got a job, i can relax and the rest of my life fall into place. but i've had some difficult times as i've gotten older and it depresses me. when i'm depressed, that's the last thing i want to do is clean. there's no way."
001,001_003.txt,1,0.3907875120639801,i understand. yeah. mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. all right. let me see here. does your behavior upset you in any way? do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?,"yeah. i mean, when it gets in the way ... i mean, when it gets in the way i clean it up. and i have it situated so that it isn't in my way. but for instance i'll give you an example. i take the new yorker. okay, that's a weekly magazine. there is absolutely no way you can get through it in a week. and it piles up and piles up and everybody who takes the new yorker knows that. if the subscription is just and i'm sitting here, i haven't even read half of them. they're all over place. and it's like i've done this before and it's like i don't read them but i really want to read them because it's the best read stuff. so that's something that i've got all over my house. new yorkers, everywhere."
001,001_004.txt,1,0.5817781090736389,so the next question is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?,"no. i mean, maybe ... you know what upsets me is when i lose something. i cannot stand it when i lose something and even the most little thing. if i lose it, i freak out and i don't know what that's about either. it's like they're just a material thing. but it's almost like i feel like i'm losing my mind and it drives me nuts. it just drives me nuts. and it just gives me comfort to know it's there whether i use it or not. it's weird. it's just a weirdness that i have. that's part of my clutter problem."
001,001_004.txt,1,0.48929089307785034,yeah. okay. perfect. let me think here. what do you think the most important difference is between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?,"well, hoarding disorder is when you let the papers pile up to the point where there's just stuff that you really just don't need. but you still want to go through it. it's like at some point it's collecting dust and it's just crazy. like i'm looking in my room right now which is just nuts. and so i think when the piles start getting pretty high ... and this caused problems in one of my relationships. my old boyfriend who walked into the kitchen, i had piles up all over. he just took his arm and went boom. and just knocked them over."
001,001_004.txt,1,0.4471672773361206,"oh, wow.",i've had enough. i have had enough of this. it has caused problems in my relationships. yes.
001,001_004.txt,1,0.4412041902542114,okay. thank you. okay. where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?,"i don't really. i mean, i've seen people who are ... i mean, i've watched these shows on tv. those people make me want to gag. i don't think i'm like that. i'm not like that. but i do know i have an issue with ... having a clean house and an orderly house. that's not me. that's not me, and i don't care. if i were having a party, and i used to have lots of parties, then i'd clean up and stuff. but i don't have parties and i go home and i like my alone time and i'm not really entertaining that much right now. and i guess entertaining would be some reason for me to clean up but otherwise, i don't care. i just don't care. i mean, i care enough to be a part of this study, but maybe i need to know why i don't care."
001,001_004.txt,1,0.6889667510986328,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. okay. yeah. perfect. thank you.,"are these helpful or you just say, ""perfect, thank you""? CROSSTALK."
001,001_004.txt,1,0.5287341475486755,"oh, no. yeah. these are very, very helpful. absolutely. it's great. absolutely.",okay. okay.
001,001_005.txt,1,0.46334975957870483,"yeah. thank you. so for the next part of the interview, i'm going to be reading you stories and i'm going to ask you questions and you just answer the questions to the best of your ability, okay?",okay.
001,001_005.txt,1,0.3228522539138794,"okay. so for the first story, john doe has several boxes that he likes to keep in case he needs to store something or decides to move. when items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. he is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms. his house is not always organized but not usually cluttered. occasionally it's different for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. when this happens, he's rarely late in getting where he needs to be. okay. so the person depicted in the story, in your opinion, do you think they have hoarding disorder or is their behavior like a clutter problem?",no. no. neither. neither.
001,001_005.txt,1,0.2733849883079529,okay. so why would you say that?,"because they put them in the closet. keeps them out of sight. i sometimes, but i've been religiously breaking down boxes and putting them in the trash. and because i used to ... and i do keep several boxes in my garage that i think i'm going to use for christmas presents and those are sitting out in the garage. but no. i don't think he has a hoarding disorder. no. not clutter. no."
001,001_005.txt,1,0.3653855621814728,"yeah. okay. and is this behavior similar or different to that of your own, in your opinion?","i don't store boxes in a closet and i don't have that many and i do throw them away. and i have a designated spot for my keys, but i've been in problems where i've lost my ... oh god, it drives me nuts. i can't find my keys anywhere. but that is not an issue of hoarding. that's an issue of memory. it's not hoarding. it's memory. and that's my memory is getting ... because i'm 66. so my memory is starting to go and not fun."
001,001_005.txt,1,0.6061338186264038,yeah. i'm sorry.,it's not fun.
001,001_006.txt,1,0.5073404908180237,"yeah. okay. so the next story, i'm going to read you another story. here we go. john doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. when the items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in. he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. stacks of boxes occupy every room. before entering his bathroom he must remove several stacks of boxes. his house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for him to walk in his house. often, it's difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. he is almost always late in getting where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all. so in your opinion does this person have ...","no. yes, he's a clutter. he's a terrible clutter and that's not me."
001,001_006.txt,1,0.4190901517868042,clutter. okay.,"that's not me. i have papers in every room, but i would never have papers so i couldn't get out the door i couldn't ... that's ridiculous. and like things that i have... i have a computer that's old and i want to throw it away but i need to get it right. and it's sitting in my office. it needs to be gotten rid of and i want to get rid of it. it's just i haven't because i don't know where to take it. sometimes when those things come up, i'm not in the right place at the right time, so those kind of things. but no. i'm not like that. and i'm always usually early or on time, i think. so ..."
001,001_006.txt,1,0.5001826286315918,perfect. okay. and do you think this person should try to change their behavior?,yeah.
001,001_006.txt,1,0.3628585636615753,okay. and why do you say that?,"yes. because he can't get through his house. there's something wrong. my aunt had a neighbor like that and i gave her this gift and she gave it to her neighbor, because her neighbor coveted it, but you go to her neighbor's house and she can barely make a path through the house and their neighbor didn't really ... i got mad she gave it away because this neighbor just wanted it to put in her piles of crap."
001,001_006.txt,1,0.3479229509830475,of course. yeah.,"people that can't get into their house and stuff like that, there's something wrong. yeah."
001,001_006.txt,1,0.39780133962631226,yeah. definitely. okay. perfect. so okay. i have another story for you. okay. john doe has clothes that he likes to keep in case he needs to use them in the future. clothes occupy most of his room except for the kitchen and his bedroom.,oh my god.
001,001_007.txt,1,0.2983894944190979,"before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. at the same time, it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. when this happens, he's usually late in getting to where he needs to be. so in your opinion, does this person have hoarding disorder-",yes.
001,001_007.txt,1,0.7332161664962769,... or clutter problems?,clutter.
001,001_007.txt,1,0.6714330315589905,clutter. okay.,not hoarding.
001,001_007.txt,1,0.47571468353271484,not hoarding.,"well, maybe a bit of both because he's saving clothes for if he needs them, and i do that."
001,001_007.txt,1,0.26831862330436707,okay. uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.,"i mean, i have seven patagonia jackets because i love patagonia jackets. do i wear them all? no. i don't wear them all. they sit in there and i try to rotate them. but i have a closet. i have two closets. i have one here and one up there and i periodically get rid of stuff. what my problem is, there's pairs of jeans on the floor that need to be patched and i need to embroider the patches and that takes a long time and i haven't had the time, so the stuff sits on the floor. that kind of thing. that kind of thing. but, no. i'm not late because i can't find things and get out of the house. i mean, no."
001,001_007.txt,1,0.46158522367477417,of course. okay.,i try not to be late for anything. that's a pet peeve of mine.
001,001_007.txt,1,0.4719466269016266,"that's great. okay. let's see ... oh, here. should this person try to change their behavior in your opinion?",yes.
001,001_007.txt,1,0.8014256954193115,okay.,yes.
001,001_007.txt,1,0.3881702125072479,and does the behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist in your opinion?,yeah.
001,001_007.txt,1,0.3724380135536194,okay. and could you tell me why or ...,"because he's always late and that's not good. i mean, that's an indication ... that's a problem with ... that creates a ... god, i can't give you the words i want to use."
001,001_007.txt,1,0.4469442665576935,"yeah. like a life disturbance, maybe?","well, it's opinions that people make about you based on your behavior and if you're late all the time, you're going to be looked on as a flake."
001,001_007.txt,1,0.5363931655883789,"yeah. okay. yeah. perfect. okay. so yeah. like a life disturbance type of thing, is CROSSTALK.","a life disturbing, yeah. because if he's applying for jobs or he's going to an interview or he has to be at work on time and you're late all the time, you're going to get fired. so when it causes life changing decisions, then you got a real problem. like drinking. like drinking."
001,001_008.txt,1,0.36404022574424744,"yeah. exactly. okay. okay. so last story for you. john doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and he knows they're valuable. so he goes out once a week and buys more antiques. he's worried that he might get rid of an antique that is worth a lot of money. antiques occupy every room. before entering his bathroom he must remove several antique items. often, it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he's looking for. he is almost always late in getting where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all. so in your opinion, do you think this person have-",yes.
001,001_008.txt,1,0.6416327953338623,yeah. clutter problems again?,yeah.
001,001_008.txt,1,0.2634114921092987,okay.,"yeah. well, clutter. yeah. clutter. because it's ridiculous. he has so many antiques that they impede his behavior and cause problems in his life."
001,001_008.txt,1,0.5703370571136475,yeah. mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. is this behavior similar or different to that of your own in your opinion?,different.
001,001_008.txt,1,0.3502148389816284,and why would you say that?,"because i'm not late to my meetings and i mean it's the same in that i collect clothes like that. i may collect ... but they're in my closet. and i put my keys in one spot. i mean, that's why i do it. because i have a spot so i don't lose them. and there's just certain things you got to be careful of and they're major things. the keys are major to get you out of the house and get you out the door."
001,001_008.txt,1,0.8531767129898071,yeah. of course.,so yeah.
001,001_008.txt,1,0.3376978933811188,okay. perfect. thank you.,"i mean, you would think that one episode of 30 minutes trying to find keys would cure that problem. the person would be like, i got a problem."
001,001_008.txt,1,0.6426252126693726,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. you would definitely think so. yeah.,yeah.
001,001_008.txt,1,0.5551409721374512,"okay. perfect. so that's the end of the stories. so we're going to go ... this last part of the interview is about covid-19 and again, i'll just be asking you questions again. so again, any clarification please feel free to ask me. if you're uncomfortable answering any of the questions, just let me know. absolutely no problem.",okay.
001,001_009.txt,1,0.49166905879974365,okay. all right. so first question is how has covid-19 impacted your life? what specific behaviors has changed?,"going into work. i can't go in and see other people. when i go out and run, if i'm not wearing a mask, people start cowering and yelling at me. it's ridiculous. i'm out on a trail six feet away from somebody. they're ... but you know, in all fairness, it hasn't changed my life that much because once i was working from home quite a bit before and i did lose my job last january, and partly due to covid because they closed our san francisco office because the company was having money problems anyway, but they closed the san francisco office and everybody is working remotely for good, which i think is really bad. it's really bad. i think it's alienating people and people are having problems-"
001,001_009.txt,1,0.29314014315605164,i agree.,"... and eating more than normal. when i'm up by my house where i can cook, and that's not good. i've had some health problems because i don't know why. i'm having some right now. i just got back from the doctor. so it's caused health problems. and we have had horrible fires in the bay area. and so the smoke travel here has been horrible for the last couple weeks."
001,001_009.txt,1,0.583858847618103,absolutely.,this is like the year from hell.
001,001_009.txt,1,0.5323883891105652,i know.,the year from hell.
001,001_009.txt,1,0.6006879210472107,it's horrible.,i know.
001,001_009.txt,1,0.5333166718482971,absolutely horrible.,i know.

002,002_017.txt,1,0.3449862003326416,"would you say expensive items are more of a priority in that sense, or is it just time?","yeah, i mean because i use my ipad and my laptop every day, my phone. i've been moving from hard copy books to kindle books because of my hands. its just easier to hold a kindle than it is to hold onto books, it's a problem to hold books all the time. a lot of my movies are now digital copies."
002,002_017.txt,1,0.44127357006073,does your behavior upset you in any way?,"yeah, i mean, i try to avoid looking at the floor. because i don't care for the disorganization, but i also don't care enough to do anything about it."
002,002_017.txt,1,0.5162979364395142,"okay, so would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?","yeah, i mean, i wouldn't want to have to like the idea of it doesn't feel too... if i had to rent a storage unit and if i couldn't afford it, that would upset me. i got real lucky when i had to move in and my parents had a little portion of the garage to fit all my stuff, even though they can't stand it."
002,002_017.txt,1,0.620557427406311,"yeah, okay, so we're going to move onto the next section here. what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?","hoarding is when you can't get rid of things, so not only do you collect, but you have a time a hard time letting go. to the point that your house and living areas become a mess, and you don't have much of a social life, or you can't have people over because your place, there isn't much room, or things like that. when i had my own little apartment, i wasn't able to have people over too often because it was real crowded with stuff."
002,002_018.txt,1,0.6051502823829651,what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?,"well, i mean, the first thing that comes to mind is situations like the show hoarders, where it's the extreme. then i had people on my dad's side, his siblings, some of them were real hoarders, and that on more of the extreme side, they'd have sheds and sheds of stuff. it was a mess and when a couple of them passed away. we had to just sort through some stuff. but i also have understood, just from my own personal living experiences, that it's not always that extreme. you can go through life having... to where it still affects your social life, and your mental well-being, just because you have trouble getting rid of things. you collect things, but you're not... from head to toe, every inch of your house is covered, but it still affects you and your house is still a mess."
002,002_018.txt,1,0.4312618672847748,"okay, thank you. for the next section, i'm going to be reading you stories, and i'm going to ask you specific questions afterward, okay?",mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
002,002_018.txt,1,0.7993163466453552,"first one, john doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something, or decides to move. when the items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in, he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms. his house is not always organized, but not usually cluttered. occasionally, it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend a couple of minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them, when this happens he's rarely late in getting where he needs to be. okay, so does the person depicted in this story have hoarding disorder, or is it more like clutter problems in your opinion?","i wouldn't say so much hoarding. i mean, he does have some clutter issues, i've been known to do similar things with keeping boxes in case i need them later, or having trouble locating keys, and things like that. but the way you described it, it's more like he's just keeping boxes and his place is a little messy."
002,002_018.txt,1,0.4401886463165283,do you think this person should try to change their behavior?,"i mean, he could maybe organize his things a little better maybe, and not worry about the boxes as much. i've learned from own experience that when you move you can go to home depot and get boxes."
002,002_019.txt,1,0.6471884250640869,"okay, so the next story is somewhat similar. i'm going to read it, okay? john doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. when items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container that the item came in, he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. stacks of boxes occupy every room. before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stack of boxes. his house is extremely cluttered. it is difficult for him to walk in his house. often it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. he's always late in getting where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. does the person depicted in this story have hoarding disorder or is it more like clutter problems, in your opinion?",it's a hoarding problem.
002,002_019.txt,1,0.46037396788597107,"okay, and do you think this person should try to change their behavior?",yes.
002,002_019.txt,1,0.389923095703125,can you tell me why in your opinion?,"because its affecting social life, getting to places on time, and also him getting distracted, or like you mentioned he forgot what he was doing."
002,002_019.txt,1,0.5892773866653442,"is this behavior similar or different to that of your own, in your opinion?",probably different.
002,002_019.txt,1,0.29416221380233765,can you tell me why in your opinion.,"because i don't have to move things out of the way to get to my- well that's not... just because of the way my... where i currently live, because i live with my parents, my mom is a neat freak and ocd in that way, so my situation's more of a clutter problem. but when i lived by myself, it was half and half clutter hoarding, so i would have to move things. not to exactly the extent you described but when i was in the kitchen, i'd always have to move things. i did have a small kitchen though, but i didn't have a dishwasher, and i had small... everything was just this small situation, but my kitchen looked like it was all... everything stacked up and a mess. my bathroom was fine but my bedroom and our living were in that situation."
002,002_020.txt,1,0.6334309577941895,"okay, thank you for that, so the next story is a little different now. john doe has clothes that he keeps in case he needs to use in the future. clothes occupy most of his room, except for the kitchen and his bedroom. before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. sometimes it's difficulty for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventuality finds them. when this happens, he's usually late in getting where he needs to be. for this one, do you think this person has hoarding disorder or is it more like clutter problems?","i still think it's on the hoarding side. it's just more specific to a certain type of item, it's the specific to clothes."
002,002_020.txt,1,0.49625688791275024,"yeah, do you think this person should try to change their behavior, in your opinion?","yeah, i mean, you can find ways that he could probably still collect or keep clothes but not to that extreme. get organized better, so maybe just change a little and not having to change from one extreme to the other."
002,002_020.txt,1,0.5313942432403564,does this behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist?,"not necessarily, i've seen people on shows like konmari, or whatever, where she's gone into homes and changed people's lives. there's a lot of people that can help others that have been through it. but psychiatrists, they make a big a difference, it just depends on the person, i think."
002,002_020.txt,1,0.3853990137577057,"yeah, of course. is this behavior similar or different to that of your own?","i mean, i do collect a lot of clothes, but i've had a lot weight shifting ups and downs, but i tend to keep it all in the bedroom. i mean, i do keep it all in the bedroom, whether it's a combination of the closet and the floor, that's about it. like i described earlier, from the basket to the laundry bag, and then the closet, and on hangers in the closet. but the stuff that i use the most is the ones i wash and then put in the basket, and then put in the... but i still have other clothes in the dresser, and other clothes in the closet. probably not to the same extent, but a little bit lesser."
002,002_021.txt,1,0.669967532157898,"all right, perfect, thank you. okay, so this is the last story that i'm going to read you. okay, so john doe has several antiques that he likes to keep, because he likes them and he knows that they are valuable. he goes out once a week and buys more antiques. he's worried that he might get rid of an antique that's worth a lot of money. antiques occupy every room, before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. often it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he's looking for. he's almost always late getting where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. in this case, do you think this person has clutter problems or is their behavior more like hoarding disorder?","it's still going to be more of hoarding if he has to move things. well, when i hear things like, ""he can't the find keys,"" i think of a clutter thing, and if you have to move things around a little bit. if it's to the point where you have a whole lot and you can't... if it's moving or spilling over into the bathroom, i start to think hoarding, because that's functional, unless you've got a whole bunch of shelves in your bathroom or something. similar where my kitchen was, i never had things spilled into the bathroom, but i certainly did it with my kitchen. my kitchen table's full of non-kitchen items. just random stuff from the house, stuff i was collecting, or just stuff that i didn't want to put anywhere else, because i didn't know where to put it or just procrastinating of getting organized, or whatever. i didn't have much counter space, so every time i cooked i had to move everything, so i guess i'd call it hoarding."
002,002_021.txt,1,0.39015671610832214,do you think this person should try to change their behavior then?,"yeah, just so they can be functional and on time for things."
002,002_021.txt,1,0.5328261256217957,did you really think that treatment would come from a psychiatrist?,"it could be beneficial. i think with things like that, you could get help from either a psychiatrist, or you could first start with a life coach, or just somebody that's going to take on a similar role, like when you're trying to start a diet or exercise program."
002,002_021.txt,1,0.46612197160720825,"yeah, like a support, for sure.","a support person, but if its something you're really struggling with then you probably need to see a doctor or a psychiatrist. see if its something you might need more help with."
002,002_021.txt,1,0.42343011498451233,"yeah, for sure, and do you think this behavior is similar or different from that of your own?","like what i was describing, it could be similar because like i was saying, i had stuff that would spill over into my kitchen and living room. but i did have a really small apartment, but that doesn't mean if i had a bigger apartment it would get any better. but, thank goodness i didn't have a bigger apartment, because i know INAUDIBLE. but yeah, i'd say it could describe me."
002,002_022.txt,1,0.5441146492958069,"yeah, okay. perfect, thank you, so that ends the story portion. this last part is about covid-19, and so i'm going to be asking you questions again. please let me know if you need clarification or are uncomfortable answering any of the questions, okay?",okay.
002,002_022.txt,1,0.49340736865997314,how has covid-19 impacted your life?,"i went out of work when it started, because the schools closed and i was teaching at the time. i was a substitute teacher, so i had a long-term assignment but i wasn't a permanent teacher. i didn't get rehired when they reopened it, because the remote teaching stuff, so i was out of a job for four months. i gained 20 pounds because i was really depressed, stuck at home, and ended up... i would buy a bunch of stuff just because sometimes when i get stressed out, that's what i'll do. i'd eat a lot of junk food, and stuff like that. i finally got a job in july, so my stress levels went down a bit, but i still had some depression. when i'm not working i just seem to just be sleeping a lot."
002,002_022.txt,1,0.6318324208259583,"okay, do you think that covid-19 has affected difficulties throwing away things? has it made it worse to throw away things?","well, i haven't really gone out. i mean, the stuff i do get i shop online for, but i don't know because i haven't really had things that i've gotten, whatever, things that i need to throw away. but when i do get new things, i have hard time throwing away the boxes they come in, because i think that, ""maybe what if i have to return this? i'm going to need the box to ship it back in."" things like that. it's hard to answer that question."
002,002_022.txt,1,0.372781902551651,"yeah, of course. do you think that now that you're home all time, do you have time to organize or is that something that's not CROSSTALK?","i should, but i haven't. i feel like i'm tired all the time and i lack energy. when i was doing the teaching, i seemed to be more physically active, and now i seem to just... i think part of it's the depression, i'm less physically active because i'm working from home, and so my body's a lot weaker. like i said, i gained 20 pounds since it started, and i've been more anxious, and a little more depressed."
002,002_023.txt,1,0.6605428457260132,"yeah, okay, so how have you been coping, would you say? has there been specific techniques that you've found helpful?","i haven't been using been too many good coping methods, i've used, what people would consider... what the right word is, inappropriate? eating, binging on tv shows, things that aren't the most beneficial health wise, or mental health wise. i do read a lot, but i haven't been exercising or doing a whole lot of things that are good for my health or mental health."
002,002_023.txt,1,0.44250988960266113,"yeah, where do you think you seek comfort from? is it from others, your items, something else?","i used to get together with friends once or twice a month, but i haven't been able to do that. right now i have my dog that i get comfort from her, from reading, but i'm in a lot pain so i am... that's harder, and when i'm less active the pain's worse. when i'm focusing on other things, i don't have as much time to think about the pain that i'm in. i find that when i'm working and engaged in stuff, my pain is... i have bulging discs and fibromyalgia so that pain is definitely real, it's not all in my head. but i can distract myself from my pain by doing things and stuff, but when i'm not doing things, i can't distract myself from it."
002,002_023.txt,1,0.4491596817970276,"yeah, it's definitely tough to do.","i'm sorry, i got distracted, CROSSTALK."
002,002_023.txt,1,0.43918105959892273,"no, don't worry about it. okay, i can just go back to the questions. were you involved in treatment for your clutter problems prior to covid-19?",no.
002,002_023.txt,1,0.5732579231262207,"okay, have the people living with you changed during covid-19 at all?","i mean, so i have siblings that are a whole generation younger, because we adopted them and they're home from school. now they're doing school from home, and they're social life is different because they don't get to do stuff with friends as much. a lot of us are driving each other crazy, and arguments more. i've been keeping to myself in my room. it isn't a whole lot different, when i lived by myself, that's what i did. just being around the family, when we're stuck together for months at a time, we drive each other nuts. i try to just keep my distance right now."

003,003_027.txt,1,0.42087864875793457,is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?,"asking them INAUDIBLE, no, i guess not."
003,003_027.txt,1,0.4645802080631256,okay. i do know you mentioned the show hoarders. so where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?,"i'm not even sure i've ever seen INAUDIBLE i saw a bit, and it's a good tv show, INAUDIBLE."
003,003_027.txt,1,0.5237261652946472,nice. so what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?,"just these images of people kind of INAUDIBLE with stuff piled up, INAUDIBLE stuff around as much as they can, INAUDIBLE and otherwise it's just stuff piled up."
003,003_027.txt,1,0.5666785836219788,"okay. so for the next part, i will now read some vignettes and ask you some questions after each one.",okay.
003,003_027.txt,1,0.5238369107246399,"his house is not always organized, but it usually is not cluttered. occasionally it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. when this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be. so do you think the person depicted could have hoarding disorder, or is their behavior more like clutter problems, and why?","i guess more INAUDIBLE if they're keeping that extra stuff, i guess he's got the space so it's not a INAUDIBLE or the space the guy lives in is really small, INAUDIBLE not to get rid of the box INAUDIBLE maybe he's not going to INAUDIBLE."
003,003_027.txt,1,0.5712278485298157,so do you think this person should try to change their behavior?,"no, not necessarily. if it's bothering him."
003,003_027.txt,1,0.4657110571861267,okay. is this behavior similar or different to your own?,"it's different. he has the space to INAUDIBLE whereas stuff is kind of INAUDIBLE, some of it INAUDIBLE these extra clothes or-"
003,003_028.txt,1,0.6521124243736267,"often it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. he is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. so do you think this person has hoarding disorder, or his behavior is more like clutter problems?",that sounds more like hoarding disorder.
003,003_028.txt,1,0.4724494218826294,why do you think this?,just because the fact that it's having INAUDIBLE he can't find stuff INAUDIBLE.
003,003_028.txt,1,0.4044720530509949,so do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?,"probably, yeah. INAUDIBLE if it's not INAUDIBLE."
003,003_028.txt,1,0.3789759874343872,okay. and how is this behavior similar or different to your own?,"INAUDIBLE definitely not, INAUDIBLE floor space to walk around, INAUDIBLE."
003,003_028.txt,1,0.7822958827018738,"so again, do you think this behavior is more like hoarding disorder or more like clutter problems and why?",it sounds like hoarding. INAUDIBLE hoarding disorder.
003,003_028.txt,1,0.4010932445526123,okay. so do you think this person requires treatment for his behavior from a psychiatrist?,very likely.
003,003_028.txt,1,0.5902497172355652,"then is this behavior similar or different to your own, and why?",INAUDIBLE it's probably similar INAUDIBLE.
003,003_029.txt,1,0.4604390859603882,"so again, does this person's behavior seem more like hoarding disorder, or is it more like clutter problems, and why?",that definitely INAUDIBLE it doesn't sound INAUDIBLE so it's probably disordered.
003,003_029.txt,1,0.46058768033981323,okay. should this person try to change their behavior?,INAUDIBLE probably.
003,003_029.txt,1,0.4489949643611908,okay. and does this behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist?,probably.
003,003_029.txt,1,0.5238606333732605,"okay. and is this behavior similar or different to your own, and why?",it sounds different. INAUDIBLE.
003,003_029.txt,1,0.5407219529151917,"okay, so the last part of this interview is about covid-19. again, i'll be asking you questions, please let me know if you need any clarification or are uncomfortable answering any of the questions.",sure.

003,003_029.txt,1,0.5134556293487549,yeah. and how has it affected problems with clutter?,it's really about the same. INAUDIBLE too many boxes to INAUDIBLE.

003,003_030.txt,1,0.44291049242019653,"okay. where do you seek comfort? do you seek it from others, your items or somewhere else?","i'm not sure, INAUDIBLE."
003,003_030.txt,1,0.5030808448791504,"okay. have you sought treatment, resources or some kind of professional support during covid-19?",just occasional visits with my physician.

005,005_032.txt,1,0.4857437312602997,"okay. to begin, as you know, this study is investigating individual attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. the first question is what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?",clutter.
005,005_032.txt,1,0.5263059735298157,"okay. yeah. sounds great. thank you. once again, thank you for creating those lists. the next part of this interviewer is more of a conversation. i will ask you some questions for you to answer and feel free to ask questions if you need clarification. if any question makes you uncomfortable just let me know and you don't need to answer that question.",okay.
005,005_032.txt,1,0.754157543182373,"okay. first, can you please describe your clutter and how long has this been going on?","describe my clutter? things ... is it best with an example? like mail that has stacked up, that i haven't yet gotten to."
005,005_032.txt,1,0.5330756902694702,yeah or how severe would you say this behavior is?,moderate.
005,005_032.txt,1,0.5525691509246826,moderate? okay. do you think that this behavior has been a problem for you or for your family?,"it has definitely been an issue for at least i would say 30 years, maybe not as severe as it is now."
005,005_032.txt,1,0.5741467475891113,have you ever sought to change this behavior or have you ever gone to a professional or anything?,"i have never sought treatment. honestly, i think i am just now starting to see it as a problem or as something that might be able to be fixed. you know, i think in the past it was just i was messy. now it's clearly more than that."
005,005_032.txt,1,0.5844578146934509,okay. have you ever had any conflicts with the people around you such as a landlord or family?,not a landlord but definitely with my daughter at times.
005,005_032.txt,1,0.355106920003891,okay.,"she's living at home again and there's certain things that have not moved out of certain rooms that are on their way somewhere else. you know, it just makes it hard to use that room."
005,005_032.txt,1,0.5428560972213745,yeah. yeah. definitely. can you please describe where you live now? you might have mentioned it. do you live alone? what is the space like in your home?,"i have a home, kind of one and a half stories, that i've only lived here for three years and my daughter moved back home a year ago. it's got three bedrooms and the downstairs is kind of a play room."
005,005_033.txt,1,0.6571418642997742,okay. are there areas of your home that you would consider cluttered? what makes them cluttered?,"yes. my office is cluttered because of papers and too much stuff. it kind of looks organized sometimes because i've got things in boxes and labeled boxes. you know, it would just be great if i didn't have them and i don't really think i need them all. my dining room, my prior house i had a whole different style of house so i have my dining room is filled with all of the old furniture that i need to sell still as well as my dining room furniture that i have now and that's true in several rooms."
005,005_033.txt,1,0.5959248542785645,okay.,yeah. that's probably the best description.
005,005_033.txt,1,0.6783723831176758,are there parts of your home that you don't use or are they all inaccessible?,"my garage, i can't ... but all the rooms inside the house are accessible."
005,005_033.txt,1,0.5315293669700623,okay. what kind of things do you think your garage is filled with? what's the main thing you think?,boxes of stuff from my old house that have been in storage for two and a half years. i haven't even seen them to know what's in there. but i'm tired of paying storage and we just moved all the boxes into the garage.
005,005_033.txt,1,0.515103816986084,yeah. that makes sense.,we're slowly going through them.
005,005_033.txt,1,0.6981269121170044,"okay. yeah. my next question is when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?","multiple things. i mean, there's some because they're irreplaceable, pieces of art, for instance. some are because of who they used to belong to, my mom, my dad, things that my ... memories, things that my kids have made. photographs are valuable to me. then there's monetary value, jewelry and some artwork is valuable, specifically, because it's financial value."
005,005_033.txt,1,0.46478453278541565,yeah. what would you say is the most precious item in your house?,"photo albums. actually, they're not in my house right now because we had to evacuate. now they're in my office. but my photo albums."
005,005_033.txt,1,0.7382106781005859,"oh, okay. when it comes to throwing something away, what is trash for you? what do you usually discard?",such a general question. i have recently been getting rid of a lot of clothing. what do i discard? stuff that i don't think i will ever need.
005,005_033.txt,1,0.4748077094554901,"okay. if you had to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?","well, that's kind of what we just went through in deciding what to actually INAUDIBLE. those things that i felt ... a photograph wasn't going to be enough and that were truly just irreplaceable. photo albums, for instance. you know, the actual photo albums that aren't digital. some of the artwork and important papers, passports and things."
005,005_033.txt,1,0.7484035491943359,yeah. yeah. that makes sense. does your clutter upset you in any way or do you think it's getting in the way of your daily life?,both. yes. it gets in the way of my daily life.
005,005_034.txt,1,0.7840003967285156,can you describe a time where you believe your clutter got in the way of something you really wanted?,"there have been times i've wanted to have people over and felt like i couldn't because there's too much furniture in my dining room, for instance, or papers in my office. i can't think of anything ... if by the question, you mean is there something i wanted to buy but couldn't because of my clutter?"
005,005_034.txt,1,0.8307374715805054,or just something CROSSTALK.,something i wanted CROSSTALK?
005,005_034.txt,1,0.5052396059036255,yeah. it could be that or anything that got in the way of your life and something you really wanted to do or anything?,"yeah. you know, it feels like a domino effect a lot, that i may want to ... for instance, i want to paint the exterior of the house but before i do that i have to get rid of some of the things that are on the back patio or whatever it is but then to have that, i need to have a place for that to go or i need to have a weekend to be able to do it and so it never gets done and i don't get my house painted."
005,005_034.txt,1,0.5855645537376404,"yes. has your clutter ever impacted your relationships? i know you've probably mentioned this before, either romantic, family, or your work relationships?","i don't think it's affected any relationships at work or romantic relationships but, currently, just with my daughter kind of recognizing it. i think sometimes i see her developing some of those habits but, hopefully, she's learning firsthand how to avoid it. i don't recall any impact it's had on our relationship."
005,005_034.txt,1,0.4874298870563507,"yes. would you be upset if, say, you had to get rid of some of your items? like ones that hold value to you?","no. if i had someone that would help me do that and help me see how ... i think i can let go. it's just when i'm having that conversation with myself, i tend not to let go."
005,005_034.txt,1,0.3451521098613739,yeah. that makes sense. what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder itself?,can you read that question again?
005,005_034.txt,1,0.5646584033966064,yes. what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder itself?,"i'm not sure. i think one of the things might be acquiring things that are completely unnecessary without knowing where you'll use it or how you will use it, where you will put it. that's kind of the acquisition of stuff but you were talking about saving things?"
005,005_034.txt,1,0.2590409219264984,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. yeah. is there CROSSTALK ... keep going. sorry about that.,"saving more ... no, it's okay. saving more ... i would imagine one big difference is that normal saving will never or almost never save more than you could ever possibly need whereas someone with hoarding attributes is just saving everything no matter what. every single out-of-shape container forever as opposed to maybe one in two you might be able to reuse again some day. that's probably what i would think is the biggest."
005,005_035.txt,1,0.4759315848350525,yeah. is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?,i would imagine their car might look similar. i don't know. i would imagine that you might recognize it in some people but not on everyone.
005,005_035.txt,1,0.680233895778656,"yeah. that makes sense. also, what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder? where did you get your information about hoarding disorder?","i think i'm using that phrase generically as opposed to in a critical sense. i'm an attorney and i've been involved in some matters where one of the litigants was, in fact, a hoarder and so i have been inside of homes where it was a true... you know the bathroom had 15 blenders that she bought on sale or the 15 used styrofoam containers from takeout that were kind of clean. that's kind of what comes to mind. when i think of maybe hoarding disorder, that's where my mind goes."
005,005_035.txt,1,0.4293689429759979,"when you did view these homes for your work, did it have any affect on your personal behavior or anything?","at the time, i don't think it did because i don't think i recognized my clutter issues as being a subset of that same issue. that's been fairly recent. no. i think it perhaps even maybe made it easier for me to separate from that because this is a person that goes out and buys six blenders. it's an extreme. you have little pathways through a house filled with newspapers from the ground to the ceiling. that was so extreme that it was easy to kind of characterize that in that way and not put myself into that category."
005,005_035.txt,1,0.5344656705856323,yeah. that makes sense. this is actually the end of this section of the interviewer. thank you again. next i will read some scenarios and then ask you some questions after each one. does that sound good?,okay. yup.
005,005_036.txt,1,0.6512053608894348,"in this scenario, do you think john doe could potentially have hoarding disorder? is this a behavior similar to having clutter problems? why?","i would say the fact that he is saving all sorts of boxes and all sorts of sizes, just in case, and i think you described it as he doesn't want to throw away something that he might need in the future, that signals to me some amount of ... i'm not sure if it's hoarding or clutter. i would say the hoarding mentality, losing your keys and finding ... i don't see that as ... everyone does that. it would just be that whole thought of, ""i can't throw away this box because if i did, if i need it in the future, what would happen."" that's the part that kind of signals to me that, yes, he has a bit of it."
005,005_036.txt,1,0.49738818407058716,yeah. do you think that john doe should change his behavior or seek treatment for anything?,"that's a question so personal for the actual person. it sounds like he needs treatment, intervention but maybe some tools to be able to separate from you can find boxes elsewhere when you need one. you're taking up an entire closet for that one potential need. to help him just get through that would probably benefit him."
005,005_037.txt,1,0.7240006923675537,"similar to the previous scenario, i'm asking you the same question as do you think this person has hoarding disorder or do you think their behavior is more like a clutter problem and why?","this sounds more like a hoarding behavioral issue because now that future need, even if it never comes to fruition, is completely occupying his whole life as opposed to a single closet. it's impacting his ability to function on a day to day basis."
005,005_037.txt,1,0.5229308605194092,do you think for this person should they seek treatment or should they seek some kind of resource to help change their behavior?,i would say yes.
005,005_037.txt,1,0.5138343572616577,okay. would you say that this behavior is similar or different to your own in this scenario or why or why not?,"i don't believe mine is ... i think i have some of those attributes but more along the lines of a closet, even though it's not limited to a single closet. it doesn't impact my ability to function every day."
005,005_037.txt,1,0.5033471584320068,yeah.,it is similar but not nearly as ... john doe's is much more extreme.
005,005_037.txt,1,0.6260748505592346,"same question, do you believe john doe in this scenario has more of a clutter problem or do you think it's more serious?","for these questions, you are, in fact ... if i'm understanding it, you're drawing a distinction between a hoarder and somebody with a clutter problem or someone that's messy?"
005,005_037.txt,1,0.7730618715286255,correct.,is that correct?
005,005_037.txt,1,0.39411646127700806,yes.,okay. i'm not sure what the pieces of paper are but i don't think this is clutter. i think this is a problem. i think this is more of a hoarding issue.
005,005_037.txt,1,0.516467809677124,okay. is there a reason why this one is or is it similar to the previous example for you?,"yes. yeah. it is. it's similar to the previous one. it was something particular that is not just, for instance, your mail becomes INAUDIBLE. it's scattered around the house. this is something he is saving for possible use in the future and that seems more of the mentality of a hoarder."
005,005_038.txt,1,0.6762576699256897,"again, in this scenario, do you believe this is more of a clutter problem or something more serious?",i would say it's more than just clutter again because it's acquiring things that don't necessarily have a purpose in the house and just acquiring so many of them that it's interfering with his daily life. i would say it's more on the hoarding side.
005,005_038.txt,1,0.43573319911956787,"for this scenario, do you believe this behavior is similar or different to your own behavior?","there are some similarities, not at that extreme, and i don't ... there isn't one particular thing that i go out and acquire for a collection of, like, antiques. i will purchase things that are kind of '50s era, even if i don't have a place for display or i have too many things to display. sometimes something gets into my mindset that, ""oh, this would look fabulous in my house"" but there really isn't ... i don't need anything more like that. there are some similarities."
005,005_038.txt,1,0.49115437269210815,"okay. thank you. that was the third part of the interviewer. this last part of the interviewer is actually about covid and its impacts. once again, i will be asking you some questions and if you need any clarification or feel uncomfortable answering a question, just let me know.",okay.
005,005_038.txt,1,0.5327966809272766,okay. how has covid impacted your life? what specific behaviors have changed for you?,"to some extent, i am purging but not enough but i'm starting. that's a good thing. especially since i am in my house so much that i kind of see it. also, the fact that i occupy my office and i have so many things going on in my office at once, to some extent, it's messier than it was pre-covid. it's had a multiple impact on me in different ways."
005,005_039.txt,1,0.5902447700500488,have you found yourself buying more things during covid?,"no. a couple of things, like with new hobbies. if i was doing a lot of baking, i might buy a couple of baking tools. but, in general, no."
005,005_039.txt,1,0.48450353741645813,okay. would you say covid has made you more ... i'm not sure how to phrase it. like more urgent to throw away things CROSSTALK.,more aware.
005,005_039.txt,1,0.582527220249176,more aware? okay.,yeah. more aware of the issues and i'm starting to go through my closet and getting rid of things if i haven't worn them in a long time or they don't look great on.
005,005_039.txt,1,0.5704033970832825,yeah. has covid affected your sense of attachment to your items and the value to your items in any way?,"i think it is starting to cause me to eliminate that from my brain, try not to think about how much did you pay for that? yeah. i think that i have taken much more to the goodwill ... i should say, i have taken more valuable things to a charity organization than i have in the past."
005,005_039.txt,1,0.6682223677635193,"yeah. that makes sense. has covid impacted your overall physical or mental health in any way or just your physical wellbeing, your mental wellbeing?",it has impacted it in a very positive way. i started doing yoga and i have been exercising and walking and i've lost 35 pounds since covid started. it's been a very positive change for me.
005,005_039.txt,1,0.5174492597579956,has covid affected you or your family financially? either negatively or positively.,"no. luckily, it has not."
005,005_039.txt,1,0.6641017198562622,"okay. how have you been coping since covid? i hear you say that you may have got new hobbies or anything but, overall, again how have you been coping since covid?",are you asking what do i do to cope with it? am i coping with it successfully?
005,005_039.txt,1,0.48262253403663635,i guess both. what have you been doing and then has that been successful for you?,"okay. i've been doing yoga daily and trying to meditate. i, from the get go, established a bubble with two other people, another couple in our neighborhood, some friends of mine. my daughter and i and the two of them we kept our households as one and we cooked together a lot and it wasn't just me alone, thank goodness, or it wasn't just me and my daughter. we had this outlet of two other people. we kept a social network going that way, which i think helped tremendously to get through some of those worst times."
005,005_040.txt,1,0.7070208787918091,yeah. have you kept in contact with family and friends during this time? how often do you interact with them usually? either physically or virtually.,"i have a son in new york that we talk to not nearly often enough but probably once a week. we hear from him maybe less now but once every two weeks. i have siblings that i speak to all the time. for a while, with extended family, all over the east coast we used to do a zoom family meeting every couple of weeks, which is great. that kind of stopped. yeah. i'm keeping ... the family stays in close contact."
005,005_040.txt,1,0.7128171324729919,yeah. did you feel socially isolated or lonely prior to covid? have you felt more lonely during covid?,definitely more lonely during covid because i am a fairly social person and i miss getting together with people. i can't believe it's been however many months and i haven't seen the people that i work with every single day. it's just weird to me. there's this whole group of people that you spend so much time with every day and every week and then it just stops. it's so odd.
005,005_040.txt,1,0.5789720416069031,yeah. definitely. have you experienced conflict during covid or less or more conflict during covid?,"i don't think there's more or less. you know, i guess frustration over politics makes my life more conflicted. you know, i did a lot of protesting. no, i don't ... i think it's about the same."
005,005_040.txt,1,0.4588894546031952,"okay. yeah. that's actually the last part of our interviewer. thank you for completing this interviewer with me. before we go, i would like to get some demographic and payment information so we can send you that $30 gift card.",okay.
005,005_040.txt,1,0.40213122963905334,okay. let me ...,i'm part of ... you guys got my name from the other study that i'm doing with the university and so i have a credit card that money gets dumped into whenever i fill out a questionnaire or something. is that different?
005,005_040.txt,1,0.4490736424922943,yeah. i believe it's different. we will be sending you either an electronic or a physical gift card.,okay.

005,005_040.txt,1,0.5472497344017029,"okay. where are you located? you said southern california, right?",yes.
005,005_040.txt,1,0.5379698872566223,okay.,do you need it more specific? do you want the city?
005,005_040.txt,1,0.5495895147323608,no. it'd just be regional so like west of the united states.,okay.
005,005_041.txt,1,0.5996827483177185,yeah. what is your highest level of education?,graduate school.
005,005_041.txt,1,0.6833267211914062,okay. do you prefer a physical or an electronic gift card?,electronic is just fine.
005,005_041.txt,1,0.3882124722003937,"okay. okay. once again, thank you for participating. we sincerely appreciate your help as we try to better understand the knowledge and attitudes towards hoarding disorder. before we go, do you have any questions or anything?",i do not.
005,005_041.txt,1,0.48142218589782715,"okay. thank you for participating. if you ever have any questions, you can email interviewer henderson.",okay.
005,005_041.txt,1,0.5768001079559326,okay. all right.,actually i do have a question. is there more to this or is this it?
005,005_041.txt,1,0.5897352695465088,this is it. this is the interviewer part.,okay.
005,005_041.txt,1,0.3315916657447815,yeah. we're all good.,"this study, will there be ... i know the other one i'm involved in every six or eight or 10 months, sometimes they'll have another task to do. this is simply just a matter of this questionnaire or this conversation?"
005,005_041.txt,1,0.8014256954193115,yes.,okay.
005,005_041.txt,1,0.6595295667648315,yeah.,perfect.

006,006_042.txt,1,0.5856810808181763,"okay. your geographic region? such as northeast, south, west, midwest.",i live in far west.

006,006_042.txt,1,0.6187407374382019,all right.,as far as you can go.
006,006_042.txt,1,0.309874951839447,"okay. as you know, this study's investigating individual's values and beliefs relating to hoarding disorders. first, i want to know what term you prefer when we're talking about difficulty with clutters and difficulty discarding. for example, some people like to address it as hoarding, other people say cluttering, other people say organizational problems. do you have any term that you prefer?",no. i'm all of them.
006,006_042.txt,1,0.6756567358970642,okay.,whatever you like.
006,006_042.txt,1,0.6282464861869812,"okay. so i can use hoarding, and that'll be okay with you?",sure.
006,006_042.txt,1,0.5318624377250671,"okay, and more time for yourself, and fun? yeah. okay. now, that's the first half, congrats, we did it. now, the second half, first is going to be more of an introduction about behavior and treatment seeking. if you can please describe your hoarding and how long it's been going on.","well i'm not sure. i've been thinking about this a lot. i probably had a tendency throughout my life to get things because i lacked so much for so long. but i didn't probably really start until maybe 20 years ago. i would say that i was in my mid 50's, my children moved out, left me completely alone. i was lonely, i was working two jobs and tired, and finally had some disposable income. i would start thrift shopping and grabbing things that i thought would make my life better. that's probably about where it started. it's probably been a good 20 years."
006,006_042.txt,1,0.41022059321403503,"okay, yeah. how severe would you say this behavior is now?","it's better now, because i reached the point where i am tired and want it done. i've been working on disposing of things, but i'm having a great deal of emotional trouble letting go."
006,006_043.txt,1,0.43944215774536133,"yeah, yeah. do you think that your behavior is a problem?","my behavior in keeping it is a problem. i'm not shopping anymore. of course part of this is the pandemic helped, because i'm not running out to thrift shops and garage sales and estate sales. that's kind of helped me stop and really think about it."
006,006_043.txt,1,0.5234858989715576,okay. yeah. have you ever sought to change this behavior? or have you ever gone to a professional for help?,no i haven't.
006,006_043.txt,1,0.5717008113861084,okay. have you ever tried to change it or tried to find help in other places?,"i haven't sought help, other than seeking information on internet, watching the hoarding tv shows to try to realize how other people work through it and try to get myself motivated."
006,006_043.txt,1,0.4226135015487671,yeah. right. how does your family and friends feel about your behavior? have you ever had any conflict with them?,"not really. except that one of my sons, i have two sons. one is much more relaxed about things. but i have one that's very much like my mother, everything has to be neat and tidy in his life, and he works constantly. he can't seem to stop tidying up and cleaning and organizing. so coming to my house is uncomfortable for him. that's my biggest issue."
006,006_043.txt,1,0.6419034004211426,"okay, yeah. all right. that's it for the first section. we can move onto the second one, which is space and living area. please describe where you live now, and do you live alone? what's the space like?","i live alone in a single family home with three bedrooms, two dogs, kind of a little storage porch and garage. anything else?"
006,006_043.txt,1,0.5215137600898743,no. what would you want your home to look like?,"i would want it to be easy to navigate and i would like to, when i go into a room, not see something that i need to take care of. i would just like to, yeah, have everything have a place and be able to just do my normal cleaning without having to move things around."
006,006_043.txt,1,0.5087994933128357,"okay, yeah. then there's parts of your home that you would consider cluttered?",yes.
006,006_044.txt,1,0.5212436318397522,okay. what do you think makes them cluttered? specific items or anything?,"oh my gosh, i kept thinking that i'm retired, i'm going to do this craft and that craft and so forth. after i retired, i took a few classes for things i wanted to do and i started gathering all the equipment, the tools, the accessories that i would need to do all of these crafts. i have piles of jewelry making supplies, sewing supplies and the equipment, stained glass supplies. i mean it just goes on and on. by and large i've lost interest in a lot of those through the years anyway. i really need to move things away. but i keep thinking, i spent money on that and time on that, i really need to keep that in case i want to do it again."
006,006_044.txt,1,0.3976813852787018,"yeah, yeah. then would you say that your things are important for you to feel at home?","i'm sorry, i didn't understand."
006,006_044.txt,1,0.5468243360519409,"how important are your things for you to feel at home? if you didn't have them, would you feel less at home than you would now?",i don't think so. i think i'd feel better.
006,006_044.txt,1,0.4795069396495819,"okay, all right. do you know which ones are the most important to you? i know you said that you lost interest in some of them back in march. but have you found others that are more important to you? and tend to spend more time with?","yeah. i would like to get back to painting, so i'd like to keep those supplies. i would like to continue sewing."
006,006_044.txt,1,0.5108039975166321,"okay. yeah. then are there parts of your home that you don't use? for example, for cooking, you wouldn't be using it for cooking, or you wouldn't be using your bathtub for bathing?",not really.
006,006_044.txt,1,0.44121360778808594,"so you would pretty much use everything, there's no areas of your house that are inaccessible?",no.
006,006_044.txt,1,0.5742517113685608,"okay. all right. when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable? how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?","if it has use for me, either now or possibly in the future. if it would save me money."
006,006_044.txt,1,0.4613572061061859,"no go ahead, sorry.","i was going to say, instead of going out and purchasing again, if i think i might need it, i'd like to hang onto it."
006,006_044.txt,1,0.6268302798271179,"okay, yeah, yeah. what would be trash for you? and would you discard?",INAUDIBLE discarding anything other than normal kitchen scraps and recyclables from the kitchen.
006,006_044.txt,1,0.3497140407562256,"okay, yeah. how do you know when it's time to throw something away?",i really don't. i have a real problem with that.
006,006_044.txt,1,0.5135407447814941,okay. yeah. do you have a most precious item in your house?,"well, photos of my family, i think. and the few things that were left to me from my grandmother, and that's about it really."
006,006_045.txt,1,0.5389395952224731,"yeah, yeah. what do you think would happen if you lost it?",the precious things?
006,006_045.txt,1,0.30316656827926636,"yeah, the photos from your grandmother and of your family.","i would just be bereft, i don't know what i'd do."
006,006_045.txt,1,0.45988285541534424,"all right, yeah. do you think you have too much stuff?",absolutely.
006,006_045.txt,1,0.4482920467853546,yeah. how do you know? how do you decide when you have too much?,"i don't have room for everything. i have piles of craft stuff in my hallway. i'm trying to clean out my sewing room, which is a spare bedroom. i moved all of that out into the hallway and i still have a big mess, and it's taking me months to get through this."
006,006_045.txt,1,0.3658916652202606,yeah.,"i did finally go through, i had a huge stash, i guess you'd say, of books. i'd finally gone through some of that and let some of those things go. but i'm really having difficulty with the craft items in particular."
006,006_045.txt,1,0.5211881995201111,"okay, with the craft items. yeah. what if you had to choose between your items? how would you choose, if you had to throw some of them away?","i guess i would just stick with the things i know that i want to do, let the rest of it go, if i can figure out how to do that."
006,006_045.txt,1,0.471415638923645,"okay, yeah. does your hoarding upset you? do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?",yes.
006,006_045.txt,1,0.6495357155799866,okay. can you describe a time when your hoarding got in the way of something you really wanted?,"i don't really quite know how to answer that. i would like to get up and have the freedom to choose what i'd like to do for the day without thinking, i can't do that until i get this cleaned up, or i need to go through this pile and take it to the thrift shop. every day, my mind is occupied with what i should be doing, rather than what i would like to do. does that makes sense?"
006,006_045.txt,1,0.5753416419029236,"yes. you would say it's more general, rather than one specific instance that you can think of?",yes.
006,006_045.txt,1,0.8163667321205139,okay.,yeah.
006,006_045.txt,1,0.42623016238212585,"all right. i know we talked about how one of your sons, it was really uncomfortable for him to come in. does it upset any of your other loved ones?",not really.
006,006_045.txt,1,0.5101366639137268,"okay. okay, cool. you would like to change your behavior because of your son's discomfort?","partly. mostly, for my discomfort. i'm embarrassed that people see that i don't have control over my life. i want the freedom of mind, i want to be able to get up and enjoy things, rather than looking at more to do. if that makes sense."
006,006_046.txt,1,0.5982413291931152,"yeah, no, of course. you would be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?","i am upset, yes."
006,006_046.txt,1,0.514300525188446,okay. you're upset currently because you can't get rid of them?,yes.
006,006_046.txt,1,0.445107102394104,do you think you would be even more upset if you had to get rid of them?,yes.
006,006_046.txt,1,0.6240960955619812,okay. i see.,it's crazy.
006,006_046.txt,1,0.3282017707824707,yeah. did you want to elaborate a little bit on that? on why you think it's crazy?,"well i want it out of my house. i want it out of my life. but i think i look at it and i think, well i might be able to use that, or that might be something that somebody wants. even though my children have both told me they don't want any of it, and actually the son who is more organized in his life, he has said to me that if i die, he's just going to have somebody come in and just scoop it out, get rid of everything. i really do need to go through it all and make sure that i keep only what's really possibly of interest to the family and get rid of the rest of it."
006,006_046.txt,1,0.38550323247909546,"yeah, yeah, of course.",i'm getting to the age where i don't want to die and have all this extra they need to go through.
006,006_046.txt,1,0.3898274302482605,then what do you think would be the most important differences between what's considered normal saving behavior like collecting and hoarding disorder?,"i have so many collections, and overabundance of everything. so much of collections that they're no longer valuable, you know what i mean? yeah, go ahead."
006,006_046.txt,1,0.38853976130485535,"no, no, no. finish what you're saying.","i was just going to say, if i look at any one collection, i have so much of it that it's kind of lost its importance."
006,006_046.txt,1,0.5170767903327942,"okay, yeah.",i don't know how to describe that.
006,006_046.txt,1,0.4095347225666046,"no, you did a good job. then what would you think is the most important difference, if you started collecting something for value. then now that you say you have too much of it. what do you think is that line, where it goes into collecting, into hoarding.",when i don't even know where to put it.
006,006_046.txt,1,0.9123976826667786,"okay, yeah.",yeah.
006,006_046.txt,1,0.42826297879219055,let's see. do you think there's a way to tell if somebody has hoarding disorder without being in their home?,"perhaps, if i shopped with them and they were constantly picking up little things, like i do. if they were constantly picking up things and they thought, i could use that, or that might come in handy. then yeah, i would think that they have the same problem."
006,006_047.txt,1,0.6319519877433777,"okay. you think that because you have an issue with hoarding, that you would notice that? or do you think that if you didn't have one, maybe you wouldn't be as cognizant of it as you are now?",i probably would not be as cognizant of it.
006,006_047.txt,1,0.5249641537666321,"okay. you mentioned that you had gone up to the internet to find some information. have you tried going anywhere else or other places that you heard of it, other than the tv?","no. just, i've looked at websites and i've watched those tv shows and organization shows. i've read a couple organization books on how to get over the hoarding, but nothing's really helped. i guess it's helping, to the point where i know that i have an issue and i really want to do this, clean it out, get myself back on track."
006,006_047.txt,1,0.3302602171897888,yeah. yeah.,"it happens. but the desire to go out and shop though, i've got to tell you, even during quarantine, it's very easy not to go. but i find myself thinking, i can't wait to go to goodwill, or i can't wait to go look for that, you know?"
006,006_047.txt,1,0.5784586071968079,"yeah, no, of course. what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?","i think about myself. i think about my home, and how it looks piled with things."
006,006_047.txt,1,0.3163492977619171,"okay, yeah. now i want to focus a little bit more on covid impact. i know we talked a little bit about it. i want to talk about the specific behaviors that changed. you said that covid has helped you a little bit, because you haven't been able to go out and get as much stuff.",that is correct.
006,006_047.txt,1,0.5404326319694519,okay. has it impacted your difficulties with discarding?,"it may have made things easier for me to, because i'm looking at it constantly. i'm not running around. i'm looking at the stuff that i have and i have gradually started going through and for instance, i mentioned to you, the books. as soon as the local little church shop opened, i took a truckload of books to them. so yeah, in that way, in that i'm sitting here looking at it and thinking about it constantly, it has helped me get started going through some of it, and ridding myself of some of it. does that makes sense?"
006,006_047.txt,1,0.49095699191093445,"yeah, yeah, yeah. how do you think it's affected your sense of connectedness and attachment? do you think you've been seeing it more negative?",you mean with family and friends?
006,006_047.txt,1,0.38674572110176086,"yeah, like family and friends as well. or just your attachment to your items.","i think maybe it's helped me, because there's so much of it, i realize it's not important."
006,006_047.txt,1,0.7515639662742615,all right.,go ahead.
006,006_047.txt,1,0.36895275115966797,"no, no, finish.","there's a lot of it that i look at and i think, oh i wanted to do that with that, maybe i'll get around to that. well i never do get around to these things."
006,006_048.txt,1,0.40265753865242004,"okay. you feel like you've had more time to organize and de-clutter, but you haven't taken advantage of it?",yes.
006,006_048.txt,1,0.4540388584136963,"okay, all right. how has covid impacted your overall physical health?","well, part of it is the wildfires, i'm in california. part of it is the wildfires. we have ash falling daily. the doctor advised do not go out and walk. i usually walk for a couple of miles a day. but i've been pretty much stuck in the house, especially the last month."
006,006_048.txt,1,0.3184327185153961,"okay, yeah.","with covid, i live in a neighborhood where a lot of people walk. so i was going out very early in the morning to avoid a lot of people. because a lot of people around here are not wearing masks. i was going out very early. well then with the wildfires and all, i've kind of quit walking at all, and i feel very isolated now."
006,006_048.txt,1,0.45386964082717896,"no, yeah, of course. this has affected your overall health, your mental health and wellbeing, you would say as well?",yes.
006,006_048.txt,1,0.6539998054504395,okay. how has it affected you or your family financially?,"well, i'm retired, so it really hasn't affected me. my children are all able to work from home, so it hasn't affected them yet, totally."
006,006_048.txt,1,0.4232119023799896,"yeah, good, yeah. are there any specific techniques in this era that you've found helpful?","no, i don't know. i don't know exactly how to answer that. i'm moving more to audiobook. i'm working in my yard more. i do have, luckily, a backyard that i can escape to where no one else is around."
006,006_048.txt,1,0.5074567198753357,"would you say that that brings you comfort more than your items, for example?","actually, yes, it does."
006,006_048.txt,1,0.562561571598053,"good, yeah. you have something to do and put your hands on and stuff.","yeah. yeah. just the time to be able to focus on more serene things has helped. and i have done a few of the craft things that i wanted to do. but then, what stops me there is that i have to look for things through the piles, and that's another thing that's irritated me, that i really need to get rid of things so i can get to the stuff that i want. i don't know if that makes sense."
006,006_048.txt,1,0.6008331775665283,"no, yeah, it makes sense. it makes sense. would you say your motivation has stayed the same from before covid to now, in terms of seeking help for hoarding?",i think it's gotten better. i think my motivation has increased.
006,006_048.txt,1,0.5585343837738037,"okay, good.",i'm still not there.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.5357677340507507,have the people living with you changed during covid?,no.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.5860117077827454,okay. how have you kept in contact with family and friends?,"email, facebook, messaging, telephone, zoom."
006,006_049.txt,1,0.5727781653404236,okay. do you interact with them often?,daily.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.7648634314537048,daily.,not everybody daily.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.7084859609603882,that's good.,but yeah.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.5458035469055176,yeah.,but someone at least daily.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.44349002838134766,good. i know you mentioned that you were feeling a little bit lonely. did you feel socially isolated or lonely prior to covid?,no.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.47633612155914307,okay. then you would say that covid has affected your sense of isolation?,yes.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.5654139518737793,okay. have you experienced conflict during covid-19? with measures or anything else?,no.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.4107877314090729,"okay. that was the end of this little section. now, i want to go onto the section called vignettes, which is essentially, i'm going to read you a little prompt, then i'm going to ask you if the person in these prompts could have hoarding disorder, or their behavior's more cluttered rather than hoarding. then if this person should try to change their behavior, do you think they require treatment from a psychiatrist? and if it's similar or different than yours. i can repeat all these questions at the end of each little story if you want me to. i just wanted to give you a heads up.",okay.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.44215184450149536,okay. do you think that the person here could have hoarding disorder? or more clutter?,"i wouldn't call it either one, honestly. it sounds pretty normal to me."
006,006_049.txt,1,0.41524937748908997,okay yeah. do you think they should try to change their behavior?,could he find a specific spot to keep his keys and wallet?
006,006_049.txt,1,0.4459758698940277,"okay, yeah. you don't think that he would require treatment from a physician or a psychiatrist?",not really.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.697355329990387,"okay, yeah.",no.
006,006_049.txt,1,0.42416924238204956,would you say that this behavior is similar or different to your own.,"similar, i was never late for work or anything because of this. i do keep the boxes, but INAUDIBLE then because i keep thinking i'm going to put things in them to bring to the thrift shop."
006,006_050.txt,1,0.6900507807731628,"okay, yeah. i can go on to the next scenario if you're ready.",okay.
006,006_050.txt,1,0.34153905510902405,"john doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. when items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. he is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. stacks of boxes occupy every room. before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. his house is extremely cluttered, and it is difficult for him to walk in his house. often, it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. he is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.",wow.
006,006_050.txt,1,0.5138214230537415,do you think that this person could have hoarding disorder? or clutter problems?,could be both.
006,006_050.txt,1,0.43735864758491516,"okay, you think so? do you think that they should try to change their behavior?","yes, for the sake of work if nothing else."
006,006_050.txt,1,0.43132835626602173,"okay, yeah, that was a good answer. do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?","yeah. it sounds like me. if he can't get hold of it himself, yeah."
006,006_050.txt,1,0.4997800290584564,yeah. do you think this behavior's similar or different to your own?,"well, similar in that he keeps things he thinks he might use in the future. i never had to spend a lot of things i knew that i'd have to have for the next day, and i was never late for work or anything like that. that part of it is not like me. but the keeping the boxes in case you might need them, that sounds perfectly like me."
006,006_050.txt,1,0.35808414220809937,"okay, yeah. okay. the next one is, john doe has craft items that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. craft items occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. sometimes it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. when this happens, he is usually late in getting where he needs to be. okay. do you think that the person i read about here could have hoarding?",yes.
006,006_050.txt,1,0.513212263584137,okay. do you think that they should try to change their behavior?,yes.
006,006_050.txt,1,0.4264976382255554,okay. why or why not?,i think he probably is stressed from not being able to find what he needs to get through each day.
006,006_050.txt,1,0.3240220248699188,yeah.,"the fact that you have to move things to even take a shower, that's even more extreme than i am."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.48574474453926086,yeah. do you think that this kind of behavior should require treatment from a psychiatrist?,"possibly. i don't really know about that, that's what i need to learn about."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.36847764253616333,okay. is this behavior similar or different to yours?,"part of it's similar, in that i keep a lot of craft stuff in thinking that i might need it. i have some stuff in almost every room. although i don't have anything in my bathrooms and my guest room. but mainly it's my hallway, then my craft room. then i have a pile of stuff in my living room that i'm constantly working on, trying to go through. i can use my kitchen and bathrooms and stuff with no issue."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.33849138021469116,okay.,"like i said, i never had problems with, well, i shouldn't say i never did. i haven't for many, many years had trouble with finding keys or anything like that. once i decided where it was going to be, and always made sure it was there."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.7309142351150513,"okay. when it goes to getting to places, and your car keys and such, do you have a designated spot for that? or do you just always remember where it is?","yeah i have a designated spot, partly because i can't remember where things are half the time."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.45807409286499023,"okay, okay. then despite all the clutter and everything, that's always been a constant for you?","yeah, for the last 30 years, 40 years, probably yeah."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.358868271112442,good.,"early in my life, no. i used to have a lot of trouble. i always felt like, this sounds terrible, because i hate to blame my mother. she was a wonderful mother. but i wasn't taught how to organize, as a kid. i only learned that later, through working and school. yeah, organization's been a real problem for me."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.36068806052207947,"okay, yeah.","i have two sisters, who are the opposite of me. they're very neat, very tidy. my mother was very neat and tidy. i just always felt that i never learned it, i don't know why."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.6430415511131287,"okay, yeah.",sorry.
006,006_051.txt,1,0.597227931022644,"no, no, no, don't apologize, you're good. do you think that your sisters did retain the information that your mother tried teaching you? or do you not feel like your mother tried teaching you any kind of organization?","yeah. i was not taught any. in fact, my mom never, when we had to move her into an alzheimer's facility a few years ago, we realized she had never kept paperwork. we had to reconstruct things. she never filed things. i just never learned that from her."
006,006_051.txt,1,0.34269553422927856,"was that a case of, she never filed them, and instead she just threw them away?",yes.
006,006_052.txt,1,0.6812049150466919,"okay. all right, all right. she didn't keep them anywhere?","right, she did not."
006,006_052.txt,1,0.44655942916870117,all right.,caused a lot of trouble.
006,006_052.txt,1,0.6311433911323547,"yeah. yeah. good. i have one more vignette to go through. it's about value and things that are valuable. john doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable. he goes out once a week and buys more antiques. he's worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. antiques occupy every room. before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. often it is difficult for mr. doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. he is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. okay. do you think this person has hoarding disorder?",not sure if it's hoarding or just organization.
006,006_052.txt,1,0.33591702580451965,okay. yeah.,"i'm very like that, with things that i think are valuable, and i don't want to just get rid of them because they might have some value. either to me or to someone else later."
006,006_052.txt,1,0.3085910379886627,okay.,"but i find a lot of times, when i want to get rid of things i think, well i can at least try to have a yard sale, because this is actually a valuable item, even though it no longer is to me or to my children, i still know that it has a monetary value. so it's difficult to let go."
006,006_052.txt,1,0.6623295545578003,"okay. with that kind of item, would you be willing to sell it? or would you be willing to give it away in some kind of yard sale?","if i knew it was going to someone that would appreciate it, i would be willing to give it."
006,006_052.txt,1,0.5975585579872131,okay. good. how do you think your family would feel? if they heard you say ... do you consider that some kind of progress? that you could give it away if you knew it was going to a home where it was going to be appreciated?,"yeah, probably. they would think it was progress for me."
006,006_052.txt,1,0.5513900518417358,would you consider that progress for you? if you were able to do that?,"yeah, i guess."
006,006_052.txt,1,0.45334911346435547,you don't sound too convinced.,"i'm not. i'm really struggling with this. i have so much that i enjoy, even though i know it's useless to someone else. i don't know. it's very difficult to decide. go ahead."
006,006_053.txt,1,0.422500878572464,"i was going to ask what you thought would have been progress for you, or baby steps?","well, i think i made progress with the books. i am trying to go through the sewing room, and cleaning out stuff. but every time i look at something, i think i can use that. i really need to just decide, i could replace this if i needed to, so it's okay to let it go now to someone who could use it. i just have a hard time. i know logically what should be done, but emotionally, it's very, very difficult for me."
006,006_053.txt,1,0.3331563472747803,"yeah, that's a good answer. yeah. part of throwing things away is that they won't be able to be used anymore, and that'll just be the end of the item's life cycle.",yeah.
006,006_053.txt,1,0.4318311810493469,so you would rather give them away to someone where it can still continue to get used?,yes.
006,006_053.txt,1,0.345747172832489,"okay. thrift stores and places like that, would that make you feel better if you gave your stuff away to thrift stores instead of throwing it away?",yes.
006,006_053.txt,1,0.5857607126235962,"okay, good. back to the vignette, do you think that the person's behavior is similar or different to your own?",similar.
006,006_053.txt,1,0.3792527914047241,similar? okay. in what ways?,"well you mentioned antiques in this vignette. i do have some things that are, like i said, i have a lot of collections that i kind of treasure. but i know that to somebody else they're probably valueless. although, i also know there are other people like me that might want them. i just know that, i guess they're providing emotional support to me in some way, or i wouldn't bother with them. because i have friends who have no difficulty when something's been used and they're done with it, they just toss it. even though i see value in it."
006,006_053.txt,1,0.5312790870666504,right.,they don't have any trouble letting go.
006,006_053.txt,1,0.5909437537193298,okay.,"i do, and i don't understand that."
006,006_053.txt,1,0.5450120568275452,yeah. you would definitely say that it's more emotional?,yeah.
006,006_053.txt,1,0.45529088377952576,okay good. so you can recognize when something has reached the end of its use and you still wouldn't want to throw it away?,that is correct.
006,006_053.txt,1,0.42802542448043823,"i know you mentioned that you wanted to get sewing back again. what if it was a sewing machine that had broken, and it was beyond repair? would you be willing to throw that away? or do you think that you would still try to get some use out of it?","yeah, i would pass it along."
006,006_053.txt,1,0.32489198446273804,okay.,"if i can't use it, and it's machinery or something, yeah, i'd be happy to pass it along. i have a collection right now of vintage linens. a huge collection of handmade linen doilies and bedspreads and tablecloths. i don't need them. my kids don't want them. to them, they're just old fashioned. but i cannot let go of them. i don't know what it is. i just have this hard time letting go."
006,006_054.txt,1,0.45844176411628723,"yeah, no, it makes sense. especially with something that, did you make those doilies?","no, no. the things that my grandmother made and passed to me, i've kept and i've labeled them for my kids. but anytime i go to an estate sale or a yard sale or anything and there's vintage handmade things, i snap them up because i think, i don't want them to be thrown away or discarded, some people put a lot of time and effort into that."
006,006_054.txt,1,0.5090833306312561,yeah.,even though i have no use for it. i do use some things. but i can't possibly use everything i have.
006,006_054.txt,1,0.27918925881385803,yes.,"really, i basically have come to the realization that i just need to avoid any place where i might be tempted to bring things home. if i don't see it, i won't do it. this is completely off topic for you and i'm sorry to interrupt, somebody said to me recently that she doesn't look at home décor magazines or websites or anything because it always gave her a sense that she needed more, or she needed to do something to her home. and i realized that i have spent years looking through magazines, books, and lifestyle tv shows and trying to update my life to go along with that, or things that i want to try in my house. i realize, maybe if i'm not looking at all that stuff all the time, i won't. i'll be satisfied with things the way they are."
006,006_054.txt,1,0.2996346950531006,okay. yeah.,"yeah. i've stopped. i had a few magazine subscriptions that i have let lapse because of that. i'm not taking any kind of magazines anymore at all. because i was afraid. i thought, perhaps, that it would help me not to be looking to change things all the time. i don't know."
006,006_054.txt,1,0.31188538670539856,"yeah, no, that makes sense. it relates to how, obviously covid is a much bigger scale. but you mentioned that because you're not able to go out, you find yourself buying less things. it sounds like the same thought process applied here. if you're not looking at all these things, then you might not be as prone to getting them or storing them.",correct.

006,006_055.txt,1,0.4871883988380432,okay.,i need to quit trying to emulate everything that i see.
006,006_055.txt,1,0.547049343585968,"yeah. yeah, no, that makes sense. do you think that that friend, when she told you that, do you think that she's gotten better with not buying so much home décor things?","i think she has, yeah."

006,006_055.txt,1,0.47213757038116455,"yeah. when you work on these projects, do you normally complete them?","no. because that's the other issue. i have all these grand ideas, then i get started and i lose interest."

006,006_055.txt,1,0.6258403062820435,"do you think it's because some of the projects you take on are really big and require a lot of steps? do you think that they were maybe smaller projects with less steps, you'd be more prone to finishing them and feeling a little bit more satisfied?","maybe. i'm not too sure. because it seems like i can't actually start something and complete it, anything."
006,006_055.txt,1,0.579792320728302,"yeah. yeah, that makes sense. okay. if that's everything you have on your mind right now, i can go ahead and end the recording, if you'd like?","okay, okay."

007,007_056.txt,1,0.5062572956085205,okay. have you ever sought to change this behavior? have you gone for professional help?,"i didn't know there was professional help for cluttering. when i was moving in 2010, i paid someone to come in and help me, and she was very good because she would say, ""oh, when's the last time you used this?"" and i'd say, INAUDIBLE, y'know. ""two years ago? you don't need this."" that's what i needed, is somebody to do that for me."

007,007_057.txt,1,0.37765735387802124,it's in your house.,"yeah, yeah. it becomes, when you are the depository of family things, my mother would say ... she passed away in 2011, but she would say, ""it's just stuff. it's just INAUDIBLE,"" and, somehow, you feel obliged to watch out for it and it goes beyond just sentimental to, i don't know what the word is that i'm searching for, but it's beyond sentimentality and becomes almost an obligation to preserve whatever the memory is."
007,007_057.txt,1,0.5812861919403076,"you feel like a sense of responsibility, maybe? or?","yeah, i think so."

CROSSTALK","yes, my daughter is very, very unhappy about it. fortunately, i'm very grateful to say that she doesn't seem to have the hoarding gene or, at least, she hasn't given in to it, i guess is the word i'm wanting to say. so, i'm grateful for that, but i know that it drives her nuts and she wouldn't invite anyone inside my house, and i wouldn't blame her."

007,007_057.txt,1,0.5178134441375732,okay.,he pretty much has no choice in the matter.
007,007_057.txt,1,0.5802876949310303,okay. can you describe your place a little bit? you mentioned it was a one bedroom. do you live with a partner?,"no. no, no, i live alone, thank goodness."
007,007_057.txt,1,0.37055325508117676,okay.,"maybe if i lived with someone, maybe it would be neater."
007,007_057.txt,1,0.37148919701576233,"it's possible, but sometimes ...","i could still hide things. i know that i would still hide things and try to hold on to things, but have it in the boxes, in the corners. my former husband was something of a pack rat, too, so between the two of us, it was a disaster."

007,007_058.txt,1,0.4604319930076599,"so, would you consider every part of your home to be cluttered?","yes, yes."
007,007_058.txt,1,0.6840876340866089,and is it things in boxes that's making them cluttered or is it just furniture or books or puzzles?,not really furniture so much. it's more stuff on the furniture.
007,007_058.txt,1,0.6683965921401978,okay.,stuff. it's just stuff.
007,007_058.txt,1,0.7809351682662964,it's just a collection of miscellaneous items?,calling it a collection is a very generous description.
007,007_058.txt,1,0.5666527152061462,"okay. okay, on the flip side, what would you like your home to look like in an ideal world?","oh, i would love it to be neat and tidy, and be able to open the door and invite anyone in instead of having to move stuff off the couch, so that somebody could sit on it. that i'd be able to say, ""oh, come in. have a seat."" i would love to have that. absolutely love to have it."
007,007_058.txt,1,0.7449396848678589,"okay, and how important is it for to feel at home? how important are your things for you to feel at home?",how important are my things...
007,007_058.txt,1,0.4819229245185852,yeah.,for me to feel at home?
007,007_058.txt,1,0.322824090719223,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"i have no idea how to answer that because there are some thing that if somebody came in and then got rid of them on my behalf, i'd be very grateful and other things, i'd say, ""whew, i don't really want to get rid of that,"" and there's also things where i go, ""oh, i forgot i had that."" ""oh, look at this."" when you get to the bottom of a pile, it's like your compass on a mission of discovery. whoo-hoo!"
007,007_058.txt,1,0.6230619549751282,"okay, when you think about all your items, which would you say are most important for you and you spend the most time with?","i spend the most time with my laptop, actually."
007,007_058.txt,1,0.501133143901825,all right.,"yeah, that's the biggie for me."
007,007_059.txt,1,0.5579801201820374,"but after that, do you, maybe, read a lot? i know you mentioned you like puzzles, do you have a large collection of puzzles?","i do have a lot of puzzles. the problem with reading is i had cataract surgery and lenses replaced. i'm extremely near-sighted, but i never had trouble reading. now, i have trouble sitting down and reading. they were not able to correct my stigmatism, so even with correcting reading glasses, it's uncomfortable for me to read, and that drives me nuts. that is just a heartbreak for me because i used to read incessantly. i was an avid reader and, now, it's uncomfortable and it's not a wonderful thing, and that breaks my heart most of all."
007,007_059.txt,1,0.47974658012390137,"yeah, i'm very hard to hear that. that sounds like its been very difficult for you. so, then, you're mostly just using your computers and puzzles, you'd say?","yes, i would say so."
007,007_059.txt,1,0.35209205746650696,"okay. again, when you think about all your possessions, what makes them valuable? how do you determine when an object is valuable or not?","i guess sentimentality is one and then, it's like finding a plan, i know the whole idea of taking a picture of something and then you can preserve it, but then i have to think, well i take a picture of it, and then i have to identify it. then i have to take the picture and then i take things to snap this, which is one of the... you can make photo books and things. so, i have all of these plans. ""oh, i'm going to do that,"" so my kids and my grandkids can look back on family history and see all of this. then i just don't click because it has to be perfect."
007,007_059.txt,1,0.3811150789260864,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"it has to be just right and if i can't get it just right, then i get frustrated and i stop, because it isn't perfect."
007,007_059.txt,1,0.6348704695701599,one way you value objects is based on their memory associated or the sentimentality of that object?,"yes. sentimentality and perceived usability, either immediate or possible future use of the living, which is where i really get into trouble. CROSSTALK how can you be of use some day and, then, some day comes and you either forget you have it or you can't find it."
007,007_060.txt,1,0.5737192034721375,"okay. the opposite side of that question is, what do you consider trash and what do you throw away? do you know when it's time to get rid of something?","well, one of the problems with throwing away things is i really believe, strongly, in recycling and reusing, so it's very difficult for me to just throw something away. in fact, i have a broken scale that used a nine volt battery, but the battery, i mean, it's years old and the battery had rusted onto the gizmo that the nine volt battery hooks into. it has the two round things on the end that snap. so, it's unusable. you can't get a weight without the battery and the battery is rusted onto the ends of it, and i checked with the local head. you can't recycle things like scales or a coffee pot that doesn't work anymore."
007,007_060.txt,1,0.3538469672203064,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,you have to throw them away and i haven't been able to do that because i just think there should be something better to do with it. it's very strange.
007,007_060.txt,1,0.4885314702987671,okay.,you'll be dealing with a lot of strange people.
007,007_060.txt,1,0.39580467343330383,"when it comes to discarding, you have difficulties throwing something away because you really believe in recycling and when you don't find the right place, you just hold onto it for when something will change?","yeah, probably, or just ..."
007,007_060.txt,1,0.33349770307540894,a guilt thing?,"one of the problems, as i said, i have something called spinal stenosis, which i didn't know till late last year, and it has impacted my ability to walk and to stand, and when you are sorting things and going through things, you have to be just, generally, standing up."
007,007_060.txt,1,0.33831334114074707,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"so, about 10 minutes is my limit for standing up and instead of saying, ""okay, i'll take a break for 20 minutes and come back to it,"" i'll do 10 minutes and stop. that's an issue that i have."
007,007_060.txt,1,0.4869649410247803,"yeah. yeah, sounds like it would be very difficult. you mentioned that you do think you have too much stuff and that you know that you need to be getting rid of some things, but what would you consider your most precious item in your house for you?","probably the photographs and there's a box of photographs. then, i have a vase that my daughter made for me. sentimental things. there's an ornament from kind of close to where i grew up that a relative was involved in, starting a christmas eve choir of men that go around and sing. they still do it. 170 years later, they're still going around the town and singing the christmas carols on christmas eve. they start at midnight and go all night. i have an ornament from that. so, that is something that i want my children and grandchildren to appreciate. i guess it's things that i would want my family to, maybe appreciate is the wrong word. maybe that's my problem, is a i appreciate it too much."
007,007_060.txt,1,0.4941168427467346,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"who needs it, really? but, i couldn't bring myself to throw it away."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.4841631054878235,what would happen if you lost it or it accidentally got thrown away?,"oh, i'd be very upset with myself. what can you say? that's just ..."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.5000306367874146,"mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. another version of this question is, if you had to choose between your items, how would you make that decision? how would you choose?","i don't know. i have no idea. honestly, have not a clue how i would do that."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.6082546710968018,"okay. that's a fine response. i mean, it'd be a very difficult decision to make.","yeah, yeah. again, if you have to make it, you have to make it, but it'd certainly not be an easy thing if you have to."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.2743604779243469,yeah.,"yeah, you'd have to do it and it's just, again, it's a matter of the feelings of guilt, or maybe getting rid of something that you should've held on to or that you should've appreciated more than you did."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.5110176801681519,"that's a good point. okay. you mentioned that your behavior does upset you a bit, do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?","hard to say, but what's gotten in the way of my daily life is the whole spinal stenosis thing and, frankly, my inability to get around like i used to. i used to take ... and, of course, coronavirus, because the gym that i go to that is part of my healthcare."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.4009537100791931,therapy?,"well, no, the medicare insurance i've got includes membership in a really good, local gym."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.37024861574172974,okay.,"with coronavirus, they're closed. so, i can't do that. so, that has, frankly, interfered with my ability to feel like i'm staying in shape and stay in touch. i used to take thai chi, very intensive thai chi, and i can't take that right now because i can't stand long enough to do even a single part of the form."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.38801297545433044,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,that's very frustrating. there's more than just the clutter going on here. it's also my current physical limitations. it's extremely frustrating.
007,007_061.txt,1,0.33724743127822876,"so, you would say more that, it is, now, your health has impacted how you get around your house?",exactly.
007,007_061.txt,1,0.4861674904823303,"so, it's become more of a burden on you?","yes, exactly."
007,007_061.txt,1,0.40813544392585754,"it's more noticeable that there's, oh, this is actually a more difficult way to live because of your current situation?",yes.
007,007_061.txt,1,0.42653217911720276,"okay. you touched a little bit about how covid's impacted your life, we actually have a set of questions that's, specifically, about covid. you mentioned that you can no longer go to the gym and that you've had the surgery. you said in june, right?","june, yes."
007,007_062.txt,1,0.40704140067100525,"okay. besides that big surgery, how is your mental health or overall well-being been?","i am an introvert. INAUDIBLE introvert and even i have had, sometimes i go, ""geez, it'd be nice to be able to go and see someone."" another thing that it has done is impact my ability to drive. my best friend lives about three and a half hours away. i cannot physically drive to see her because my leg was severely impacted by the spinal stenosis. it still has not recuperated. i can't have it in one position for more than about 20 minutes when you're driving."
007,007_062.txt,1,0.31062421202659607,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"it's impossible for me to go visit my best friend. we can talk on the phone, but i'm really okay. given a choice between being in a crowd and being alone, give me alone. so, from the point of view of social isolation, i almost welcome it because i am very introverted."
007,007_062.txt,1,0.300258606672287,okay.,"and i think that might be something to look at, too, if these people are introverts or extroverts. to see if that would have an impact on their clutter problems."
007,007_062.txt,1,0.5696291923522949,"no, that's a very interesting concept to think about because most times people tend to live alone or they also comment that they're introverts. so, has covid affected your buying habits? do you tend to shop a lot?","not really. i don't go to the store very much because the stores around here, on 75, stores around here, have the senior hours from six to seven a.m. which i appreciate that they have senior hours, but, yeah, six to seven a.m. is not a time i'm up and about. bright eyed and bushy tailed. i, as i said, am grateful that they have the shopping hours, but i don't get out to them too much. i'll get things online. i know that that is one issue that people in my situation have, is buying too much online."
007,007_062.txt,1,0.7022416591644287,would you say you've been buying a lot online? like more than normal?,"i don't think more than normal. no, i don't think more than normal. i try to be more conscious about it and not get too carried away with online shopping. i know it can be a very dangerous habit to have."
007,007_062.txt,1,0.3810579776763916,"yes, it's very easy to click a button.","oh, yes, too easy. CROSSTALK you can imagine it's the same thing because i have been to very many casinos, but when i lived in philadelphia, when atlantic city casinos first opened back in the early 70s, and there was a conference there that co-workers and i went to, and we agreed that we could spot at this casino because none of us had ever been. i took a roll of quarters and kept the quarters, i put them in my left pocket, and i would put them in. this was physical where you pull the one armed bandit and pull it down, and the things go around."
007,007_062.txt,1,0.32731133699417114,oh yeah.,"then, when you win something, it goes clink, clink, clink, and i would take anything that came out; i would put it in my right hand pocket, and when i got to the end of the five dollar roll of quarters, i had this urge to go into the pocket that had the things that came out and start spending that, and i said, ""no, that's stupid,"" even though it was something i could afford, but i just got that urge. i realized it's too easy to get hooked on that."

007,007_063.txt,1,0.29968956112861633,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"so, i stay away from it because i'm an ex-smoker. i have an addictive personality, so i have to stay away from that kind of thing because i can see that it can become too enjoyable. same with online shopping. you have to be hyper aware of what you're doing and why. i'm a salesperson. ""whew, there's a sale. let me go,"" and look at the sale. i'm just babbling. i'm sorry."
007,007_063.txt,1,0.5363509058952332,"no, you're good. basically, you've just been trying to really watch your shopping and your buying habits during covid because it's really easy to online shop?","exactly. exactly, and i can get drawn in by a sale. we're having a sale and 30% off, whew. i have to tell me, ""you don't need that."" ""you have a jacket for fall and a coat for winter. you don't need to go to the ll bean sale and try to get some stuff."" yeah, i fall for the, ""get it before it's too late. get it now while we still have supplies."""

007,007_064.txt,1,0.3723994195461273,"okay. also, during quarantine and covid, how has your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items, has it increased? do you feel like your items are more important to have around?","no, actually, i'm more testy with them."

007,007_064.txt,1,0.7475742697715759,okay.,exactly.

007,007_065.txt,1,0.3786448836326599,"okay. now, we're just going to talk a little bit about distinguishing typical hoarding behavior from what would be considered normal behavior? so, what would you consider the most important difference between what is considered normal, sane behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?","organization and the ability to dis-attach. ability to, maybe, accept that it's not really perfect and it will never be perfect. to make it the best you can."

007,007_065.txt,1,0.5229008197784424,okay. what would you say hoarding disorder looks like and how is that same or different from your behavior?,"you just can't get rid of stuff. it's about the same. you bring stuff in and then, you buy a pair of socks and you don't get rid of a pair of socks. you just have a lot of pair of socks. i think it's an inability to balance the intake with the outflow, perhaps."
007,007_065.txt,1,0.47173967957496643,"okay, that's a really good way of putting it. no one's ever said that. where would you say you get most of your information about hoarding disorder from? do you read about it or do you watch news?","no. no, no, no. i live it, so why would i need those things? why would i need to read about it? i never read anything that helps me. i do see the books and the konmari method, and the problem with that is everything feels wonderful for me, so i can't risk CROSSTALK."
007,007_065.txt,1,0.4318041503429413,when did you first learn of this term or this disorder?,"i don't know. i don't know. i have no idea. i couldn't tell you. i know that there was ... i used to work for television LISTING, and what is that, hoarders, or something that's around that i can't bring myself to watch. a&e, i think?"
007,007_065.txt,1,0.6990014910697937,"yeah, it is hoarders.","okay, that's hoarders. yeah, and i think that's probably where we adapted to the term."
007,007_065.txt,1,0.3750559389591217,"okay. all right. this last section is what we call little vignettes. basically, they're little scenarios and then at the end ... i'm going to read you a little paragraph and then, at the end, you're just going to say if you think this person has hoarding disorder or if it's more being cluttered, and then, if they should try to change their behavior and if you think they need treatment from a psychiatrist, and if their behavior is similar or different to your own. then i can go over the questions again after i read them.",okay.
007,007_066.txt,1,0.5543386340141296,would you say that this hoarding disorder or is it more clutter problems?,he doesn't sound like a clutterer.

007,007_066.txt,1,0.5341770052909851,okay.,"definitely not a hoarding situation, in my opinion."
007,007_066.txt,1,0.5214643478393555,"okay, and then how would you say this ... is it similar or different to your own?",it's different because i don't just have one closet with my stuff in it.
007,007_066.txt,1,0.5002565979957581,okay.,i have a closet that's pretty neat. i'm the exact opposite.

007,007_067.txt,1,0.4325377345085144,"okay, yeah. there are treatment options available if you see a psychiatrist. okay, so you would say that one does?",yes.

008,008_069.txt,1,0.4802675247192383,has it increased steadily as you've gotten older?,"no, if anything it's probably a little better, but pretty mild i would say."

008,008_069.txt,1,0.546244204044342,okay.,i can't think of anything.
008,008_069.txt,1,0.7750271558761597,"just started kind of collecting more and more things, or you were always kind of a collector?",always kind of a collector.
008,008_069.txt,1,0.6577866673469543,and why is it tough to get rid of it for you?,some of the stuff that's hardest to get rid of is if it was given to me by somebody else.
008,008_069.txt,1,0.31036514043807983,okay.,"there's some sense that i shouldn't just throw it away because of that, or there will be some projects that i've never finish that it's very difficult to get rid of because i feel guilty that i never finished it."
008,008_069.txt,1,0.5261001586914062,okay.,and i probably never will.
008,008_069.txt,1,0.7723451852798462,you know?,yeah.
008,008_070.txt,1,0.5080294013023376,wow. what was that like for you to finally throw it out?,"certainly stressful, and it was, i guess, i felt very guilty about never finishing it."
008,008_070.txt,1,0.4798823297023773,sure.,"but i think now that it's gone i'll probably never think about this again, hopefully."
008,008_070.txt,1,0.6813334226608276,and how does that feel to kind of think about how you won't be thinking about it again?,"i'm looking forward to not thinking about it, maybe not feeling guilty, but it has certainly been, for what is basically just a pile of paper and a couple note books, i've thought about it way more than i want this week."
008,008_070.txt,1,0.4587755501270294,"of course, you're going to ...",i don't know if i'm answering your questions.
008,008_070.txt,1,0.38117715716362,i think having that insight can help facilitate more discarding of stuff.,"yeah, and i probably have, a little bit unique in the sense of seeing my dad with it, that i've been aware that it's an issue since i was young."
008,008_070.txt,1,0.40468668937683105,are there other emotions that are pretty related to your problems with hoarding?,that's probably the biggest one.

008,008_074.txt,1,0.45002835988998413,oh wow.,"so, he didn't talk about it a lot."
008,008_074.txt,1,0.506244421005249,it's crazy how much time's have changed since their generation.,yeah.
008,008_074.txt,1,0.38670405745506287,isn't it?,"yeah, from not really having enough to eat all the time to now."
008,008_074.txt,1,0.35873574018478394,right.,"but even from a very young kid, i knew he'd dog ear a page, never highlight anything."
008,008_074.txt,1,0.41972652077674866,yeah.,he'd carry them around on a silk pillow.
008,008_074.txt,1,0.5321536660194397,wow.,"so, i picked up a lot of that."
008,008_075.txt,1,0.3671799600124359,"which, probably then, had you pick that up, start hoarding and stuff.",exactly.
008,008_075.txt,1,0.45550402998924255,what do you think differentiates those two?,i think of collectors ... i have a friend that collects a lot of stuff.
008,008_075.txt,1,0.4186898469924927,okay.,"he'll collect something for a few years, and then when he's done collecting it he'll just get rid of all of it."
008,008_075.txt,1,0.31647512316703796,wow.,"and the stuff that he collects, there's some value, like with comic books, or he's collected matchbox cars for awhile."
008,008_075.txt,1,0.3681598901748657,"so, he goes through the effort to collect all this stuff and then just gets rid of it?",yeah.
008,008_075.txt,1,0.4643494188785553,and then just sells it all?,"yeah, and he'll often make money by doing it."
008,008_075.txt,1,0.6688278317451477,hopefully.,yeah.
008,008_075.txt,1,0.28805071115493774,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,but he gets a lot of pleasure out of collecting and acquiring it but not really having it.
008,008_075.txt,1,0.34376904368400574,"your friend, it's more kind of like a game, kind of like a hobby, and for you it's having those items that represent family ...",yeah.
008,008_075.txt,1,0.41367262601852417,"is there a way to tell if someone has a hoarding disorder without being in their home, do you think?",hmm.
008,008_075.txt,1,0.32731667160987854,of course.,"you know, i've coming from maybe a pop-psychology perspective, but i think it would ..."
008,008_075.txt,1,0.3701488673686981,okay.,... i think would be more likely to hard or collect stuff.
008,008_075.txt,1,0.3948154151439667,right.,"... very well, like carrying books around on silk pillows, so to speak."
008,008_076.txt,1,0.6359437704086304,sure.,INAUDIBLE
008,008_076.txt,1,0.47131606936454773,"what are some personality traits, you think, that would maybe give you an idea of that?",yeah.
008,008_076.txt,1,0.5566637516021729,do you think it really won't make a difference?,"yeah, i don't know that depravation alone causes it."
008,008_076.txt,1,0.6277673840522766,sure.,but it's still there.
008,008_076.txt,1,0.6063738465309143,totally.,and maybe ...
008,008_076.txt,1,0.2757531702518463,yeah.,"but if people are feeling more disconnected in the modern world, and there's more stress, or isolation maybe there's going to be more hoarding."
008,008_076.txt,1,0.4481836259365082,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,and certainly to even acquire stuff.
008,008_076.txt,1,0.4431021511554718,"yeah, it's been interesting with covid too, how that's changed, which i do have ... i will ask you those questions too.",oh okay.
008,008_076.txt,1,0.39233681559562683,"so, any other way, do you think, to tell that someone is hoarding without being in their home?",i guess ... i listed personality traits.
008,008_076.txt,1,0.45828521251678467,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,"so, i think that would work, or certainly probably worked in my case."
008,008_076.txt,1,0.6326150298118591,and if you can't think of anything else that's fine.,okay.
008,008_076.txt,1,0.4970993995666504,"so, that makes sense to me.",yeah. i think a lot of orderliness might be a sign of it.
008,008_077.txt,1,0.3705923855304718,"yeah, certain things that maybe people care about the most are actually organized.",yeah.
008,008_077.txt,1,0.565801739692688,"so, now we're going to go into the third part of this.",okay.
008,008_077.txt,1,0.999997615814209,okay.,okay.
008,008_077.txt,1,0.4904891550540924,do you think this has hoarded?,"i'm laughing to myself because i have lots of boxes, and that probably is something that's a little hard for me to get rid of, especially with all the moves."
008,008_077.txt,1,0.39985793828964233,do you think that's ...,"i mean, it's not significantly affecting his quality of life."
008,008_077.txt,1,0.4545842707157135,right.,"so, i would say maybe he's got some signs of it, but i wouldn't say that he's got a disorder."
008,008_078.txt,1,0.5002058148384094,what do you think about this person?,"yeah, definitely a disorder."
008,008_078.txt,1,0.3837757110595703,"so, why do you think this person has it versus that person that doesn't?",just from the impact on his quality of life.
008,008_078.txt,1,0.47130993008613586,and where do you see yourself in between these two people?,pretty close to the first one.
008,008_078.txt,1,0.656719982624054,okay.,but not ...
008,008_078.txt,1,0.26993653178215027,sure.,"and there's no sense of the inner emotional state of either john doe, and i think that that inner emotional state probably is tied to why, for one, he values the boxes so much more than he values other things."
008,008_078.txt,1,0.41535288095474243,right.,like being able to get into his bathroom.
008,008_078.txt,1,0.34395572543144226,right.,"and that's probably the key point, is that internal value system, how out of whack is that relative to just being..."
008,008_078.txt,1,0.45460277795791626,definitely.,you have sort of practically function in life in that sense.
008,008_078.txt,1,0.3926735520362854,"so, it's the quality of life.","on the surface i'd look like number one, but i probably have all that stuff of number two."

009,009_087.txt,1,0.3125324249267578,"so, it sounds like when you have the most difficulty getting rid of something is actually getting rid of it because you can't decide if it needs to be thrown away or recycled or donated?",yeah.
009,009_087.txt,1,0.521924614906311,"so, when you think about all your possessions, what is the most precious item in your house?","oh. well, something that i definitely wouldn't want to lost in a fire or something would be my picture albums."

009,009_088.txt,1,0.5870171189308167,"so, when you think about all of these items that you have, how would you choose between them if you had to get rid of something?","i would probably go through and which ritual objects do i still use, well, and of course right now all of that's in advance because of covid, go through my sheet music and those kind of songs i don't do anymore, give this to somebody, go through the old electronics and just dump all of that because now with garageband and all of that i don't use that stuff anymore."

009,009_091.txt,1,0.4814761281013489,"so, for this next section what do you figure the most important differences between what is normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?","well, i would think collecting is you're collecting things that you love, you're passionate about, that add enjoyment to your life, and that are decorative or useful, for example, my egg cups, i use them."
009,009_091.txt,1,0.609767735004425,"so, we touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you expand on what you think hoarding looks like and how it is the same or different from your own behavior?","well, i would say i am a hoarder because i am keeping things that are not necessary or useful or don't add joy to my life and that is visible."

015,015_161.txt,1,0.46868279576301575,so do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?,i don't know of any way.
015,015_161.txt,1,0.5046032071113586,have you gotten any information on it or?,"the tv show, of course."
015,015_161.txt,1,0.3086746037006378,what was the information that they gave you.,that they were hoarders and that their house has just one little path to walk through.
015,015_161.txt,1,0.3946263790130615,"so when you watched hoarders, what did you take away from that show?","certainly, i'm sure they bring the most extreme people on for the effect."
015,015_161.txt,1,0.42542991042137146,they do bring on the really extreme cases.,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
015,015_162.txt,1,0.4816872775554657,do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?,sometimes and i think part of it is the timing of it.
015,015_162.txt,1,0.5813742280006409,"do you think it's ever gotten in the way of something that you've really wanted, or is it just more of a day to day it can get annoying and frustrating.",i think more day to day.
015,015_162.txt,1,0.5511242151260376,has it impacted your work at all?,"i'd say my living at home a little bit, but at my work work you're talking about, is that what you mean?"
015,015_162.txt,1,0.47258973121643066,or anything like that?,"no, but my job is it's a..."
015,015_163.txt,1,0.4486933648586273,"okay. and so your children, i know we've briefly talked about this before, but you said that they don't really get upset about it at all, right?",not really.
015,015_163.txt,1,0.5502637624740601,and then move on.,yeah.

015,015_163.txt,1,0.5071191191673279,and so our last question is would you like to change and why or why not?,i would say i would just so things are neater.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.5912989974021912,so the first question i'd like to ask you is what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?,the first thing that came to mind was disorganized or disorganization.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.40793052315711975,okay.,"because i know i'm not a hoarder, but i just never get around to finishing stuff."
016,016_164.txt,1,0.39218631386756897,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,and every room is full of unfinished stuff and things.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.581363320350647,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,i guess i don't care.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.5111992359161377,"okay, we can just go with problems with disorganization, that's fine.",okay.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.4433946907520294,could you please describe your problems with clutter for me?,"essentially, i'm a very neat, organized person, and that's how i lived my life until i was 70 years old."
016,016_164.txt,1,0.22521880269050598,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,and my life's work was being a librarian in large research hospitals and in a college environment.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.37209174036979675,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE okay.,i think what comes to mind immediately is my financial difference.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.46564972400665283,so you've been saying that this has been happening for the past four years?,correct.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.6736889481544495,has it gotten better or worse?,it's much worse.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.5029419660568237,"okay, and is that because of you being on a budget and having less financial income?","yes, because if i had that income, i could higher people to clean."
016,016_164.txt,1,0.6177871823310852,okay.,no way out of this.
016,016_164.txt,1,0.5419846177101135,is there a lack of motivation to do it yourself?,"i'm overwhelmed at this point, because i don't even know where to start."

016,016_165.txt,1,0.4448658227920532,so it goes back to that feeling of being overwhelmed and feeling trapped?,"yes, and alone with the problem."
016,016_165.txt,1,0.644439697265625,do you believe that your behavior is a problem?,it's a problem for me.
016,016_165.txt,1,0.40883463621139526,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,i don't know anyone else except my brother's wife who is the biggest slob i've ever encountered in my life.
016,016_165.txt,1,0.422678679227829,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,"i think she wouldn't notice, but anyone else i know would notice big time."
016,016_165.txt,1,0.3875519931316376,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,and that would make me very embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.
016,016_165.txt,1,0.37318873405456543,so it goes back to those feelings of shame and embarrassment?,"yes, yes."
016,016_165.txt,1,0.4339514374732971,and how do your family and friends feel about your behavior?,"like i said, i don't let anybody in my house anymore except my best friend."

016,016_165.txt,1,0.40242406725883484,and have you ever had conflicts with people close to you or landlords about your behavior?,"no, because i've owned this house for about 19 years, i think."
016,016_165.txt,1,0.3350779712200165,have you ever sought to change this behavior?,"yes, that's why i finally decided that i needed to assign one of my three bedrooms to be the place that i would put things i'm considering getting rid of."
016,016_165.txt,1,0.43678683042526245,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,there's a large closet that's filled with clothes and the bottom is filled with shoes.
016,016_165.txt,1,0.5189575552940369,okay.,i look at my easy chair with ottoman.
016,016_165.txt,1,0.42704591155052185,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,the chest beside the sofa is covered with stacks of books.
016,016_166.txt,1,0.48443081974983215,sounds like a lot.,"there's another table thing that has a bunch of magazines on the top, tchotchkes and stuff."
016,016_166.txt,1,0.3882283568382263,"so going back to what you said, you said that you assigned one of your bedrooms that are supposed to be disposed of or given away.",yes.
016,016_166.txt,1,0.34287869930267334,why do you think you haven't be able to bring yourself to bring those items out since you've already separated them from the rest?,"well, actually a big part of it is the pandemic."
016,016_166.txt,1,0.3621184229850769,"right, okay.","the books i had planned to sell at half price books, the largest one in austin, texas is about two miles from me, and they have recently reopened, but i don't feel safe."
016,016_166.txt,1,0.47135910391807556,okay.,"so even with gloves and a mask, i don't feel safe in that space."

016,016_166.txt,1,0.5020602345466614,and why do you think you haven't done that?,because i didn't identify that as a problem.
016,016_166.txt,1,0.4248765707015991,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,"i could identify loneliness, boredom, i can identify feelings, but i can't identify issues such as hoarding, unable to move forward, and so forth."
016,016_167.txt,1,0.3783673346042633,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,i was then embarrassed to talk to a therapist i didn't know well.
016,016_167.txt,1,0.4006666839122772,okay.,"my most recent two therapists, i would have talked to, but two people back i was still working, so it wasn't a problem."
016,016_167.txt,1,0.4799048900604248,"okay, so CROSSTALK","i've alluded to it, but i've not said i want to talk about this."
016,016_167.txt,1,0.39874330163002014,so it goes back to familiarity and feelings of embarrassment?,yes.

016,016_168.txt,1,0.3263940215110779,"and this goes back to your most valuable items, so you're jewelry, your pottery, your art supplies, what would happen if you lost those?","well, i think that immediately i would feel profoundly sad and overwhelmed."
016,016_168.txt,1,0.3710233271121979,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE,and then rather quickly i would realize that things really don't matter in life.
016,016_169.txt,1,0.5097417831420898,so it would be CROSSTALK.,and that could go on.

016,016_169.txt,1,0.3467300832271576,"and then you would come to your logic and be like, it's the connections that matter and not the objects that represent those connections.",exactly.

017,017_177.txt,1,0.33556681871414185,okay.,"and my obsession with doing this has led me to make labels because my mother did that so that when i went through her house i found a little tiny rocking chair that i vaguely remember being around as a child, and on the bottom of it she had written that it was her chair as a child and the year, and i thought what a neat idea."

018,018_187.txt,1,0.4958466589450836,"okay. so, that was a place that you could put your stuff where you wouldn't have to see it, so you wouldn't have to feel anxious about going through it?","yeah, but because i also needed the space INAUDIBLE and had to clear a way, space in my apartment, and then..."

018,018_190.txt,1,0.4627543091773987,"so, an ideal apartment for you or an ideal living space would be more space than you have now, and it sounds like ideally, i would have this space to have everything laid out in an organized manner, in its proper place, and have all of your stuff-","yeah, and then i would also be able to reduce what i have because then i can see what i have too much of or what i don't need, and then i could either try to give it away or sell it or whatever."

018,018_191.txt,1,0.3673842251300812,"so, you're kind of working through the process of putting all of the most important things, getting a digital form of them, and then some of those things you don't need to save the original because you have a digital copy?","right, things that are new that aren't valuable."

018,018_192.txt,1,0.5722552537918091,"so, you have a different reason for keeping each thing?","yes, but then when things are all piled in one container, all miscellaneous, if each item has a different reason for being there, but yet there's too much of it, then there's the impulse to avoid it..."
018,018_192.txt,1,0.4787953794002533,because you'd have to think about-,... just because of all the work involved.
018,018_192.txt,1,0.39024364948272705,"right, because for each item you'd have to decide if you should keep it or not.",yeah.

018,018_192.txt,1,0.48027223348617554,that you particularly like to save older things?,yeah.
018,018_192.txt,1,0.5157131552696228,what is it about older things that you feel you should save?,"well, i guess the scarcity."
018,018_192.txt,1,0.5042888522148132,"so, something that's older, you might not be able to get it anymore?",right.
018,018_192.txt,1,0.47524216771125793,why do those need to be saved?,"i guess she's not too bad about that, but then there was a lot of way too many physical photographs that my mom had kept in the '80s and '90s, so these more recent ones, those i would really rather digitize, so once i've done that, i'll get rid of them-"
018,018_192.txt,1,0.3299507796764374,"so, those, because they're not as old-",... and then i've been now in the process of figuring out what equipment to use and when i'm going to do it.
018,018_192.txt,1,0.5791742205619812,"so, you intend to maybe get-","so, there's that."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.6193565726280212,"yeah. okay. the newer photographs you think you can get rid of after you digitize them, but the older photographs you're going to continue to hang onto?","once i've digitized them, once they're organized, then i would intend to find a niece or nephew to hand them off to, if they'll take them."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.38712945580482483,"so, you kind of plan to treat those, that organized collection, as an heirloom?","yeah, yeah."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.3674851655960083,"those are so important to you because they're linked to memories from your family, or-","well, yes, and also, the antique value for the things that are 100 years old."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.4844498038291931,"so, things that are older, you mean antique value in the sense of money value or sentimental value?",it's kind of a combination of both.
018,018_193.txt,1,0.6370039582252502,does that sound right?,"yeah, yeah."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.5619685053825378,"again, this is just hypothetical, but what do you think would happen if those things were lost?","well, i did wind up losing a lot of things recently, things of value, although they weren't necessarily the antique ones."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.24759317934513092,"but if they weren't digitized and you had lost them, you would be-",yeah.
018,018_193.txt,1,0.5051540732383728,it would make you anxious?,"for a while, i was afraid i had lost some film."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.3406476378440857,if you had lost-,... i'm at least trying to gather what i can for family history.
018,018_193.txt,1,0.31167107820510864,"so, if you had lost them before you digitized them, it would make you anxious that that part of your family history was lost?",right.
018,018_193.txt,1,0.42557352781295776,and you would feel regret that you were unable to preserve those parts of your family's memory?,"or something that could be of value, at least for me or someone else, and that has happened quite a bit."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.40628930926322937,"so, of value-","but i'd still wind up just dealing with it, letting it go anyway."
018,018_193.txt,1,0.31668588519096375,"so, you've learned to kind of deal a little bit with that loss, but you still worry about-","yeah, because-"
018,018_193.txt,1,0.4771968424320221,go ahead.,... there's still going to be things that are going to...

018,018_194.txt,1,0.35761699080467224,"when you talk about things that could be of value to you or your family, you mean they could be sentimentally of value, they could be important in the history of your family and in kind of the memories of your family, or they could be valuable in an objective sense because they're antiques?",yeah.
018,018_194.txt,1,0.5492678880691528,do you feel like right now you have too much stuff?,yes.
018,018_194.txt,1,0.4231148064136505,how do you know that the stuff that you have now is too much?,"well, the high cost of rent."
018,018_194.txt,1,0.5226691365242004,"if that wasn't an issue, if you had a bigger space where you could keep all of your stuff, would you keep it all, if the money wasn't an issue?","well, i would still try to keep things organized."
018,018_194.txt,1,0.4567306339740753,"so, if you didn't have to-","if i were able to organize it, then... i mean, if it was totally organized and it looked like everything was in the proper place, then i wouldn't necessarily consider that a hoard or clutter."
018,018_194.txt,1,0.5168495178222656,"so, organization is really the key for you.",yeah.
018,018_194.txt,1,0.5825234651565552,"so, if money wasn't an issue and you could get it all organized, you would keep everything, but in an organized way?","well, i still don't think i would want to keep everything because i would prefer to be able to hand off some things, as i found someone else who could use it."
018,018_194.txt,1,0.5372174382209778,is it that organization?,"well, yes, organization and livability."
018,018_194.txt,1,0.5047498941421509,it's about how organized the stuff is and whether or not it's in the way?,"well, it could also be the amount of things if later in life it's going to cause stress in order to deal with what to do with things."
018,018_194.txt,1,0.34538036584854126,"so, even if it was perfectly organized, if it was going to cause you stress to deal with it in the future, it would still be too much?",yeah.
018,018_195.txt,1,0.4024413824081421,"and those people, would you say that they have clutter problems or hoarding disorder?","no. however, one of them had mentioned that he would like to buy something really expensive because he would just like to have it."
018,018_195.txt,1,0.5061901807785034,"so, you see parallels?","so, for him it's the..."
018,018_195.txt,1,0.6305152177810669,"so, you can see that there's similarities.",yeah.
018,018_195.txt,1,0.3038480579853058,it's some people have a little bit of hoarding.,"right, whereas my sister is everything cut or dry, black or white, one extreme or the other, but to me, when you go from one extreme to the other, it's different sides of the same coin."
018,018_195.txt,1,0.5387282967567444,you might keep some things.,right.

018,018_195.txt,1,0.4936152994632721,"so, people have this very extreme view?",yeah.
018,018_195.txt,1,0.5283226370811462,"if you were to give somebody advice on how to deal with hoarding problems, what advice would you give them?","well, i guess i don't really advise people because that would..."
018,018_195.txt,1,0.6347384452819824,what do you think would help you?,i'm always needing to know where i can take some things.
018,018_196.txt,1,0.5428099632263184,"so, you would have an easier time getting organized if there was a place that you could drop things off?","yeah, if there was more things available."
018,018_196.txt,1,0.6346850395202637,"do you feel like what's stopping you from getting organized is not having enough space in your apartment, or is it not having enough time in your day, or is it your anxiety?","well, there's not having enough space or not having enough money to move to a bigger space."
018,018_196.txt,1,0.36660656332969666,"so, if you had a bigger space, then that would be helpful in helping you get organized?",yeah.
018,018_196.txt,1,0.3128671646118164,does it make you feel upset when you think about it?,"yeah, not being able to find a place that's affordable in a safe area."
018,018_196.txt,1,0.5615252256393433,does the problem of having too much stuff upset you?,"yeah, but i would feel better if i could have the space to get it all organized."

018,018_196.txt,1,0.34375032782554626,"does it impact your relationships, your friendships, or romantic relationships, or relationships with family?","well, i often would rather stay at home to go through things."

018,018_199.txt,1,0.5556986927986145,that was the questions that i have for you-,what is your gender?
019,019_200.txt,1,0.2327287644147873,"if we're asking people to think about their clutter problems as an issue that they should take up with their doctor, how is their doctor thinking about it and how are they thinking about it, and can we maybe use this research to help to understand how to bring those two groups of people together?",great.
019,019_200.txt,1,0.46811985969543457,how do you consider that for yourself?,"i regard myself as a longtime person who saves, and who is very, quite varied in my interest, my do-it-yourself interest."
019,019_200.txt,1,0.49603071808815,so we'll talk about you as a saver.,okay.
019,019_201.txt,1,0.6095126271247864,"so if you could just start by talking me through your saving, what it's like, how long it's been going on, when it started and then how it developed over time.","i have tried to touch a little bit so far, but i'd say that my perception is that my saving has been a longtime characteristic, probably started with the sense that scarcity or wastefulness is a sin."
019,019_201.txt,1,0.25289830565452576,"so it started when you were a kid with these values of resourcefulness and saving and not being wasteful, and then as you got older, you started to develop collections of different kinds of things, but the collections would never be ...","right, and the element of religion i think was part of this too."
019,019_201.txt,1,0.4078611433506012,"okay, can you talk about that and what you mean by it?","like i said, it was a sin to be wasteful."
019,019_201.txt,1,0.3914257884025574,"so it really sounds like there's a moral component to you, that it's a moral obligation to responsibly use things and not waste them.","i think so, yeah."
019,019_201.txt,1,0.31398963928222656,"instead, you're willing to hang onto them because you see the value in saving things and reusing them and being conscientious about them.",yes.
019,019_201.txt,1,0.49118703603744507,"sorry i interrupted your narrative, you were telling me about the record store and how it had changed throughout your life, and i interrupted you.","but i did make a collection of records and saved it in hopes that someday i would come to appreciate it and to have it release its value and enjoyment in my life, but without really being very realistic about it, because there's not enough time to do all the things i need to do."
019,019_201.txt,1,0.30017948150634766,that makes sense.,"i think one of the major parts of my life was that our house burned down, and i became a general contractor in rebuilding that house at the age of about 35 i think."
019,019_202.txt,1,0.41333529353141785,"so it was a defining moment for you to lose all of your possessions, what was that like for you as somebody who is a saver?",it did not bother me.
019,019_202.txt,1,0.33006975054740906,so you took on rebuilding the house yourself as a major part of your life.,"yeah, right."
019,019_202.txt,1,0.5199152231216431,so how did that contribute to the changes in your saving behavior?,it opened up other realms of areas that i needed to save for.
019,019_202.txt,1,0.40932345390319824,"so you started to save tools and things related to those jobs, to help you to be able to rebuild your home and to help you to do projects like that in the future.","and in a resourceful way, by not having other people coming and do it, but do it myself."
019,019_202.txt,1,0.4517460763454437,how would you say that your saving behavior is now?,"it's a challenge, because i've gotten to the age of 74 where i can no longer want to do those things, but i find that i haven't used the energy to just go through them and say, ""okay, i'll never use that, it's useless."""
019,019_202.txt,1,0.4066607654094696,"so some of the things you keep are related to usefulness, but also you keep things because they have sentimental value.",yes.
019,019_203.txt,1,0.7160475850105286,"would you say that it's severe, would you say it's under control?",i'd say it's certainly not under control.
019,019_203.txt,1,0.35778433084487915,"you mentioned the idea of selling your house, is that something that you're considering or that would be on the table for you?","it's not coming up right away, because we have too many things that we enjoy about where we are right now."
019,019_203.txt,1,0.44273310899734497,"so while neither of those things are immediate problems for you, you recognize that the behavior will be a problem in the future if you don't deal with it now.","right, right."

019,019_204.txt,1,0.6490805745124817,does that sound right?,yeah.
019,019_204.txt,1,0.3627941906452179,what do you like about it?,"the house that we rebuilt after the fire has many spaces, and of course, we also added on."
019,019_204.txt,1,0.7692295908927917,it sounds lovely.,it's a wonderful ...
019,019_204.txt,1,0.3769042193889618,that's great.,"so we've very happy with our lives right now, and our finances are very good with two pensions and social security."
019,019_204.txt,1,0.32702234387397766,"so you're secure and you sound like you are in a very idyllic location, and your home is exactly the way you and your wife designed it to be and built it to be.",right.
019,019_205.txt,1,0.44753944873809814,how does all of your saving fit into the space?,"okay, so the garage is my little area where i keep all my tools and all the different project history that i have, with the auto mechanics and gardening and bicycling and all the cleaning of bicycles, the storage of supplies, paints."
019,019_205.txt,1,0.328447163105011,"it's interesting, because you talk about your stuff and the clutter, but also it's so clear to me that you take such pride in the space and the maintenance of the space.",yes.
019,019_205.txt,1,0.3610488772392273,"are there areas, it sounds like your garage used to be cluttered and the clutter is creepy back.","yes, exactly."
019,019_205.txt,1,0.5121084451675415,are there places that you consider cluttered in your house?,"yeah, the garage is coming back, because it's still a controlled mess."
019,019_206.txt,1,0.6957136988639832,how about with papers and files?,"papers and files are in two locations, i have one, two, three, four, i have six file drawers."
019,019_206.txt,1,0.6668773293495178,pushing you to ...,she is pushing me and making my life better.
019,019_206.txt,1,0.3467886745929718,so you see the process of going through your stuff as an activity that you can do with and for your wife to improve your lives together as you age.,right.
019,019_206.txt,1,0.47561633586883545,"i love it, the organization as a loving activity is really nice.",mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
019,019_206.txt,1,0.40400430560112,which things would you have the hardest time giving up?,"i would say the projects that are currently active, which are things like my painting around the house, the gardening tools, the maintenance of the grounds, like my tractor and my lawn mower and the tools i use for dirt moving, wheelbarrow, things like that."
019,019_206.txt,1,0.4091305732727051,so most important possessions you have are the ones that you use the most.,yes.
019,019_206.txt,1,0.39373669028282166,"so would it be fair to say that when you think about all the things you save, the thing that makes them valuable is that they are useful, they are useful and used by you?",yes.
019,019_206.txt,1,0.32186445593833923,what was that process like for you?,"obviously, if it had aged into un-usability, meaning rusting or hardening of paint or things like that, that was an easy hit."
019,019_207.txt,1,0.5771046280860901,"so it's not simply a matter of you keeping things, it's a matter of, once you're not actively using them, they just stay wherever you last used them.","right, and i forget where i put that, because i'm moving onto something else."
019,019_207.txt,1,0.4911016821861267,"you seem very oriented towards tasks and their completion, and you get a lot of satisfaction out of that, and then once it's not useful to you in the moment anymore, it completely falls off your radar and it's not interesting to you.",and don't think about completing it to the point where i can find it next time i need it.
019,019_207.txt,1,0.5355076193809509,"so for you, discarding is also about the process of giving up those sorts of ambitions of one day completing those projects.","that's true, but i think the point i was trying to make, interviewer, was that even if something i know is necessary, still part of my active project possibilities, i don't honor the fact that i have disorganized something when using it."
019,019_207.txt,1,0.3325607478618622,"so it sounds like what you're saying is you're so oriented towards usefulness, but sometimes you undermine objects' usefulness by not organizing them and keeping them in a way that will make them optimally useful for you.","in the future, yeah."
019,019_207.txt,1,0.4518682360649109,that part of the process is just really difficult for you to notice.,maybe because i'm prone to take on too many things.
019,019_208.txt,1,0.3149528205394745,"so when you think about, i know that we talked earlier about the collection of records, when you think about normal saving or collecting, what do you think it is that sets hoarding behavior or over-saving apart from normal saving such as collecting?",you're asking a tough question here for me.
019,019_208.txt,1,0.41095831990242004,"so it's about realistic, having a realistic picture of your own limits, as much as anything else.",yeah.
019,019_208.txt,1,0.3524422347545624,"so it's about having a realistic view of what can be achieved and being able to say, ""okay, that might be a nice project for someone someday, but i don't think i'm going to actually be able to do that.""",yes.
019,019_209.txt,1,0.7593980431556702,what does hoarding disorder look like and how is it the same or different from your behavior?,"i think that i have clutter disorder, i don't think i have hoarding."
019,019_209.txt,1,0.5502628087997437,"then there's also this extreme compulsive behavior that you don't see in yourself, like the need for things.","let me make a point to you that i know of people who, in my life that i've come upon, who have hoarding and shopping."
019,019_209.txt,1,0.5745042562484741,"the way that you feel connected to the term hoarding disorder is by saving, and even then, it sounds like the kind of saving and the compulsive nature of it really doesn't fit with how you see yourself.","i think there is compulsion, and that is to save."
019,019_209.txt,1,0.49415531754493713,where do you get information about it or have you ever gotten information about it or heard anything about it as a disorder?,"no, i haven't."

019,019_209.txt,1,0.5546857118606567,where were you looking?,"i think on the internet, probably looked on the internet for hoarding."
020,020_210.txt,1,0.584457516670227,"we'll talk about it in terms of your clutter, because it sounds like you feel like you have done a good job in dealing with things, such that it doesn't sound like you think that you have hoarding right now.","well, i think i have, in the sense that i have a lot of things that i don't need."
020,020_210.txt,1,0.43041396141052246,"so maybe you're not acquiring stuff, but you still have problems with keeping stuff.",right.
020,020_211.txt,1,0.4478554427623749,it sounds like there's a conflict between what you find comfortable and the aesthetic that you'd like to have your house be in-,yes.
020,020_211.txt,1,0.5313321352005005,what is feeling at home like for you?,i think it does.
020,020_211.txt,1,0.34797579050064087,is there a reason that you don't-,"i think what it is is that even if i like, aesthetically, the less cluttered places, i'm not used to spending time in them, so i'm having to really look at saying how do i... can i, once i get these photographs out of the way, will i be able to actually go in there and use the living room as a place to read or listen to music or listen to the radio, all the things that i do in my bedroom that is very cluttered?"
020,020_212.txt,1,0.3856256306171417,"it's interesting,"" and then it also sounds like you're recognizing or you recognized in that moment maybe a more unconscious process-",right.

020,020_212.txt,1,0.663607656955719,so it's-,and i think-
020,020_212.txt,1,0.7053627967834473,go ahead.,yeah.
020,020_212.txt,1,0.4481283128261566,it sounds like you used to do more purchasing behavior before you had the realization that-,right.
020,020_212.txt,1,0.24327901005744934,does that sound right?,"i think it was more that i was drawn to the aesthetics of it, and what i wasn't aware of at that time was the psychological impact of advertising and stuff like that on people."
020,020_212.txt,1,0.3592251241207123,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,but other people are more able to get rid of things when they get something new.
020,020_212.txt,1,0.39888450503349304,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,i'm feeling much less concerned now with getting new things to replace my old things than i used to be.
020,020_213.txt,1,0.36294427514076233,"so you've kind of dealt pretty successfully with the acquiring, and you definitely-",i think CROSSTALK

020,020_214.txt,1,0.3312889337539673,yeah.,"if you watch somebody dealing with giveaways or trash or flea markets, where i'm sure you get a lot of that in people who go to flea markets."

020,020_215.txt,1,0.4657380282878876,"for the last list i'd like to make with you, i'd like you to list for me all of the reasons that you think someone might want to seek treatment for hoarding problems.","well, the first one that would come to my mind for myself is wanting to be able to overcome a lot of shyness and at least have a place where i might feel okay inviting somebody into the house."

024,024_270.txt,1,0.3450479209423065,but over time you've kind of accumulated more and more stuff from the various people in your life.,that's right.
024,024_270.txt,1,0.4528765082359314,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,and antiques too.

024,024_270.txt,1,0.3064410090446472,so it sounds like you always had the tendency to keep things because you had so many interests.,that's right.
024,024_271.txt,1,0.5881033539772034,and then you get more.,that's right.

024,024_273.txt,1,0.6408977508544922,so that's interesting because you said the computer room is one of the most cluttered places and the-,"yeah, because that's where the computer is."
024,024_273.txt,1,0.43153899908065796,so that's where you put all your stuff that you're working on.,yes.

024,024_273.txt,1,0.3778081238269806,so it s-,"which at one time, let's say at one time i was interested in teddy bears and i learned how to make teddy bears."
024,024_273.txt,1,0.6567820310592651,that totally makes sense.,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
024,024_273.txt,1,0.3077925741672516,"and then you also have all of the items that you have to do all of the activities, which are interesting to you or that you might need to do in that room.",correct.

024,024_274.txt,1,0.5074342489242554,"so when you say tidy, you mean like everything in its proper place?","yeah, because i keep a lot of things."
024,024_274.txt,1,0.560511589050293,and you would have a clear counter.,yes.

024,024_276.txt,1,0.43006381392478943,so you were looking for the ones that were the most potentially useful?,correct.
024,024_276.txt,1,0.4480893313884735,"and so when you go through those things, if you were to clean up those spaces, how would you decide which of those things to keep?","well, i remember telling you toward the end of the last week, that when i go through the emotional things, what i do is i may take, let's say there's 10 emotional items."
024,024_276.txt,1,0.3491334021091461,"so you can get rid of some of those things, but not all of them, and you end up just moving around?",that's right.

024,024_276.txt,1,0.51781165599823,that's one way of thinking about it.,"and since i live in earthquake country, that could come up too."
024,024_277.txt,1,0.582241415977478,it's hard to pick which things would you would take?,pardon me?
024,024_277.txt,1,0.6625185012817383,it's hard because there's so much that you'd like to take or it's hard because-,"no, it's just because i have to think about so many things."
024,024_277.txt,1,0.6334105134010315,"maybe another way of thinking about it is what do you think you'd miss the most, if you didn't have it all?","that's hard to think about too, because everything except me and my dogs and some antiques i could live without, or i could replace."
024,024_277.txt,1,0.4436933994293213,because it was your mother's.,say that again INAUDIBLE.
024,024_277.txt,1,0.490186482667923,is it because it's valuable in terms of money and you could sell it?,yes.
024,024_277.txt,1,0.5791667103767395,so it's got both of those kinds of value?,yes.
024,024_277.txt,1,0.8027238845825195,it's a hard question.,that's a very good question.
024,024_277.txt,1,0.5508326888084412,"so, you'd want the information rom the computer?",yes.
024,024_277.txt,1,0.3801303505897522,"so if you think about all the very cluttered spaces in your house, so your computer room, the back bedroom and the garage, do you feel like there's stuff in there that's trash?",not really.
024,024_278.txt,1,0.4369158446788788,"when you look at your stuff and you say, ""i can throw that out, that's trash.""","now, that depends."

024,024_278.txt,1,0.462691992521286,have you ever thought about getting help with your problems with clutter?,"oh, yes."
024,024_278.txt,1,0.5432753562927246,at your church.,yeah.
024,024_278.txt,1,0.45125624537467957,but that didn't seem like it helped you.,"but interestingly enough, none of us wanted somebody else to go through our stuff."
024,024_278.txt,1,0.4930672347545624,everybody's private about their own stuff.,yes.
024,024_278.txt,1,0.49371370673179626,or have you ever sought that about going to a professional organizer or somebody like that?,"i know that's available, but i don't think that's something i would turn to."
024,024_278.txt,1,0.4934368133544922,how come?,"number one, i wouldn't want to pay for it."
024,024_279.txt,1,0.46491825580596924,what do you think that would be like?,"well, i like books."
024,024_279.txt,1,0.3859574794769287,the problem is just having the time and energy to do the task of getting through organizing all of it.,"well, that's only recently."
024,024_279.txt,1,0.48369356989860535,what you need is to just have the time and energy to focus on doing it.,at this point.
024,024_279.txt,1,0.3998774290084839,"and the desire, it sounds like it's not your priority.","even all the way along, i think so."
024,024_279.txt,1,0.3838828206062317,"maybe somebody who collects things or somebody who just has a lot of stuff, and somebody who has a problem with saving, like a clutter problem or hoarding disorder.","well, when you say that, i think in my case, it depends on what it is."
024,024_280.txt,1,0.3091498017311096,"and so for example, with your hallmark ornaments, you could give those away, because even though you collected them, you're not attached to them.",that's correct.
024,024_280.txt,1,0.38159751892089844,is that because you collected them with your husband and there are memories attached to acquiring them?,yes.
024,024_280.txt,1,0.31542375683784485,so do you feel like you are-,"although some things ... well, you see, i collected those, but i never did anything with them."
024,024_280.txt,1,0.667515754699707,that makes sense.,and that's true of several things actually.
024,024_280.txt,1,0.4732534885406494,and that makes it-,"yeah, they're of no use."
024,024_280.txt,1,0.38299673795700073,"so kind of having things that you don't use or even look at, that's where it-","yeah, but i know that they're there."
025,025_282.txt,1,0.5089066028594971,"talking about your behavior, can you please describe your hoarding or problems with clutter?","well, like i said before, my closets are filled."
025,025_282.txt,1,0.4262692332267761,"it sounds like your home is still, you're able to use it as your home space and it's not like the clutter is preventing you from moving around any spaces.","no, no it's not."
025,025_282.txt,1,0.6927745342254639,"you seem to keep the items contained to spaces pre-determined for storage, except for you mentioned your bathroom.",well in the cabinets in the bathroom.
025,025_283.txt,1,0.4960062503814697,"do you think that the space, the bedroom, would be filled if you hadn't just moved, or is this part of the moving process for you, just putting everything that wasn't unpacked yet in that space?","well, if i had a place to put it, i mean the reality is i probably need to get rid of some of it, but some of it is stuff i don't want to get rid of."
025,025_283.txt,1,0.42414841055870056,has this ever caused any problems with family or friends?,"well, with my husband, i mean we've just been married for five years."
025,025_284.txt,1,0.45229145884513855,do you feel that the saving and acquiring new items and having an accumulation of items is a problem for you?,yeah.

025,025_284.txt,1,0.9146659970283508,yeah.,well yeah.
025,025_284.txt,1,0.5291659235954285,"will that be something that you wear or any other kind of item, maybe not clothing or jewelry?",how do i decide when to get rid of it?
025,025_284.txt,1,0.5078263878822327,yeah.,"if it's broken i'll get rid of it, or if i'm tired of it."
025,025_285.txt,1,0.33099615573883057,"having the ability to donate the item rather than just simply discard it and know it'll end up in a landfill, that makes it easier to give up the item in a way?",yes.
025,025_285.txt,1,0.35007449984550476,especially if there's going to be waste that goes into producing a new item of the same exact quality that you purchased anyways.,"yeah, yes."
025,025_285.txt,1,0.4280814826488495,is it because maybe you've bought some new clothes and you need to make space for them so you start to think about what things you can get rid of?,"that's one of them, yeah."
025,025_286.txt,1,0.4634735584259033,yeah.,i tend to have piles of paper.
025,025_286.txt,1,0.35310277342796326,"yeah, which can be hard because you don't necessarily know when you'll need an item.","that's right, yep."
025,025_286.txt,1,0.5897055864334106,do you have any items that are very precious to you for sentimental reasons?,"oh yeah, like the stuff i have from my mother, like photos."
025,025_286.txt,1,0.5877419710159302,"yeah, to go through.",it's overwhelming.
025,025_287.txt,1,0.6263763308525085,yeah.,i have been thinking along those lines.
025,025_287.txt,1,0.56446373462677,that was-,CROSSTALK yeah.
025,025_287.txt,1,0.40318572521209717,it's interesting how so much value is dependent on who has the item.,"yep, yep."
025,025_287.txt,1,0.6080434918403625,"do you have any items, or any one item that you consider to be most precious to you?",one item.
025,025_287.txt,1,0.4425542652606964,is there any group of items?,"well i have some of my mother's jewelry, so that would be precious."
025,025_287.txt,1,0.5528470277786255,"what do you feel then, when you think about possibly losing that item?","just maybe sadness, because it's a reminder to me of my grandmother."
025,025_288.txt,1,0.3160339593887329,"in a way, i don't know if this thought has ever occurred to you before, but looking at the item and if it's something that's useful to you, knowing that you kept the item in the family for both sentimental reasons and also it serves a purpose, so everything around you can provide comfort in a way, because you know that it's reducing waste, as well as has meaning.",yeah.
025,025_288.txt,1,0.4935820996761322,"it sounds like whenever you think about discarding items it doesn't cause you any extreme amount of stress or anxiety when thinking about getting rid of items, it's just more it's something that you have to actually think of to do.","it's hard for me to make that dent, but once i do i always feel free."
025,025_288.txt,1,0.520516037940979,what makes it difficult to do that in the first place?,i'm always second guessing.
025,025_288.txt,1,0.3328845202922821,"it doesn't link to anything external, like worrying about the environmental repercussions, it's more just knowing that an item that was useful to you still has value.",yeah.
025,025_288.txt,1,0.6891737580299377,that's interesting.,"it's crazy, i know."
025,025_288.txt,1,0.4399753510951996,i've had to move almost every year being in the college age.,oh yeah.
025,025_289.txt,1,0.3763974606990814,"like you said, if you don't actively think about discarding items you continue to accumulate.","yep, yeah."
025,025_289.txt,1,0.45422032475471497,"when did you start thinking in that manner, and what made you aware of thinking of discarding in addition to getting new items?",i think when i had to downsize my mother and bring all of her stuff under my roof.
025,025_289.txt,1,0.2753497064113617,okay so it's mainly the thinking of burdening others with it that's ...,"right, yeah."
025,025_289.txt,1,0.378423273563385,"it really doesn't click until you do it for someone else when you realize, ""wow someone will probably be doing this one day for me.""","yeah, yeah."
025,025_289.txt,1,0.4276930093765259,how long ago was this?,"well my mother, like in 2012, maybe eight years ago when i actually did that, when i went up there and spent a week decluttering her apartment."
025,025_290.txt,1,0.658400297164917,"it compounds, yeah.",mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
025,025_290.txt,1,0.5266441702842712,"i know that can be very difficult, going through all that.",thank you.
025,025_290.txt,1,0.511593759059906,"i was about to say, i don't think it got much better.",i know.
025,025_290.txt,1,0.6593918204307556,yeah different way.,"yeah, yeah."
025,025_291.txt,1,0.43495506048202515,when do you think you first started to accumulate items above what other people were?,it was after college because that's when i got married.
025,025_291.txt,1,0.48917630314826965,"mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE because you could, it was your space.",right.
025,025_291.txt,1,0.36223480105400085,yeah it was the fact that you had the space and there was nothing really stopping you at that point from doing it.,"yeah, but now there's someone else in the house and we have other things to spend our money on, that's the other thing."
025,025_291.txt,1,0.32549968361854553,"yeah it's something that's new, well newer, and certainly has been happening for a shorter timeframe than the other thought of just no need to discard when acquiring a new item because there was space and there were different priorities at that point.",yep.
025,025_292.txt,1,0.4225977659225464,do you think there's any difference between normal collecting items and hoarding?,"you know, i don't know what the correct answer is."
025,025_292.txt,1,0.5679717659950256,there's no correct answer.,i would think yeah there would be a difference.
025,025_292.txt,1,0.34574946761131287,it seems to be a level of organization might be what distinguishes it.,"that and, i mean with me it's not anything in particular, i just like to enjoy life and i like to have pretty things."
025,025_292.txt,1,0.4961048364639282,"yeah, that's very clear.",i'm sorry i have an allergy CROSSTALK
025,025_292.txt,1,0.6050416827201843,are you okay?,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
025,025_292.txt,1,0.6590164303779602,"is it mainly from tv, online?","yeah it's mostly, i've seen that show about hoarders and just random things online."
025,025_292.txt,1,0.4791252911090851,have you seen any changes in your acquiring during this time?,oh yeah.
025,025_292.txt,1,0.43336760997772217,has there been any renewed energy or interest in cleaning out and donating or discarding items?,"yes, but that comes in waves, it's not an everyday thing."
025,025_292.txt,1,0.44730719923973083,yeah.,"yeah, so i have to figure out what i'm going to do with it, but i did go through some of it from time to time, and i did get rid of stuff."
025,025_292.txt,1,0.4760913848876953,"has it gotten easier to think about getting rid of items, or to kind of think, ""oh yeah i may not need that,"" or to-","yeah i'm getting better as i get older, because i know none of it goes with us when we leave this world."
025,025_293.txt,1,0.6829537153244019,"is this something, like a mentality that you've acquired you think with getting older, or has this especially happened over this period where you are unable to see as many people?","no, no, no. this is something that comes with maturity, i believe."
025,025_293.txt,1,0.8163667321205139,okay.,yeah.
025,025_293.txt,1,0.4194428324699402,how are you doing since about mid march with your physical health?,"well i put on a few extra pounds, but otherwise, a little depressed, if you want to know the real truth, a little bit depressed, because i'm a people person and i like social interaction, so it's difficult to be isolated."
025,025_293.txt,1,0.5422529578208923,has that been an extra stressor?,"yeah, it has."
025,025_293.txt,1,0.6408836841583252,i know that can be rough.,yeah.
025,025_293.txt,1,0.3848244547843933,"do you feel like it was almost helpful, in a way, to have to find a job in order to interact with people?",yeah.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.45434507727622986,"this has been very, very different than what we're used to.",yeah.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.45079144835472107,what have you been doing to cope with the more depressed mood and the isolation?,"well we talk, i talk to my husband and i have my good and bad days."
025,025_294.txt,1,0.3808836042881012,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"i know that god is in control, so i rely on my faith more than anything to get me through the dark days."
025,025_294.txt,1,0.6043588519096375,do you feel it's been helping so far?,yeah it does when i do it.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.5091063380241394,it is hard-,"it's an escape, so i like to sleep."
025,025_294.txt,1,0.3674062192440033,"have the items that you have also helped bring comfort, or is primarily your loved ones, so having your husband around?",it's probably all of it.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.3445003628730774,"that kind of ties back to, that was something you mentioned in the first place, was whenever you have the items you always know that you have that security, that if you need something it's there, so why would you discard it in that place.",yeah.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.49269571900367737,have you ever felt that you needed that?,say that again.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.45025861263275146,have you ever felt that you needed professional-,"no, nope."
025,025_294.txt,1,0.42954930663108826,did you feel any sort of this social isolation or loneliness prior to the quarantine?,"no, because i could go out and be around people at will."
025,025_294.txt,1,0.4928434193134308,"yes, which is something hopefully we'll get back to in the next year.","yeah, without a mask hopefully."
025,025_294.txt,1,0.5830458998680115,you don't like seeing everyone's eyes?,we all look like bank robbers.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.46328288316726685,"a little bit, yes.",you can't smile at someone.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.44627803564071655,"yeah, they do.",CROSSTALK our facial expression.
025,025_294.txt,1,0.439217209815979,"it's made interacting, even when you do get the chance, it's just very different and it feels sterile in a way, almost.","yeah it is, ridiculous."
025,025_294.txt,1,0.38271382451057434,have your items affected your relationship with your husband?,no. i mean we just have the normal type of stress that probably everybody does with something like this.
025,025_295.txt,1,0.5133204460144043,it's impacting every avenue of life.,yeah.
025,025_295.txt,1,0.4949955344200134,yeah it's impacted everything.,yep.
025,025_295.txt,1,0.46871936321258545,"do you feel that there's anything more you want to discuss, or any questions you have?",no. no i really don't.
025,025_295.txt,1,0.5861728191375732,"well i hope i didn't bother you, or talk your ear off.","no, no that was fine."
026,026_296.txt,1,0.408815860748291,"and i would just like to start by having you tell me a little bit about your experience with clutter problems, when it started and how it went on and what it's like for you now?",okay.
026,026_296.txt,1,0.4757192134857178,definitely.,so things just kind of piled up.
026,026_296.txt,1,0.4692770838737488,"so with you, this problem was kind of related to being a parent?",right.
026,026_296.txt,1,0.4374908208847046,and you didn't find that prior to having children you had any problems with getting rid of things at all?,"no, thinking back, not really."
026,026_296.txt,1,0.4065569341182709,wow.,"and so my vision was somewhat compromised, so it's a little harder for me to read and focus."
026,026_296.txt,1,0.2960253059864044,"and then at the same time you had this problem with your eyesight, so it was harder for you to go through papers, and you kept meaning to go through them and then not being able to because of the differences, changes in your vision.",right.
026,026_296.txt,1,0.5500190854072571,"how is the behavior now as compared to when it began, do you feel like it's gotten worse over time or it's pretty much been the same the whole time?",it's better.
026,026_297.txt,1,0.3676638603210449,so you've dealt with it mainly by stopping yourself from getting new items?,yeah.
026,026_297.txt,1,0.37776321172714233,and that's been successful for you but you still just don't feel ready to go through the stuff that you have because it's such a big task.,"yeah, right."
026,026_297.txt,1,0.6826432347297668,does that sound right?,"right, right."
026,026_297.txt,1,0.46353447437286377,so it sounds like you're aware that you wouldn't necessarily miss it once it was gone?,"oh right, yeah."
026,026_297.txt,1,0.3256630003452301,"sure, but i also understand that once you look at those things you feel the sentiment that's attached to them, and it becomes hard to just get rid of them even though you know that you're not using them.","right, right."
026,026_297.txt,1,0.3697810173034668,so it helps you to get rid of them when you know that they're going somewhere where they'll be used?,right.
026,026_297.txt,1,0.39447593688964844,"yeah, so you're kind of waiting, or you feel like you would feel better about it if you knew for a fact that it was the right place for those items?","exactly, exactly."
026,026_297.txt,1,0.45733964443206787,what is your home like and does it bother you to have these items?,"yeah, there are still pockets of clutter and that bothers me, but i keep thinking down the road i'll just commit half an hour a day and i'll go through with it."
026,026_297.txt,1,0.41786205768585205,so it sounds like you have made some attempts in the past to get rid of your clutter but right now it's not your priority?,right.
026,026_297.txt,1,0.41185030341148376,had you ever gone to a professional to help you organize or to help you to kind of come to terms with your clutter?,"no, i don't like people touching my stuff."
026,026_297.txt,1,0.5388943552970886,"i understand that, yeah.","or making judgements, i know what i have to do, i just need to take that step."
026,026_298.txt,1,0.33268603682518005,"right, so you don't feel like you would benefit from somebody helping you to do it because it's not a hard task, you just haven't been ready to do it yet?",right.
026,026_298.txt,1,0.38530537486076355,yeah.,"right, i've got that emotional attachment and nobody's going to help me with that."
026,026_298.txt,1,0.5131576657295227,"how about your family and friends, what's the reaction to this from your daughters, from your husband, from other people?",my kids don't even notice.
026,026_298.txt,1,0.5003074407577515,"so they make comments, teasing.",pardon?
026,026_298.txt,1,0.5061962008476257,"they'll make comments, just kind of teasing?","oh yeah, we have that kind of relationship."
026,026_298.txt,1,0.7450981140136719,he's mostly bothered by it out of all of the people in your life?,"he's very bothered by it, yeah."
026,026_298.txt,1,0.5381148457527161,and you said it's very neat and organized so it's all put away in boxes and out of sight?,"a lot yeah, in the basement there's a lot of stuff, there's some stuff in the attic."
026,026_298.txt,1,0.31574156880378723,yeah.,"well my desk is in the family room, so i've got a lot of papers on the desk and i brought in a folding table and put more papers on that folding table and then there was shelves there with toys and books that the kids no longer use."
026,026_298.txt,1,0.5034060478210449,so what space in your home is the space that either you spend the most time in or that you like to spend time in the most?,"well the kitchen just because, well because."
026,026_298.txt,1,0.578306257724762,what would you like that room to look like?,"i would like it to only have the furniture that i need which i pretty much do, and no clutter."
026,026_299.txt,1,0.43871596455574036,so you would like it to just be the same room but just with all of the clutter completely gone?,"right, right."
026,026_299.txt,1,0.4341517388820648,are there any items that you consider clutter that you would keep?,no-
026,026_299.txt,1,0.521440863609314,i guess i'm wondering are any of the items important to you or that you like but maybe not in the right place right now?,"no, those kinds of things i don't have a problem dealing with if i like them."
026,026_299.txt,1,0.4530845880508423,and ideally you would just like all of that stuff to be gone?,yeah.
026,026_299.txt,1,0.6104986071586609,"do you feel like those items are important for you feeling at home, or ideally they would just be gone and you don't really need them in your home space?",i think what's relevant i would like to have.
026,026_299.txt,1,0.5028508305549622,"so you're not attached to that at all, you would just like to eliminate it?","i would, but i just can't seem to get to it."
026,026_299.txt,1,0.5211490392684937,"so we've talked a little bit about being sentimentally attached to items, and i guess thinking about all of the things in your home, which ones are the most important to you, which ones do you value?",which items?
026,026_299.txt,1,0.5283626317977905,yeah.,if i had to replace everything i would be okay.
026,026_299.txt,1,0.5825130343437195,are there items like that that you feel very attached to?,you know what?
026,026_299.txt,1,0.3349560499191284,it will save you the task of having to-,"absolutely yeah, because sometimes i've gone through stuff in the basement and papers and things have gotten kind of moldy and falling apart."
026,026_299.txt,1,0.7008916735649109,"yeah it's gone, yeah.",yeah.
026,026_299.txt,1,0.5976967811584473,how do you decide when it's time to just toss it?,you mean going forward or with these things that have accumulated?
026,026_300.txt,1,0.5844190716743469,"yeah, when you look at let's say, the folding table in your family room and you look at the papers that are on it and you pick one up, how would you know if it was something you needed to keep and save and go through or if it was something that you could just put straight in the trash?","all of it truthfully, can go in the trash, but i just feel this compulsion to read what's there, and i don't mean cover to cover just kind of scanning and seeing if i missed anything."
026,026_300.txt,1,0.3304218351840973,"so you recognize that you're not necessarily going to read every word but when you pick it up even though you know you don't need to save it, you like to just look through it and to make sure that there's not information there that you could use?","that's a big part of it, yeah."
026,026_300.txt,1,0.5088755488395691,"so it's true curiosity, you're actually interested in whatever is on there?",yeah it's a form of entertainment i would say.
026,026_300.txt,1,0.4034416079521179,"but then when the paper gets moldy or damaged in some way then you're totally fine with not even looking at it, just tossing it in the trash?",exactly.
026,026_300.txt,1,0.6282173991203308,"so when you think about hoarding disorder, how would you distinguish somebody who has a problem with saving, like in hoarding disorder from somebody who has more normal saving behavior like maybe somebody who has a collection?",i would say the hoarding is more of an irrational thing.
026,026_300.txt,1,0.4985106289386749,"so in hoarding disorder as opposed to collecting, there's not really that rational cognition behind it, it's all just a kind of impulse.","right, and i think with collecting there's an element of pleasure there."
026,026_300.txt,1,0.22893045842647552,so people who have hoarding disorder don't take pleasure in the same way as a collector in their items?,"right, right."
026,026_300.txt,1,0.38690587878227234,they just have to save them even if they might not want them.,exactly.
026,026_300.txt,1,0.743533730506897,yeah.,"right, right, right."
026,026_300.txt,1,0.4084109961986542,"so you said you had experience in this with your grandmother, could you describe what you feel like hoarding disorder looks like and how you know when somebody has it?",well you mean in her case?
026,026_300.txt,1,0.30086442828178406,"in any case, yeah, or wherever you have experience with it?","well in her case, she would take things, like maybe she'd rip a piece off of say, a cereal box and put it under the bed."
026,026_301.txt,1,0.4747624099254608,so she just had certain items that she couldn't help but saving?,"right, and they had no meaning at all, but in her mind there was some rhyme or reason to it all."
026,026_301.txt,1,0.3902343511581421,so there were just certain things she had to hang on to.,yeah.
026,026_301.txt,1,0.6292083263397217,"so when you think about this disorder, do you think that you could tell somebody had it if you weren't able to look at their stuff?","just by looking at the person, or knowing the person?"
026,026_301.txt,1,0.5017445683479309,yeah if you met somebody.,"no, i wouldn't."
026,026_301.txt,1,0.40056848526000977,are there people in your life that you know have these sorts of problems or that you suspect have even just problems with clutter?,my sister does big time actually.
026,026_301.txt,1,0.47626441717147827,"and how do you know that she has that problem, have you talked about it with her or is it from seeing her home?","no, when we've talked about it she'd say, ""i'm so busy, i work and have kids, i can't deal with it."""
026,026_301.txt,1,0.42642509937286377,so you see this problem in her from looking at her stuff and being in her home?,yeah.
026,026_301.txt,1,0.41588544845581055,"and she recognizes it but she just is busy and has other things in her life that she's working on, does that sound right?","right, and also i believe she was diagnosed with dyslexia and add in college."
026,026_301.txt,1,0.3808770775794983,so you think that that plays into her problem with keeping things?,i'm sorry?
026,026_301.txt,1,0.5429092049598694,do you think that the dyslexia plays in to her cluttering problems?,"i think so, because even talking to her she pivots on a dime, goes off on tangents and doesn't even finish the sentence, in the middle of a sentence she'll start a new thought."
026,026_302.txt,1,0.4114269018173218,"sure, so she's just a little scattered in her personality?","yeah, very much so."
026,026_302.txt,1,0.5229630470275879,or have you ever read about it or seen anything about it anywhere?,"yeah, i would say my earliest experience was my grandmother, but over the years i've seen lots of stuff about it in different places."
026,026_302.txt,1,0.3528043031692505,so i'm going to read you a couple of vignettes here and then we're going to close out the section of the interview where we're going to talk about hoarding disorder and we're going to get back to talking about your life.,okay.
026,026_302.txt,1,0.3521166443824768,"and again, this is just to try to understand the way people who have problems with clutter but maybe don't have hoarding disorder understand the disorder and understand what it is and what it isn't.",okay.
026,026_302.txt,1,0.4068947732448578,"so i'll read you a little vignette about a person and then you can tell me if you think that this person has hoarding disorder or maybe just has clutter problems or maybe doesn't even have clutter problems, it's up to you.",okay.
026,026_302.txt,1,0.3613813817501068,and we can talk about why they may or may not have the disorder.,okay.
026,026_302.txt,1,0.5041379332542419,and why not?,because the boxes are contained in one area.
026,026_302.txt,1,0.42463529109954834,because his house is really not that effected?,"right, and also he's saving specific items for a reason, i do that too."
026,026_302.txt,1,0.4661614000797272,do you think he should try to change his behavior or do you think that he should work on this problem?,"i don't think so, i didn't hear that there was a problem."
026,026_303.txt,1,0.4043373763561249,so it's just a thing that he does that doesn't really in the way of his life?,i think so.
026,026_303.txt,1,0.6225754022598267,do you feel like this person's behavior is similar to yours or different from yours?,somewhat similar.
026,026_303.txt,1,0.5545572638511658,do you feel like this is a person with hoarding disorder?,yes.
026,026_303.txt,1,0.33037158846855164,and what makes the difference for you?,"the fact that every room has boxes, that she has to move things out of the way when she enters the room and that she has trouble on a regular basis finding things."
026,026_303.txt,1,0.46588045358657837,so all of those things are signs that this is more of a problem?,"right, it's negatively impacting her life."
026,026_303.txt,1,0.451592355966568,so should she try to change her behavior?,yes.
026,026_303.txt,1,0.6416175961494446,and what do you think she should do to try to change her behavior?,she probably should be in therapy.
026,026_303.txt,1,0.446256160736084,"okay, so maybe this is a person who needs help from a psychiatrist or a psychologist to deal with this problem?",i would say so.
026,026_303.txt,1,0.5333274602890015,and do you feel like this person's behavior is similar to or different from your behavior?,different.
026,026_303.txt,1,0.376757949590683,and what's the difference?,"the difference is that i don't have an excess of items in every room, i don't need to move things around in order to get around, and it's not really impacting my life."
026,026_303.txt,1,0.42673078179359436,"okay so for the final vignette i'd like to read you, and then we'll get back to talking, we'll get the last section of the interview.",yeah.
026,026_304.txt,1,0.5363253355026245,so do you think that this is a person with hoarding disorder?,i think so.
026,026_304.txt,1,0.3177871108055115,"and why, what makes the difference?","because she feels the need to accumulate antiques whether or not she needs them, it sounds like she doesn't have room for them and it sounds like she has more than she can handle so it's cluttering her life and her mind."
026,026_304.txt,1,0.4524608254432678,so it doesn't matter to you in this case that one person is saving boxes and the other person is saving valuable antiques?,not really.
026,026_304.txt,1,0.5231359004974365,it sounds like the difference is that-,i think it's effecting them the same way.
026,026_304.txt,1,0.48549726605415344,so the similarity is the effect on their life?,"i think so, yeah."
026,026_304.txt,1,0.4033605456352234,"so thinking specifically about the last couple of months, which has effected everybody, do you feel like it has effected your life at all in terms of clutter to have had this experience with covid-19?",yes.
026,026_304.txt,1,0.3558129370212555,in which way?,"i've gotten rid of some of the clutter, because i'm spending more time at home and i have more time to deal with it."
026,026_304.txt,1,0.5170016288757324,so you've actually been able to de-clutter because you have the time to organize?,"right, and then my kids came back home for about four months, and so i had the incentive to keeps things neat."
026,026_304.txt,1,0.3575240671634674,so the presence of your children in your home has made you need to keep your home more organized.,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
026,026_304.txt,1,0.5030015110969543,"has it effected your acquiring of items or of news or magazines or papers, has it impacted that at all, have you been acquiring more or fewer new things?","well we canceled our newspaper delivery, so that was a big step."
026,026_304.txt,1,0.9999987483024597,because of covid?,because of covid?
026,026_304.txt,1,0.5427042841911316,you canceled it because you just didn't want the paper anymore?,right.
026,026_305.txt,1,0.38334518671035767,"do you feel, go ahead?",i guess i'm really not buying very much except for food.
026,026_305.txt,1,0.29709842801094055,"so you've done less shopping, you've gone out less, and you've more just kind of stayed home and had more time to organize and keep the house set up the way you'd like it?",yeah.
026,026_305.txt,1,0.5100489258766174,has covid-19 effected your physical health at all in this time?,"no, not in a negative way."
026,026_305.txt,1,0.2790050804615021,"oh, wonderful.",i haven't swum regularly since before my daughter was born in 1992.
026,026_305.txt,1,0.6509218215942383,"that's wonderful, that's great, i'm glad to hear that.",yeah.
026,026_305.txt,1,0.4803105294704437,"how about in terms of your mental health or your overall wellbeing, do you feel like you've been effected by covid in that way?",well the whole situation really disturbs me.

026,026_305.txt,1,0.4218229651451111,that makes sense.,a lot of the external pressures are gone.
026,026_305.txt,1,0.3164934813976288,"so while you feel stress surrounding news and current events, in terms of your world and your day to day life it's made things simpler and easier, does that sound right?","oh yes, very much so."
026,026_305.txt,1,0.45602521300315857,have there been financial impacts on you or on your family?,"actually yes, my husband is self employed and he works with corporate executives doing media training."
026,026_305.txt,1,0.44475045800209045,that makes sense.,"he's doing some things on zoom, but yeah that's been a concern."
026,026_305.txt,1,0.409434974193573,"so there has been an impact it sounds like, just in terms of his business?",yeah.

027,027_321.txt,1,0.5062470436096191,are there any other places where you get information about hoarding disorder or where you've gotten information about hoarding disorder before?,"i did google it a couple of times, more out of curiosity, but no, pretty much, the tv shows."
027,027_321.txt,1,0.4561915993690491,"what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder, if it's anything different?","i think i want to go to their houses, see what they have."
027,027_321.txt,1,0.6157732009887695,it was interesting?,yes.
027,027_321.txt,1,0.47103533148765564,does your hoarding ever get in the way of your daily life?,"no, not at all."
027,027_322.txt,1,0.44542545080184937,"i know we talked about your children and their spouses, but any romantic relationships or friendships?","definitely not, no."
027,027_322.txt,1,0.5435694456100464,never interfered with anything like work?,"no, definitely not."
027,027_322.txt,1,0.39791345596313477,is that correct?,"yeah, the only thing that i would like to do is to find buyers for the stuff in my ebay, craigslist room."
027,027_322.txt,1,0.390616774559021,oh wow.,"now, he did take 40% for his profit, but very happy that somebody got it that knows... that would have liked something like..."
027,027_322.txt,1,0.6058095693588257,"i have a few demographic questions that i would like to ask you, but is there anything that you think i should know that i haven't asked you about?","no, aren't you interested in coming to my house and seeing all that i have?"
027,027_322.txt,1,0.3746858239173889,"the antiques especially sound interesting, but it's a little bit of a distance so.",you're in florida.

027,027_323.txt,1,0.445892870426178,that's impressive.,"pole to pole and around the world, that's the goal."
027,027_323.txt,1,0.644022524356842,that's very exciting.,yeah.
027,027_323.txt,1,0.6579369902610779,what is your highest level of education that you've achieved?,i have two degrees.
027,027_323.txt,1,0.6108194589614868,then your sex assigned at birth?,female.
027,027_323.txt,1,0.6112109422683716,and is that the gender you identify with as well?,yes.
027,027_323.txt,1,0.5576953291893005,then what race do you identify as?,"caucasian, white."
027,027_323.txt,1,0.5768441557884216,non hispanic?,yeah.
027,027_323.txt,1,0.5151333808898926,i can give you some ranges if that helps?,yeah.
027,027_323.txt,1,0.41400668025016785,"if you consider it as a combined income, then you can combine both?",i'll ask him.
027,027_323.txt,1,0.409844309091568,"170,000.","okay, perfect."
027,027_323.txt,1,0.3890927731990814,i just have a few more questions to make sure i get your...,we're spending on traveling and hoarding.
028,028_324.txt,1,0.3736723065376282,"the first thing that i'd like to discuss with you is to have you describe your problems with clutter and hoarding, and how long this has been going on.",i think it's probably been going on always.
028,028_324.txt,1,0.5749062299728394,that's a lot to think about and consider.,yeah.
028,028_324.txt,1,0.7994552850723267,how severe would you say that this behavior is now?,how severe?
028,028_324.txt,1,0.2887105941772461,yes.,"that seems like a very unscientific question, but that's okay, because, you know, what i compare myself to, which helps me rationalize and feel okay about myself, is those programs that either used to be on tv called hoarders."
028,028_324.txt,1,0.7556295394897461,"i have seen it, yes.","yeah, so i watched that for a period of time."
028,028_324.txt,1,0.6966583132743835,"do you mind describing your area right now, the space that you live in?",where i'm sitting or generally all the different areas?
028,028_324.txt,1,0.39872440695762634,go ahead and do a brief overview of all of the areas if you feel comfortable.,"okay, so i'm sitting in my living room, which has four seating areas, two lounge chairs, and two couches, and one couch and two lounge chairs are absolutely free for anybody to sit on, and one couch next to my lounge chair is covered in pens, piles of artists' books, different types of sketch pads, an extra box of glasses and different pens, like reading glasses, and some rocks that i picked up at the beach that i've been drawing on and a magazine over there that's been there way too long but it has some really cool pictures that i think i'll refer to again, and a plugin for my phone, and stuff that doesn't belong on a couch."
028,028_325.txt,1,0.44284287095069885,just in case.,my dining room table is not doing too bad right now but generally is overly covered with mail i need to go through.
028,028_325.txt,1,0.3171582520008087,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"and then i have an extra table i put up in my dining room, a small four by two foot table because i've been making greeting cards and it's covered with everything i need to make greeting cards, but it certainly makes my kitchen look full, and full of cluttered things."
028,028_326.txt,1,0.30886027216911316,"in fact, using the word clutter almost seems inappropriate in a way, because it seems like these are tools or supplies for you that you keep in select areas and are aware of, and some of them are there for use, and some of them are there, it seems, because they're aesthetically appealing, like you had mentioned earlier on.",right.
028,028_326.txt,1,0.4048626720905304,where do you store these boxes?,"well, i have this wonderful large garage that i'm grateful for almost every day, and when we first built it, it was a two car garage, and then it became a one car garage because my husband has wind surfing equipment, and he has sporting stuff that he saves, and then slowly but surely i have taken over half of the garage is my stuff, and i have a workspace in there because i also make jewelry, and i do welding, and then i used to work in a school based mental health program doing the arts and crafts, so i have boxes of options for running craft projects, like therapeutic craft projects, with kids."
028,028_327.txt,1,0.640392005443573,how do you decide when it's time to discard an item?,"well, when i left a job that i had for 15 years, i very deliberately decided that i needed to discard some of that stuff i'd been hoarding for those 15 years, for projects, and i spent a week on and off going through those particular boxes on those particular shelves, and i donated a whole lot to a local shelter, workshop, thrift store."
028,028_327.txt,1,0.27752020955085754,is that correct?,"yes, and i have a studio upstairs in my house that is full of both things that i could potentially use to make jewelry out of, but also just cool collectables, but it has gotten to the point where it causes me distress because i would not invite anybody into my studio and a year ago, and before, i would hesitantly allow people in there."
028,028_328.txt,1,0.6119765043258667,"okay, so how do you decide what is valuable and what you should be keeping in those spaces?","well, some decisions are easy, because i really might use them or they really are of value to me either aesthetically, like i like to look at them, but some things just add up."
028,028_328.txt,1,0.6884863972663879,"that sounds like ... when did you start doing that, trying that out, where you put items in a box and then if you don't touch the box for a certain amount of time, then taking it to give it away?","it's probably been just a year but it evolves from something that i've done for a long time, which is trade out items that i've had on display and put them all in a box, and then put up different items that i've been keeping in another box, so that when i notice, if i'm looking around my environment and i realize i haven't actually been looking at these cool things that i set up for myself, if they're invisible to me now, then when i have the feeling like i want to do that, i just take them all off of the mantle, or the desktop, or wherever, the various places, and put them in a box, because they have sentimental value to me."
028,028_329.txt,1,0.37646883726119995,"you're very aware of it though, which is interesting to hear, because you acknowledge that it does cause you discomfort at times, yet there are reasons that make sense to keep the items, too.","yeah, and you know, i do have a background in psychology and mental health, and i believe in looking at myself and trying to improve myself, like i don't want to have low self-esteem, so if i find i do i want to have a strategy to work on that, and i found if certain things are too difficult to work on, i have to work on my attitude about them."
028,028_329.txt,1,0.48479193449020386,that is a very good way to look at things.,pardon me?
028,028_329.txt,1,0.692012369632721,this leads me into a question about have you ever sought professional help to change this behavior?,"no, i've sought professional help a couple times for different things."
028,028_329.txt,1,0.4962964951992035,"it seems like there's a lot of anxiety attached to discarding items and having to decide what should be kept and what can be let go of, and that's what's-","yeah, i was going to say the anxiety there was really about somebody else coming into my house to help me, quote-unquote."
028,028_330.txt,1,0.3744055926799774,"it would be, is it the formal process of having to justify why keeping something that is the bothersome portion of it?","yeah, and yet i don't ... i certainly don't like being judged by people, and i don't like the feeling of being misunderstood, which is being judged, basically."
028,028_330.txt,1,0.36608070135116577,yeah.,"having somebody come into my house to tell me how to get rid of things is already them judging me, and then i would have to explain, i guess, why i'm keeping something."
028,028_330.txt,1,0.5112934708595276,how do your family and your friends feel about the collecting of items in your home space?,none of my friends have told me a negative feeling.
028,028_330.txt,1,0.4185427129268646,i like that that's the example that keeps coming up.,"and my house is not crawling with bugs, or really dirty."
028,028_331.txt,1,0.5291966199874878,"do the items that you have, you said it doesn't bother your husband, does it bother any of your other family members?","i have an adult daughter who moved back in a year ago and no, it doesn't bother her."
028,028_331.txt,1,0.36645403504371643,does that seem accurate?,"yeah, i mean, the garage expansion to me taking over half of the garage has been an issue."
028,028_331.txt,1,0.3621137738227844,"it doesn't actively come to a head, it's just probably, it's mentioned from time to time.","yeah. i mean, we've been together for 32 years, and he doesn't understand it, but occasionally he sees cool stuff being made with miscellaneous crap i've collected for 30-plus years, and he's like, ""oh, you do actually use that rusty old tomato metal thing that i couldn't throw away five years ago."""
028,028_332.txt,1,0.5145753026008606,what inspired that and why would you like to change it?,"well, it's kind of about wanting to be more efficient or productive."
028,028_333.txt,1,0.43738001585006714,"it sounds like the ... yeah, continue.","i kind of forgot your question, and i'm on kind of a rampage here, but, oh yeah, why i'm not getting rid of things."
028,028_333.txt,1,0.45995232462882996,"what inspired starting to do that, like starting to make moves towards getting rid of some items?",that was because my studio was getting out of my control.
028,028_333.txt,1,0.4905621409416199,"how has quarantine specifically affected, and shelter in place, how has that affected your collecting and discarding?","i've not collected more things other than a few rusty things i've picked up during walks and stuff, but you know, i'm not going to thrift stores."
028,028_334.txt,1,0.4801090955734253,"and have you, like with the extra time, has there been any extra motivation or energy to declutter, or has there been any extra energy for other projects, too?","no. i think the energy is really low, and i've tried to be really aware of not getting depressed, and having some routine in my life."
028,028_334.txt,1,0.48265376687049866,that tends to be the case.,like decluttering.
028,028_334.txt,1,0.2968042492866516,"it sounds like there might be more time in the day, but there isn't necessarily the energy or the motivation, because you mentioned there aren't those deadlines there, too, either, to work towards making more for your business, or being held accountable to any sort of timeline.","yeah, you know, i'm just remembering a year ago or so i did a three month coaching session through my job."
028,028_335.txt,1,0.44858524203300476,"i also do not have a sentimental attachment to my kitchen items, so i can understand that.",yeah.
028,028_335.txt,1,0.37436267733573914,"yeah, it seems like that's probably the most uncomfortable portion of it for you, so i'm glad that you were able to find someone that you felt was comfortable to just air whatever you wanted to with.",yeah.
028,028_335.txt,1,0.4701666533946991,"okay, so as now, during this time where you're spending maybe a little bit more time at home, has it made you feel more connected to the items in your house, since you're looking at them more often and around them?","no, it's actually made me feel like it's time to trade them out, and maybe even to decide if i can get rid of some of them, possibly."
028,028_335.txt,1,0.6039393544197083,that's an interesting concept.,right.
028,028_335.txt,1,0.4789125323295593,"i need to redecorate my place, now that you say that.",what's that?
028,028_336.txt,1,0.5434152483940125,i need to redecorate my place now that you say that.,right.
028,028_336.txt,1,0.47031235694885254,how would you distinguish between the hoarding and saving things?,"when it gets past the point where you could actually realistically use all of it, where you really can't rationalize anymore that you're going to use it."
028,028_336.txt,1,0.32589852809906006,"it also seems that you mentioned that once a space gets to be unattractive or a space that you don't really like anymore because of the accumulation of items, that seems to bother you too.","yeah, for sure."
028,028_336.txt,1,0.8117768168449402,and do you think that your behavior fits that definition of hoarding disorder or do you think that your behavior is separate from that?,"sorry, what definition of hoarding disorder are you asking about?"
028,028_336.txt,1,0.42557552456855774,"whenever you said that hoarding is when it gets past the point of being able to rationally justify using items, do you think that that fits a description of your behavior or that you haven't necessarily reached that?","no, i think it does define my issues for sure."
028,028_336.txt,1,0.6375914216041565,has it been through the television shows that you mentioned or any other resources?,"hm. probably originally through the television show, but i mean, years ago i went to university and the psychology department, i might have first learned about it there."
028,028_337.txt,1,0.4888460636138916,"okay. sounds like, yeah, you've had a lot of different exposure to areas where it might come up in your life.",yeah.
028,028_337.txt,1,0.47282686829566956,yeah.,"i don't know, i haven't lived in the city for a long time."
028,028_337.txt,1,0.42048823833465576,"i wouldn't necessarily know how you'd tell know, if you can't see someone's yard or their space as openly.",yeah.
028,028_337.txt,1,0.35257503390312195,"we've talked about a lot of different things, and it's a lot easier to have these interviews and have them be more of a discussion where we kind of go from idea to idea, but then i have to go back and check and make sure we've covered most of our bases.",yeah.
028,028_337.txt,1,0.5831965804100037,"and i think the only questions i'm really left with us what items in your house do you consider to be the most valuable, and what do you think would happen if you were to lose or have to discard these items?",hm. that may be the most thought provoking thing you've asked me.
028,028_337.txt,1,0.507457435131073,i had to end with a big one.,yeah.
028,028_337.txt,1,0.3107461929321289,"well, it's been pretty apparent that monetary value, that's the least important characteristic.","yeah, yeah."
028,028_338.txt,1,0.7914785146713257,yes.,right?
028,028_338.txt,1,0.5492038130760193,okay.,but maybe i should use that as a measure.
028,028_338.txt,1,0.4815533459186554,"so, what would happen if you lost an item that had deep sentimental meaning that is not replaceable that you don't feel okay with parting with?",what would happen?
028,028_338.txt,1,0.5684361457824707,"yeah, do you-","like, to me psychologically?"
028,028_338.txt,1,0.37303435802459717,"however you interpret that, yeah.","yeah, i would feel resentful that obviously someone else is making that choice for me, and understanding that there's real value to that item, and making me get rid of it."
028,028_338.txt,1,0.523649275302887,"sounds like there's definitely, it seems to tie back into the feeling of control you mentioned, when we were making some lists over, like these are your items to decide about, and inviting someone else into your home or having that item taken from you is an example of that control either being taken away, or trust of another individual being diminished.","yeah, or even if people come in and they're not trying to take anything away, to judge me on something as if it's a superficial thing, and not really realizing that it's a much deeper thing, and the risk of being judged is mentally unstable, that a piece of driftwood might be so important to me."
028,028_339.txt,1,0.5148071050643921,"there's something a little weird about everyone, though.","so true, so true."
028,028_339.txt,1,0.6148108243942261,do you have any questions or anything that you'd like to further discuss?,i'm curious about your goal in life in regards to your interactions with people and maybe your livelihood.
028,028_339.txt,1,0.5874976515769958,"do you mind if i ask you a few just paperwork questions real quick, and then i can discuss with you further?",sure.
028,028_339.txt,1,0.6179144382476807,do you identify as female?,yes.
028,028_339.txt,1,0.624104380607605,and what was your sex assigned at birth?,female.
028,028_339.txt,1,0.6448373794555664,your race?,caucasian.
028,028_339.txt,1,0.4874672591686249,your household income?,"about 25,000."
028,028_339.txt,1,0.46193912625312805,was your highest level of education a bachelor's degree?,yeah.
029,029_340.txt,1,0.48140156269073486,... and do you have any last minute questions before we jump into the interview?,not that come to mind.
029,029_340.txt,1,0.6315339803695679,"well we can go ahead and start then, if you're comfortable?",okay.
029,029_340.txt,1,0.601187527179718,"but the first question i want to ask you is what term you prefer when we're talking about difficulties with clutter, and difficulties discarding?",you're asking me what term?
029,029_340.txt,1,0.42195531725883484,what term you would prefer when we're referring to difficulties with clutter and difficulties with discarding items?,"oh, i don't really care."
029,029_340.txt,1,0.5220291614532471,okay.,"i don't find it offensive, is that what you're concerned about?"
029,029_340.txt,1,0.5941819548606873,we just want to make sure you're comfortable.,absolutely.
029,029_340.txt,1,0.5664060115814209,"and so this is more like a conversation between us, rather than me asking you to give me lists of items.",okay.
029,029_340.txt,1,0.40010306239128113,"so we'll first talk about behavior and treatment seeking, and how we can get into this is, would you mind describing your problems with clutter and how long this has been going on for you?","it's been going on about 20 years, and i'm 73 now."
029,029_340.txt,1,0.4690415859222412,"okay, and what does your hoarding disorder look like right now?",well my desktop is covered.
029,029_340.txt,1,0.4755668342113495,yeah.,"yeah, my desktop is covered with things."
029,029_341.txt,1,0.5390654802322388,is this just your-,then i have my computer ...

029,029_349.txt,1,0.430828332901001,and how has being in your home more frequently affected efforts to declutter?,"initially, i was doing really well."
029,029_350.txt,1,0.31568223237991333,that's a good way to put it.,"and i could only do it for maybe an hour at a time, because then i would get anxiety."

030,030_360.txt,1,0.571992039680481,now i want to talk a little bit about what you would ideally like your home to look like.,"well, i would like to be able to use the tables for tables, and not for, yeah, i think i would like it to look a little less full."
030,030_360.txt,1,0.44025543332099915,"so ideally, you would like it to be a bit neater and have kind of less stuff?",yes.
030,030_360.txt,1,0.4037799537181854,"when you think about your possessions, what do you think makes them valuable enough to keep around, and how do you determine whether something has value or if it doesn't?","i think it's, a couple of years ago my mother had downsized, moved from a large house to a smaller house, and she got rid of everything."
030,030_360.txt,1,0.4973088800907135,"so for you, sentimentality is a big aspect of it?",yes.
030,030_360.txt,1,0.3656916916370392,"i know you said you had some maybe monetarily valuable things, but it kind of sounds like that's less important to you than if something has sort of family attachments to it?",right.
030,030_361.txt,1,0.3033548891544342,how do you know that?,"well with things like food wrappers, although then you get into sometimes something comes in a jar that looks like that could be useful."
030,030_361.txt,1,0.35534003376960754,what's kind of your process when you're making those decisions?,INAUDIBLE ... anywhere else.
030,030_361.txt,1,0.4957508444786072,so definitely you can feel overwhelmed when it comes time to get rid of things or figure out when it's time to throw things away?,"i think it's the idea of, asking this is kind of making me think, why is this such a problem, and i think it is the decision making, and there's always something else that needs to be done."
030,030_361.txt,1,0.5745872855186462,and does it get in the way of your daily life tasks?,"i don't think it gets in the way of my daily tasks, but i feel like, some of my friends, just kind of know how it is, and i think people that i don't know that well, i'd be really reluctant to have them come over to my house because i would feel like i would have to kind of, i call it bulldozing."
030,030_361.txt,1,0.3161245882511139,"right, right.","INAUDIBLE ... once you bulldoze, then it's really hard to find things."

030,030_362.txt,1,0.36232542991638184,"has it ever before maybe gotten in the way of something you really wanted to do, like have a new friend over or anything like that?",yeah.
030,030_362.txt,1,0.3845229744911194,"i know you said that your husband, who you live with, is quite understanding, and that there was a time in which it did cause some conflicts with your mom, but other than that, have you every experienced any sorts of impact of the clutter problems on your romantic relationships or your family relationships, other than the ones you've already told me?","no, i don't think so."
030,030_362.txt,1,0.5979952216148376,so what does that look like for you?,"it look likes, he's not..."
030,030_362.txt,1,0.44145917892456055,has there ever been anything like that?,i don't think it ever effected my work.
030,030_362.txt,1,0.36946579813957214,"you would ideally though like to change your behavior, if not because it's impacted any relationships, but mostly just like for personal reasons, you feel personally motivated to change it?","yeah, i think induces a certain amount of stress."
030,030_363.txt,1,0.5554196238517761,"now i'm going to ask a little bit about what you think are the most important differences between what someone might consider normal saving behavior, such as like a collector collecting certain items, and what is considered full blow hoarding disorder?","i think that what most people would think of as a collector would be like a certain type of thing, and they're probably neatly displayed or cataloged, and in boxes maybe."
030,030_363.txt,1,0.7037469744682312,"it sounds like you kind of associated a level of, or rather a lack of cleanliness with full blown hoarding disorder then?","INAUDIBLE ...necessarily... i guess you could have a serious hoarding disorder, but not go to that... i think that would be the extreme."
030,030_363.txt,1,0.5349062085151672,how does hoarding disorder then similar or different from your own behavior?,i think... i guess maybe it wouldn't be a disorder when it gets to the point where it interferes with your ability to function and live a life that doesn't have a lot of anxiety or stress.
030,030_363.txt,1,0.5529766082763672,when it becomes extremely distressing to the person with the problem?,"yeah, sometimes i think maybe it's more distressing to the other people than to the person doing the hoarding."
030,030_363.txt,1,0.3484106957912445,"so you think maybe somebody with a full blown hoarding disorder, would have more of those conflicts that i was asking you about earlier?",yeah.
030,030_363.txt,1,0.46312975883483887,what kinds of mental health issues would you assume that somebody with a full blown disorder might also have?,"like anxiety, and fear of losing things, fear of loss."

030,030_363.txt,1,0.5977113246917725,have you ever known someone who maybe you suspected had some issues with clutter?,INAUDIBLE ... at least one person who i think probably has a serious problem.
030,030_364.txt,1,0.3448421359062195,"so definitely she has like, you've observed some reclusive tendencies, and also a little bit of being secretive, that sort of thing might be a tell in that case?",yeah.
030,030_364.txt,1,0.4392014741897583,where have you heard of it?,"well i remember, i think one of the first times i really heard of it was somebody telling me about somebody that he knew, and this was not somebody i knew, that he said, and he was married, so i don't know if it was her or the husband, but he said, that to go to their house was there was just a little, they had newspapers and things stacked all up in their living room, and there was just a little path to go through, and that was the first time i had ever heard of that, and i thought that's really odd to have, to not be able to walk, to have just a little narrow trail through your house."
030,030_365.txt,1,0.4079269468784332,how do you think that they kind of different from your perspective of your clutter problems?,"when those shows first came out, what was that?"
030,030_365.txt,1,0.39656898379325867,"okay, so seeing kind of the extreme representations of them has kind of helped you a little bit with like the self-identification, it sounds like?","yeah, i think so."
030,030_365.txt,1,0.6828355193138123,is that accurate?,yeah.
030,030_365.txt,1,0.4384910762310028,the first question is should this person try and change their behavior?,"no, i don't think so."
030,030_365.txt,1,0.7984035611152649,would you classify this more as like clutter problems or is this a full blown hoarding disorder?,"oh, it's definitely not a full blown hoarding disorder."
030,030_365.txt,1,0.642297089099884,do you think this behavior is similar or different to your own?,similar.
030,030_365.txt,1,0.5349991321563721,but it's not something that's overwhelming?,"right, yeah."
030,030_366.txt,1,0.684585452079773,do you think is a full blown hoarding disorder or more like clutter problems?,"yeah, if he has to move boxes to still get into the bathroom, i'd say that's a hoarding disorder."
030,030_366.txt,1,0.46552640199661255,so he should try and change his behavior?,yes.
030,030_366.txt,1,0.5869709253311157,do you think he would fit that category?,possibly.
030,030_366.txt,1,0.6129275560379028,would you consider this behavior similar or different to your own?,i think that's different.
030,030_367.txt,1,0.6217866539955139,is this more like clutter problems or a full blown hoarding disorder?,"magazines are in the bathtub, i think that goes a little beyond clutter, and if he's always, if he's almost always late because he can't find things."
030,030_367.txt,1,0.4761064946651459,do you think he should seek treatment from a psychiatrist?,probably.
030,030_367.txt,1,0.6222797632217407,do you think that this is similar to your behavior in any way or mostly different?,"yes, it's different."
030,030_367.txt,1,0.52060866355896,where do you think he fits on this spectrum?,yeah. i think that's...
030,030_368.txt,1,0.4480888247489929,do you think he would require treatment from a psychiatrist?,"i guess part of it is like if it doesn't bother him, and it doesn't effect anybody else, probably not, but if it's effecting his ability... i can't remember if you said that if he's one where he can't find anything, and..."

030,030_369.txt,1,0.4768223166465759,"like buying things or acquiring things for free, has that been changed at all due to covid?","no, i don't think it's changed a lot."
030,030_369.txt,1,0.5579618811607361,has being in the house more made that easier or made it harder?,well i did make some progress at first.

032,032_374.txt,1,0.4471030533313751,"so, it was that sense of permanence that kind of allowed you?","yeah, that's the way to put it."

032,032_375.txt,1,0.5109480619430542,and why do you think you haven't gone for clutter or hoarding?,i guess because i just didn't think it was that big of a deal to talk to a professional about.

033,033_403.txt,1,0.3931502401828766,"similar to the questions that i asked before, should this person try to seek change or try to change their behavior?",yes.
033,033_403.txt,1,0.42398011684417725,"if you were in their shoes, would you decide to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?",i don't think so.
033,033_403.txt,1,0.38101425766944885,you would probably see how much that you could work on changing that behavior before?,yeah.
033,033_403.txt,1,0.45982009172439575,is this similar or different to your clutter problems in any way?,i've certainly spent 10 or 20 minutes looking for an item i use routinely.
033,033_403.txt,1,0.42354971170425415,so there's some similarities and some differences?,"i'd be upset if i was this guy, but i don't think i'm quite as bad."
033,033_403.txt,1,0.33962640166282654,"the 10 to 20 minutes maybe looking for items that kind of relates or you can see some comparisons there, but you don't have to take things out of the bathtub in order to take a shower?",right.
033,033_404.txt,1,0.390555202960968,"he is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.","yes, that is definitely a disorder."
033,033_404.txt,1,0.30561983585357666,"would you say that kind of similar to the other one that you said was definitely hoarding disorder that, yes, he should seek change and that if you were him, you would probably see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?","yeah, yeah."
033,033_404.txt,1,0.49330249428749084,would that be true for this particular person as well or is it bad enough that you would make that recommendation to them?,yes.
033,033_404.txt,1,0.42448344826698303,"again, any similarities or differences with yourself that you see here that are particularly poignant?",very slight.

033,033_406.txt,1,0.4521600008010864,"looking at its impacts just generally again, has covid-19 had any impact on your overall physical health?","no, not."
033,033_406.txt,1,0.5138729810714722,what about any impacts on your overall mental health or wellbeing?,not mine personally.
033,033_406.txt,1,0.4991138279438019,that makes sense.,but i don't see a point in getting really worked up about covid.
033,033_406.txt,1,0.5114254355430603,have you found that there's any coping techniques that are helpful or no?,no. nothing recently.

033,033_407.txt,1,0.5976396799087524,at least like a...,"yeah, exactly."

034,034_408.txt,1,0.447110116481781,so the first thing i'd like you to describe to me is your problems with clutter and how long this has been going on.,i would just say that i keep perhaps more stuff that i need to in terms of thinking of documentation.
034,034_408.txt,1,0.48310619592666626,so there's kind of like those two thoughts in contrast.,yes.
034,034_408.txt,1,0.30061453580856323,"yeah, which is hard to deal with and probably leads to the accumulation of a lot of these books, which it sounds like you probably have on a lot of interesting and useful topics.",yes.
034,034_408.txt,1,0.48674657940864563,so do your problems-,and i have a barnes and noble account.
034,034_408.txt,1,0.6063592433929443,do your problems mostly with clutter center around keeping books?,"well, i'd say it's largely books and documents."
034,034_408.txt,1,0.485050231218338,"and how severe would you say that this behavior is now, meaning can you walk through your spaces where you save items?","yes, i can."
034,034_408.txt,1,0.7731927633285522,are there any other areas or is it particularly that closet?,that closet.
034,034_408.txt,1,0.6032581329345703,and did you mention that you live alone?,no. i have a housemate.
034,034_409.txt,1,0.34292614459991455,okay.,and then sometimes i have his two children each individually living with us in the third bedroom.
034,034_409.txt,1,0.48813125491142273,do you feel that your space would look any different if you didn't have a roommate?,yes.
034,034_409.txt,1,0.5478255152702332,how so?,it would be improved.
034,034_409.txt,1,0.7603963613510132,does he also keep items or is it more so just day to day cleanliness?,day to day cleanliness.
034,034_409.txt,1,0.5176185369491577,that's got to be frustrating CROSSTALK at times.,pardon?
034,034_409.txt,1,0.5285294651985168,that's got to be frustrating at times.,"oh yes, yes."
034,034_409.txt,1,0.5691858530044556,"and so whenever you think about the items that you do keep, you mentioned a few qualifiers for what makes them valuable to you, but do you mind going through those again?",of what those things are-
034,034_409.txt,1,0.5575140118598938,of what makes the items that you keep valuable to you.,i keep documents like diplomas and awards and photographs and art works.
034,034_409.txt,1,0.4118019640445709,cool.,"for personal notes, like when i go to the marijuana store or when i go to a restaurant and leave a tip, i often leave a card."
034,034_409.txt,1,0.41638416051864624,that's awesome.,"so that they have a nice private note with a little bit of eye candy and they can then write whatever they wish to whomever, put it in the envelope that i provide and add a stamp."
034,034_409.txt,1,0.406220406293869,"yeah, in the last few years of her life, that was important to her.",right.
034,034_409.txt,1,0.4530877470970154,do you happen to-,enclose the rent check in the card with a pretty picture on it.
034,034_409.txt,1,0.4777677655220032,do you then keep any notes that you receive from others?,"some, but most of them eventually get either put in the file cabinet or lost."
034,034_410.txt,1,0.47822728753089905,how do you determine what you're going to throw away or donate?,"well, just my own judgment, i guess."
034,034_410.txt,1,0.6278984546661377,that's an awesome thing to do.,yes.
034,034_410.txt,1,0.6661369204521179,sounds like it was well deserved.,"yes, it was."
034,034_410.txt,1,0.36326295137405396,"so it sounds like you're a very practical person and that you keep items that have value to you, but you're also looking for ways to maybe trim down, keeping paper copies of records or, like you don't keep every note sent to you.",INAUDIBLE
034,034_410.txt,1,0.7418708801269531,and why is it valuable?,what items are most valuable?
034,034_410.txt,1,0.42051348090171814,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"i have an oil painting that a friend, who's since died, made that needs to go to a museum eventually."
034,034_410.txt,1,0.39797067642211914,he was really cool.,"and so i'd want to grab that, my autograph by divine, which i got on my 36th birthday."
034,034_410.txt,1,0.4783468246459961,so no need for the physical actual existence of it.,yes.
034,034_411.txt,1,0.4716049134731293,"if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?","i think just going from area to area and tossing things into boxes, like donate, destroy, recycle, shred."
034,034_411.txt,1,0.40494367480278015,it might just be that they've had value for you up to this moment and it's the action of actually getting around to evaluating if they still hold that value for you.,yes.
034,034_411.txt,1,0.6443139314651489,okay.,that's a good way of putting it.
034,034_411.txt,1,0.4541405141353607,so it's just-,"and if there's something that i just don't have any use for, it's broken or i don't even want to look at it anymore, then throw it away."
034,034_411.txt,1,0.5455899834632874,"so how you distinguish normal saving behavior such as collecting and then behavior like yours, with difficulties with clutter to the point where you can't see the floor in a certain room.","i know for me, it's like i said, the quality of things, like the variety of things i'm keeping, not because i feel an attachment, but because i feel the possibility of needing the item in the future."
034,034_412.txt,1,0.3948158621788025,so it might be hard to find enough space to give each item or each group its own place.,right.
034,034_412.txt,1,0.452080100774765,"and it sounds, so it sounds like you-",political as well.
034,034_412.txt,1,0.3358108401298523,"it seems like they have a lot of value to you, both for remembering but also remembering why you do those things in the first place or reminding you of what you believe in.",yes.
034,034_412.txt,1,0.47297346591949463,so how do you decide if your behavior of collecting or of saving items is a problem?,"well, part of it is deciding when you're looking at say, something like moving, where you really want to try to minimizing the stuff you have to move."
034,034_412.txt,1,0.4495968818664551,it just takes a little bit of time that we often don't think we have.,yes. that's right.
034,034_413.txt,1,0.4626080095767975,"first i want to ask you, does your behavior of collecting items and not really discarding, does that upset you at all or does it get in the way of every day life?",it does to some degree because it limits my mobility.
034,034_413.txt,1,0.36526936292648315,has your keeping items ever gotten in the way of romantic or family relationships?,i don't think so.
034,034_413.txt,1,0.2574014961719513,"but then also, a lot of people are distressed because they're external pressure is from other people asking them, why do you do this or wanting them to get rid of items.",right.
034,034_413.txt,1,0.4070100784301758,you kind of CROSSTALK-,i haven't found a scholar or university or something to see if they would like to be in line to either inherit or purchase this library for students and scholars to use.
034,034_413.txt,1,0.3884442150592804,you have so many items that are so valuable and such a diverse...,"yeah, i'm a specialist."
034,034_413.txt,1,0.8797513246536255,which one?,"oh dear, which one is it?"
034,034_413.txt,1,0.5593056082725525,that's so interesting.,i'm going to check which book it is.
034,034_413.txt,1,0.8857142329216003,i haven't read that one.,you haven't read that one?
034,034_414.txt,1,0.533416211605072,and i'm working through the rest of them.,"yes, good, good."
034,034_414.txt,1,0.336532860994339,sounds-,"i taught a course called, the political ideas of kurt vonnegut."
034,034_414.txt,1,0.3369320034980774,that's an interesting book.,when i was teaching college back in the '70s.
034,034_414.txt,1,0.5251891613006592,you were teaching college?,yes.
034,034_414.txt,1,0.5757068395614624,and i hope that someone else finds the same value in these items because they're definitely CROSSTALK.,"yes, yes."
034,034_414.txt,1,0.6959019899368286,"well, now that you have all this time, probably more so sequestered in your home than before, due to covid, have you found that there's extra time to organize items?","well, i've found more time to think about organizing them, yes."
034,034_414.txt,1,0.37413716316223145,they do require CROSSTALK.,and time and figuring out social distancing and what have you as well.
034,034_414.txt,1,0.3655358850955963,"have you found that being in your home more so than before, if that's the case, has affected your sense of connectedness or your attachment to the items you have?",possibly.
034,034_414.txt,1,0.4853581488132477,you seem to CROSSTALK,so those i have to enter in by hand.
034,034_415.txt,1,0.7236347198486328,is this something you were thinking about prior to covid?,"yes, it is something i was thinking of prior to covid, just because i realize that i have more stuff than i want."
034,034_415.txt,1,0.5256946086883545,"it just gave you more time, it seems to CROSSTALK","yes, i think so."
034,034_415.txt,1,0.4550829827785492,and how have you been doing with your physical health since quarantine started?,i'm not too bad looking.
034,034_415.txt,1,0.32511070370674133,and how have you been feeling and doing mentally since about march?,"well, i have a housemate who we were friends and have some history together, but we've been living together for two years, and he hasn't been doing his part in paying for expenses and rent and so forth."
034,034_415.txt,1,0.25278598070144653,"yeah, so that's-","been a very stressful situation and because he doesn't work, he's at home all the time."
034,034_416.txt,1,0.3857484459877014,it gives you a break from looking at the person.,"exactly, exactly."
034,034_416.txt,1,0.5085974335670471,the mess they're creating.,"the mess they're creating or doesn't have the understanding that there's three stages to say, having a meal."
034,034_416.txt,1,0.3865834176540375,which is you.,"there's an ending process, a cleaning up and putting away, recreating the status quo ante that is of the situation that was before."
034,034_416.txt,1,0.449413925409317,it sounds like that could be-,for the next person who walks into the space finds it as expected.
034,034_416.txt,1,0.5401227474212646,how are you coping with that or getting some distance from it when you're not really able to leave your house and see other people conveniently?,"well, sometimes leaving the house and seeing other people is part of it and getting out to see friends, that's, part of it is, i belong to a couple of senior organizations."
034,034_417.txt,1,0.6923199892044067,that's overwhelming to be around.,so very stressful to live with it.
034,034_417.txt,1,0.5196991562843323,and it sounds like that'll be a welcome change for you.,"yes, indeed."
034,034_417.txt,1,0.3907030522823334,"and not only will it get you out of that situation, but it'll help with cutting down on items too.",mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
034,034_417.txt,1,0.49820801615715027,"it could be, you never know.","and get out of here, yeah."
034,034_417.txt,1,0.5215553045272827,did you have anything else you wanted to discuss?,"no, no. it was a very interesting chat and actually valuable for me in processing some thinking."
034,034_417.txt,1,0.45426979660987854,i loved talking to you and getting to hear about what you've worked on as well as what you value.,"well, i hope others in the study are similarly of interest."
035,035_418.txt,1,0.5692188143730164,"if you have any problems hearing me at any point, just let me know.",okay.
035,035_418.txt,1,0.747471272945404,"how it began, how it became a part of your life, and how it moved to how it is now?",how did it begin?
035,035_418.txt,1,0.6868032813072205,does that sound right?,right.
035,035_418.txt,1,0.5025736093521118,so it tends to pile up more.,right.
035,035_419.txt,1,0.8089388012886047,"you think it's been years, do you think it's been more recent than that?","i think, oh, it's definitely been years."

037,037_453.txt,1,0.28267696499824524,"so, you've mentioned messy space, someone who doesn't pay attention as much to their appearance, someone who may be self-centered or someone who talks about their collecting.",mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
037,037_453.txt,1,0.33578726649284363,"okay, would that complete your list?","i guess, i feel INAUDIBLE speak from my experience and perhaps my mother and my brother."
037,037_453.txt,1,0.4748336374759674,"so, our last listing question is, please list all of the reasons that people may want to seek treatment for hoarding.","if it takes over their life, if they want to have more personal connections and their collections or collecting is keeping them from getting to that point, running out of money, and did i say running out of space?"

037,037_454.txt,1,0.3295127749443054,right.,of wanting and sort of needing to try to get a return on my problem.
037,037_454.txt,1,0.5131525993347168,"right, so it started off as a monetary thing but it just grew and grew into more of a collecting instead.","yeah, i don't know where the separation INAUDIBLE where i separated it but then i think money may have driven me more."

037,037_455.txt,1,0.491105318069458,if i feel like we're going off on a tangent i'll interrupt you but no that was great.,okay.
037,037_455.txt,1,0.5697135329246521,do you believe that your behavior is a problem or has it gotten better over time?,well i think the fact that i no longer buy like i had means i'm going in the right direction.
037,037_455.txt,1,0.4039766490459442,right.,i could give you an example if you want but i'm going to let you decide whether you want to find out how well i'm doing or INAUDIBLE.
037,037_455.txt,1,0.36710211634635925,an example would be great.,"okay, so in the middle 70s i became a fan of the band kiss, are you old enough to know kiss?"
037,037_455.txt,1,0.6486403942108154,"yes, i do know who they are.",well they're famous enough that even a college student would know.
037,037_455.txt,1,0.3336963653564453,right.,"well, in 1976 they were a real INAUDIBLE band and they weren't mega stars yet but i saw them and they were amusing, i like the music, so i bought a kiss garbage can, i bought about five kiss belt buckles."
037,037_455.txt,1,0.423563688993454,oh wow.,"so, you may say, ""how many belt buckles does a person need?"" and the answer is one, okay?"
037,037_455.txt,1,0.5542510747909546,oh wow.,so i got rewarded for my behavior.
037,037_455.txt,1,0.5420287847518921,it just maybe took awhile but that's okay.,it what?
037,037_455.txt,1,0.5582350492477417,it just maybe took awhile but it worked.,well in a sense it was good that i let them sit in a box for 40 years.
037,037_455.txt,1,0.39236554503440857,right.,the person who bought them said that they could have gone for more money so perhaps the pandemic has changed the way people are spending their money.
037,037_455.txt,1,0.5188806056976318,for sure.,i was happy with the money i got.
037,037_456.txt,1,0.5869802832603455,right.,and i got rewarded.
037,037_456.txt,1,0.5925745368003845,have you ever sought to change your behavior or gone to a professional?,i saw a psychologist for...but that was not about hoarding.
037,037_456.txt,1,0.34459155797958374,okay.,"so i don't think i ever considered, i never thought of the point that i had gotten to as a serious enough problem to see someone."
037,037_456.txt,1,0.29747238755226135,okay.,i think one reason that it didn't become a problem was because as i grew older i had more space and space can be a problem for someone but i never got to a point where i needed a storage locker like some people.
037,037_456.txt,1,0.42352285981178284,so you never went specifically for hoarding it was for other things?,"definitely not, no."
037,037_456.txt,1,0.3918047845363617,you mentioned that your mom and your brother have issues with hoarding as well but how do your other family members and friends feel about your behavior?,i think they're amused by me because of the rabbits that i pull out of my 40 year old boxes.
037,037_456.txt,1,0.507244884967804,okay.,so i don't have an issue with friends.
037,037_456.txt,1,0.7340483665466309,do you live alone or is their someone that lives with you?,i live with my spouse.
037,037_456.txt,1,0.6809963583946228,i know you mentioned you've been decluttering your garage but could you describe-,we have a single car garage with a lot of shelves and on those shelves...do you want me to describe my accumulations or just the physical layout?
037,037_456.txt,1,0.46888431906700134,"you can describe both, just how your house is with your stuff in it.","okay, so the garage has shelving, some of which came with the unit and i realized how large it was so i bought more shelves."
037,037_457.txt,1,0.6721372604370117,"yeah, so other than these two rooms with the clutter would you say that the rest of the house is cluttered or is it usable space as well?","no, none of the house...at this point in time, the garage is no longer clutter because the floors are clear and you can see the shelves."
037,037_457.txt,1,0.4646119475364685,"so then is your home the way that you would like it to look or are there any changes other than, of course, the decluttering that you have been doing?",that's the only thing that really needs to be changed.
037,037_457.txt,1,0.6093423962593079,how important are your collections and your things for you to feel at home in your space?,i still have certain collections that i'm attached to.
037,037_457.txt,1,0.53972989320755,so your motivation is for your children not having to go through what you went through with your mother's things?,"right, and one of the other things that encouraged me was something that happened maybe 20 years ago when i was selling another collection that i had was the impermanence of it and the fragility of it and the knowledge if i kept INAUDIBLE going to disintegrate so i'd rather let somebody else give me a few hundred dollars and let them worry about disintegration."
037,037_457.txt,1,0.5014621019363403,what else makes them valuable to you?,i think INAUDIBLE i could do my list on this question because the few collections that i haven't thought about divesting yet are things that i think are just brilliant and i really like them.
037,037_458.txt,1,0.4756533205509186,"so what would you consider trash, what do you discard?",oh boy.
037,037_458.txt,1,0.32424411177635193,yeah.,but if you become... i have been fairly obsessive about recycling but recently certain things that i've read and just trying to live life we've decided actually yesterday that we may not be recycling everything that can be recycled or that we can try to recycle.
037,037_458.txt,1,0.3482953906059265,CROSSTALK,"that's part of the issue and i think that one of the problems that's i have had, which i managed to not do the last two days is if i get a package, because we do buy things by mail a lot."
037,037_458.txt,1,0.5631824731826782,right.,more than we might otherwise-
037,037_458.txt,1,0.8746147751808167,because of covid?,because of the pandemic.
037,037_458.txt,1,0.7648414373397827,right.,yeah.
037,037_458.txt,1,0.5065538287162781,"right so, sometimes you keep things thinking you might use them and then you never end up using them?","yeah and i think, okay i'll just throw it in this box."
037,037_458.txt,1,0.48015841841697693,okay well that's good.,it's a little hard because of my background.
037,037_458.txt,1,0.5157761573791504,what is the most precious in your house for you?,wow.
037,037_458.txt,1,0.47954365611076355,or collection of items.,the most precious...that's a good question.
037,037_459.txt,1,0.6973204612731934,so you don't even remember.,yeah so i don't even have the memory that i wanted to retrieve.
037,037_459.txt,1,0.6209671497344971,right.,but that's kind of funny.
037,037_459.txt,1,0.42806529998779297,wow.,this was a number of years ago and they probably over paid and i don't know if the market is still that good but one of my friends had tickets to a similar show and i sold two for her for $500 each too.
037,037_459.txt,1,0.6122888922691345,would it be a traumatic event or would you be okay?,no i don't think it would.
037,037_459.txt,1,0.3246399760246277,okay.,i think one reason i'd be sad is because i didn't sell them.
037,037_459.txt,1,0.5028209686279297,so the loss of the money would be upsetting.,pardon me?
037,037_459.txt,1,0.312608003616333,the loss of the money would be upsetting but other than that CROSSTALK you'd be okay.,"yeah, you know i do focus on that to some extent because of the experience of doing things like that."
037,037_459.txt,1,0.36286309361457825,sure.,"i'm going to say when i was maybe 10 years old, i could have been younger, i got a... there was some kind of bullwinkle club item."
037,037_459.txt,1,0.4888007342815399,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,do you know rocky and bullwinkle?
037,037_459.txt,1,0.5329631567001343,i do.,"okay, good, you're a real INAUDIBLE kid."
037,037_459.txt,1,0.5566295981407166,wow.,"so, you see that's the problem."
037,037_460.txt,1,0.39960774779319763,"right, so yeah you've been like an entrepreneur with all of your items so, i mean...",yeah.
037,037_460.txt,1,0.5269628763198853,yeah.,you know it gives me obviously a mixed message.
037,037_460.txt,1,0.35003554821014404,right.,"but i think, like i said, i don't... and even after i sold that there were some things that i bought."
037,037_460.txt,1,0.47287747263908386,"okay, so in this moment in time do you think you have too much stuff even after decluttering a little bit?",definitely.
037,037_460.txt,1,0.5386977791786194,so how do you decide when you have too much?,i've been at that point.
037,037_460.txt,1,0.5322341918945312,okay.,INAUDIBLE how i feel about it.
037,037_460.txt,1,0.593710720539093,okay.,"i'm not near that, however, is it a finite?"
037,037_460.txt,1,0.6289281845092773,right.,we'll see.
037,037_460.txt,1,0.5807667374610901,what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?,"i think that it would have to be what would be considered a reasonable amount of things that you have accumulated so if you look into somebody's garage and they have 10 packages of paper towels i would say okay they're hoarding, pandemic aside."
037,037_460.txt,1,0.3974177837371826,"right, right.",nothing to do with the pandemic because i've seen some of my neighbors garages.
037,037_460.txt,1,0.3955616056919098,well free is good.,INAUDIBLE i guess if you have more things than you can use by the expiration date then you have a problem.
037,037_460.txt,1,0.49544018507003784,"no, if that's what you believe then... there's no right or wrong answers.",okay.
037,037_461.txt,1,0.5251404047012329,how is it the same or different from your own behavior?,"repeat that, please."
037,037_461.txt,1,0.38533109426498413,how is hoarding disorder the same or different from your own behavior?,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
037,037_461.txt,1,0.3470262289047241,like what it looks like.,well i certainly have in the past bought more than i needed of something so that's one of the things that sticks in my mind.
037,037_461.txt,1,0.5515124797821045,okay.,i don't know if i have-
037,037_461.txt,1,0.45099517703056335,so usefulness and just amount of time possible to use all the stuff?,yeah.
037,037_461.txt,1,0.41083094477653503,do you believe there is a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?,there's a good question.
037,037_461.txt,1,0.37680140137672424,okay.,"although not necessarily, depends on what they're buying but that would be the only way."
037,037_461.txt,1,0.570326030254364,do you read about it or watch tv shows?,"no, i don't watch, i think there is a show about hoarding."
037,037_461.txt,1,0.5101836323738098,"yes, it's on tlc.",no i haven't seen that show.
037,037_461.txt,1,0.6705315709114075,"yeah, so you definitely experienced it as a child so you heard about it then.",well as a child...
037,037_461.txt,1,0.4454229772090912,what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?,i guess i think a little bit about whatever level of problem i have and i think of my mother.
037,037_461.txt,1,0.4555557668209076,now we're going to move into a section about distress and interference.,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
037,037_461.txt,1,0.6816403865814209,"so, does your behavior and your hoarding upset you?",does it upset me?
037,037_462.txt,1,0.4191924035549164,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,i wouldn't say that it's... i guess it causes stress to do it.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.5213356018066406,so discarding.,yeah and i mean part of it is knowing that i'm never going to use it but still not wanting to put it in the garbage can.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.3733136057853699,do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?,only to the extent where the garage became the way it was.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.4497331380844116,so now we're going to move into two remaining sections about the covid pandemic.,okay.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.3626634478569031,how has covid-19 impacted your life?,"well, initially we went out and hoarded food."
037,037_462.txt,1,0.3552045226097107,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,hopefully in a practical way we tried to buy enough food for a period of time.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.3794558048248291,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"it means i almost never go to a store so, not that i was doing any kind of buying that was in the hoarding sphere... give me the question again?"
037,037_462.txt,1,0.6752040386199951,"so you go to the less, of course.",we go to the store less.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.7648414373397827,right.,yeah.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.4073793292045593,has covid affected your difficulties with discarding or has it been more or less the same?,it's maybe been easier because i have more time to do that.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.4465233385562897,"so, would you say covid has had a positive effect in your attempts to declutter?","yeah, for practical reasons, yes."
037,037_462.txt,1,0.43500468134880066,has covid impacted your overall physical health?,"no. no, i mean if anything i've... depending on the weather, when the weather was really good i was exercising more."
037,037_462.txt,1,0.5059401988983154,well that's good.,so i think i'm maybe healthier but INAUDIBLE.
037,037_462.txt,1,0.3979271650314331,"okay, and has covid affected your overall mental health or well-being?","no, it's just a pain in the neck... i worry more when i'm not in my safe space at home."
037,037_462.txt,1,0.4352329671382904,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,if i go to store i'm a little concerned because i'd rather not.
037,037_463.txt,1,0.4148457646369934,"right, yeah.","we don't go often and we're pretty careful, we're always masking."
037,037_463.txt,1,0.4895370900630951,how has or has covid affected your family financially?,"so far, no."
037,037_463.txt,1,0.5230931639671326,how have you been coping since covid-19?,i worry about everybody.
037,037_463.txt,1,0.5165048241615295,do you seek comfort from your items or from others?,"INAUDIBLE not from my items, no. i guess my interactions with humans other than on the phone or neighbors that we might see in the parking lot."
037,037_463.txt,1,0.5091691017150879,you were talking about interactions with people.,yeah.
037,037_463.txt,1,0.5564664602279663,have you sought treatment resources or some other kind of professional support during covid?,"no. i haven't felt the need to do that from covid, no. i think there was one point where my wife was getting a little stir-crazy, i don't know if it was the weather was keeping us in more than usual or just missing human contact."
037,037_463.txt,1,0.4254482686519623,"oh, how nice.","so we're trying to get something to keep us out of INAUDIBLE horrible, horrible place."
037,037_463.txt,1,0.4962579607963562,has covid affected any sense of isolation or loneliness?,"yeah, i miss being able to casually see somebody."
037,037_463.txt,1,0.4599042534828186,yeah.,"but i've kind of learned to do that one exercise, the class one, on my own at home."
037,037_463.txt,1,0.43118205666542053,so some things you've learned to adapt to and other things you still miss.,yeah.
037,037_463.txt,1,0.5767701268196106,and my last question is have you experienced any conflict during the covid-19 measures?,"conflict... well, i live in a condominium and our condominium association won't schedule our meetings, i don't know if that's a conflict because i think they could somehow figure it out but it's not much of a conflict."
037,037_464.txt,1,0.291817843914032,okay well-,i think a lot of times we find that the peoples' behavior is not safe and putting us at risk and that's created conflicts for us.
037,037_464.txt,1,0.78281170129776,so like not socially distancing?,"yeah, not socially distancing, not masking, not caring at all about that."
037,037_464.txt,1,0.4836343228816986,"okay, that's unfortunate, yeah.",small confrontations with people but nothing dangerous.
037,037_464.txt,1,0.55567467212677,so now i just need to ask you a couple of demographic questions just for research purposes.,sure.
037,037_464.txt,1,0.6540614366531372,so what is your gender identity?,i'm of the male persuasion.
037,037_464.txt,1,0.5184150338172913,"okay, and sex assigned at birth the same?",pardon me?
037,037_464.txt,1,0.5681412816047668,sex assigned at birth?,yes.
037,037_464.txt,1,0.5667318105697632,and race?,white male.
037,037_464.txt,1,0.5617602467536926,ethnicity?,a mixed breed.
037,037_464.txt,1,0.4309411346912384,you can give a range if you prefer.,"we're both retired and it's hard for me to gauge but i'll say $50,000."
037,037_464.txt,1,0.5906866192817688,"okay, and your geographic region?",northeast.
037,037_464.txt,1,0.6263166666030884,and your highest level of education?,i have a bachelor's degree.
039,039_465.txt,1,0.6492886543273926,do you not think that your hoarding is as bad as the people you were just describing or why not seek treatment?,i know my hoarding is bad and right now i have a relationship.
039,039_465.txt,1,0.682479977607727,"oh, congratulations.",yeah.
039,039_465.txt,1,0.5384568572044373,"you don't think so, your hoarding, you don't think it can be fixed?",nope.
039,039_465.txt,1,0.4605383276939392,i was just going to ask if you had any family member that had had it.,yeah.
039,039_465.txt,1,0.5389621257781982,right.,it was a joke in the family.
039,039_466.txt,1,0.5999101996421814,"of course, you have to believe in it and all that but i'm definitely happy to hear your opinion on that.",yeah.
039,039_466.txt,1,0.3557383716106415,right.,"at best, i probably have 20 years to live and i am thinking about getting rid of a lot of stuff."
039,039_466.txt,1,0.44167783856391907,"so, you save books, you save bags, you save boxes, are there anything else that you save?",for a while i was really into buying shoes.
039,039_466.txt,1,0.5464298129081726,"shoes, got it.","i started having a love affair with shoes when i was about a sophomore or junior in high school and discovered that you didn't have to wear saddle shoes or brogans, that there were really nice stylish imported fashionable shoes so i started buying really good and unusual shoes."
039,039_466.txt,1,0.3895229399204254,"you started collecting that, huh?",yeah. but i never ever made much money so that didn't last too long.
039,039_467.txt,1,0.6629967093467712,so you got pairs of shoes-,i bought these shoes six years ago and i'm still wearing them.
039,039_467.txt,1,0.4220677316188812,how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?,"well, i just don't differentiate."
039,039_467.txt,1,0.4240405559539795,okay.,and i found a particular model or brand of bow ties on amazon and i bought every bow tie this particular company sold.
039,039_467.txt,1,0.574788510799408,"and so you really like bow ties, as well?",some of these things just tickle my fancy.
039,039_467.txt,1,0.3201448917388916,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"and when i started losing a lot of weight i decided, well, instead of wearing a belt i'll wear suspenders, so i went through a binge of buying suspenders."
039,039_467.txt,1,0.36251550912857056,so you kind of get hooked on maybe items of fashion or something like that and you start collecting a lot of them.,yeah.
039,039_468.txt,1,0.5180763006210327,"what do you discard, what things are you-",very little.
039,039_468.txt,1,0.6279689073562622,okay.,very little.
039,039_468.txt,1,0.39668336510658264,"it sounds like what you're telling me is you don't really throw that much stuff away and you'll even save scraps of paper that have a little bit of space even though maybe it would be a better idea to throw it out, because then you have a lot of papers to sort through?",right.
039,039_468.txt,1,0.523777425289154,let's-,the same thing goes for paper towels or napkins.
039,039_468.txt,1,0.5635910630226135,always just saving little parts?,i don't waste any part of a paper towel.
039,039_468.txt,1,0.6010450720787048,can you tell me about what you space looks like?,"well, this room where i write my book is..."
039,039_469.txt,1,0.5045413970947266,"it sounds like you do have a pretty considerable amount of clutter, huh?",yeah.
039,039_469.txt,1,0.5589467287063599,"are you able to use your kitchen for its purpose, your bed for its purpose or are you kind of-",the kitchen and the bathroom are pretty void of clutter.

039,039_472.txt,1,0.5085954070091248,what differentiates that in your mind?,"well, i make a difference between the two in that hoarding is something that you save the same kind of thing or even the same thing."
039,039_472.txt,1,0.3373822569847107,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"whereas, boxes for instance, and i always go back to boxes because, of course, there is kind of an anteroom before you get into the basement in this house and that room is nearly ceiling to floor in boxes."
039,039_472.txt,1,0.38563475012779236,okay.,"you can still get down the stairs and go into the part of the basement where the washing machine is and the water heater and the fuel tank and so forth, but most of it is taken up by bookcases, a big bookcase as well as just stacks of boxes."
039,039_472.txt,1,0.3011571168899536,okay.,"it's the hoarding of something that's pretty much the same, whereas clutter can be a number of things piled in a pile or thrown in a corner or thrown in a box, shoved under your bed, that's clutter."
039,039_472.txt,1,0.4217774569988251,"the difference is besides just having a pile of something, it's a lot more things in a lot more places, right?",yeah.
039,039_473.txt,1,0.36647748947143555,and the compulsive-,"well, occasionally i have walking the street or walking some place, i'm very aware of the person if they lean down and pick up off the ground either on the sidewalk or on the ground something that, some people have a phobia about picking up anything that is on the ground, particularly on the sidewalk in a public place."
039,039_473.txt,1,0.35594871640205383,right.,"if i see somebody do that i have often thought, ""oh, they save things like i save things."""

039,039_473.txt,1,0.4014725089073181,can you notice that when you go into their home or can you notice that when you're just speaking with them and they start talking about the stuff that they save?,yeah.
039,039_473.txt,1,0.6615110635757446,that make sense?,yeah.
039,039_473.txt,1,0.5097605586051941,do you think that this person has hoarding?,definitely.
039,039_473.txt,1,0.3816381096839905,and why do you think that?,"specifically, because again, it's pretty much the same object, in this case boxes."

039,039_474.txt,1,0.47767138481140137,do you think this person has hoarding?,i think it's a combination of both.
039,039_474.txt,1,0.2922151982784271,can you tell me a little bit more?,"well, because he keeps these boxes i would say that's hoarding and i would say that because there's stuff located all over his house to the point that he can't find his keys and maybe not ever, or at least for the time that he needs them, that's due to clutter."
039,039_475.txt,1,0.5527295470237732,do you think this person has hoarding?,yes.
039,039_475.txt,1,0.42515072226524353,"and so far, how does-",it's so bad that either he has a very small house and can't come up with something creative.

039,039_475.txt,1,0.3668536841869354,do you think it's kind of similar?,no. i haven't stooped so low so to speak to store things where i can't take a shower.
039,039_475.txt,1,0.32686737179756165,right.,"if i lived by myself maybe that would be something different, but i have a partner to think of and she's got it, she takes a shower more often than i do and i certainly couldn't put things in the shower."

039,039_476.txt,1,0.5108243227005005,do you think that this person has hoarding?,yeah.
039,039_476.txt,1,0.3569074273109436,right.,"if you collect things that you don't use even though you think they are of value, it's hoarding as far as i'm concerned."

039,039_476.txt,1,0.40998581051826477,right.,i think that is absolutely essential to a definition of hoarding.
039,039_476.txt,1,0.433746874332428,so having a lot of items-,that's what makes the whole thing absolutely ridiculous.
039,039_476.txt,1,0.36514419317245483,"so it's like even though those things could be of value to someone, you have so many items that it's at the point where things don't even get used?",yeah.

039,039_476.txt,1,0.5068336129188538,no worries.,i really think that you should revise your story.
039,039_476.txt,1,0.34542033076286316,okay.,"and especially, if more of the answers were to be that he can't find his keys because of clutter, then it would be more appropriate, but since most of the answers, at least the way i answered them, feel that it's hoarding."
039,039_477.txt,1,0.4214675724506378,okay.,i don't really think that's a very good part of the story.
039,039_477.txt,1,0.7473437786102295,because you think that folks tend to be pretty good about remembering their keys?,"not that they tend to be good about, a lot of people can't remember where they put the keys, but it's usually, it just has to do with memory and with putting the keys down in a place that they normally don't put them, therefore, they don't remember."
039,039_477.txt,1,0.6390975117683411,thank you for that perspective.,yeah.

039,039_478.txt,1,0.524939239025116,do you think covid has affected your sense of connectiveness or attachment to your items or is it pretty much the same?,"well, it's kind of, but it's not covid per se, it's just that i'm getting older and i have enough nice things and we have, we're both as i said, readers and have bought a lot of books in our time, but not crappy books."

044,044_535.txt,1,0.45537835359573364,"and out of those items, what do you feel are the most important to you?",in the whole house?
044,044_535.txt,1,0.45933374762535095,"and out of your items, what do you say are the most important to you?",okay.
044,044_535.txt,1,0.43807557225227356,do you feel like those things are necessary for you to feel at home in your house?,those things are necessary because they've been there for 150 years.
044,044_535.txt,1,0.47735336422920227,"so, they're important due to their-",they're family.
044,044_535.txt,1,0.2983677387237549,their family value but you wouldn't say you necessarily spend a lot of time with them.,correct.
044,044_535.txt,1,0.47759196162223816,what items in your house do you spend a lot of time with would you say?,i'd rather be outside.
044,044_535.txt,1,0.5304754376411438,"okay, so you know your necessary items in the kitchen, your bedroom, your television, but you wouldn't say that the other items that are piled and the stuff in the boxes aren't really things you spend a lot of time with.","well, they're just things that need to be distributed sometimes."
044,044_535.txt,1,0.507169783115387,what would you like your home to look like?,"less cluttered, you can see the floor."
044,044_536.txt,1,0.3224422335624695,"so, basically you'd just like a more open area where you're able to walk around easier, where the floor is clear of things and you'd be able to have maybe people over.",yeah.
044,044_536.txt,1,0.4990011751651764,"yeah, so cleaner and more clutter-free is what i'm hearing.",yeah.
044,044_536.txt,1,0.5024160146713257,what other things would you determine how your objects are valuable or not?,i don't know.
044,044_536.txt,1,0.29078468680381775,"so, you would say really the way to determine an object is valuable or not is how far back it goes maybe in the family or if it's family-related?",yes.
044,044_536.txt,1,0.4673280119895935,"so, maybe also something that is very useful but was also a good deal.",oh yeah.
044,044_536.txt,1,0.4313930571079254,"thinking about the items in your house, what would you say is the most precious item?",i don't know.
044,044_536.txt,1,0.48131465911865234,and is that precious or valuable to you monetarily or are they family-related?,they're my first.

044,044_536.txt,1,0.3597826659679413,"so, when things start piling up, it's getting hard to move around or you have things that you're not using, that's when you decide, okay, i think i have too much.","yeah, yeah."
044,044_537.txt,1,0.4975130558013916,what would be your process of choosing between things?,hopefully the biggest items first.
044,044_537.txt,1,0.9428406953811646,or bigger boxes?,bigger boxes.
044,044_537.txt,1,0.4426419138908386,and what's trash for you and how do you know when it's time to throw something away?,that's difficult.
044,044_537.txt,1,0.5651362538337708,what else would be trash?,i might figure out that i have way too many plastic bags.
044,044_537.txt,1,0.5229260921478271,"yeah, so you hold on to those things that might be trash but you feel you might also need it in the future.","yeah, and if i was organized, which is never going to happen, and knew where everything was, i might know when i had too much of something."
044,044_537.txt,1,0.5502372980117798,"so, thinking about what do you think are the most important differences between saving or collecting and hoarding?","well, the mess is the hoarding."
044,044_537.txt,1,0.3675510287284851,"but if it's organized and kept in the place it needs to be, that could be considered saving or collecting.",yes.
044,044_537.txt,1,0.32631435990333557,and what does hoarding disorder look like and how is that same or different from your behavior?,"let's see, i like to blame it on not having the energy to take care of it."
044,044_537.txt,1,0.5242570042610168,what would you say hoarding disorder looks like?,"messy, dangerous, wasteful."
044,044_537.txt,1,0.46986356377601624,and would you say that's the same or different from your behavior?,that's not nice.
044,044_537.txt,1,0.4129500985145569,but is there a way to tell someone if they have hoarding disorder without being in their home?,i don't know.
044,044_537.txt,1,0.4060395658016205,where have you heard of it before?,"on television of course, my husband turned it on all the time."
044,044_537.txt,1,0.47090649604797363,"so, yeah-",but it wasn't like i intently watched it either.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.6525651812553406,maybe internet or books or any of that sort?,i haven't looked it up on the internet.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.5532944202423096,and what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?,it sounds greedy.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.44884535670280457,"so, just thinking about your issues and difficulties with collecting treasures, does your behavior upset you?",makes me feel good when i'm doing it.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.3325637876987457,"so, it feels good when you're keeping your items but maybe looking at everything from an outsider backwards picture it just seems like more of an obligation, more to deal with.",yes.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.3692326843738556,can you describe a time where your behavior has gotten in the way of something that you really wanted?,yes.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.5641105771064758,"so, it's getting in the way of some of that legal paperwork because it's gotten lost.","yeah, i know there's things that i have worked on and that i can't find."
044,044_538.txt,1,0.4178958833217621,do you think it's ever impacted any other family or romantic relationships?,i don't know.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.3858102262020111,"so, would you just say it's mostly impacted your relationship with your son?",yes.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.6912233233451843,what about work?,i don't work anymore.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.447529137134552,"would you say before, when you were working, it affected it in any way?",i don't think i was terribly organized.
044,044_538.txt,1,0.526113748550415,why or why not?,i would be more comfortable if it were changed.
044,044_539.txt,1,0.3098280131816864,"yeah, so you think that you would like to change your behavior because it would make your space more comfortable, less dangerous and you'd feel better ultimately.",yes.
044,044_539.txt,1,0.5757214426994324,would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of them?,i would be having to make decisions about things.
044,044_539.txt,1,0.5549039840698242,"right, so it's just more overwhelming than anything, that decision making?",the decision making about tossing isn't about tossing things.
044,044_539.txt,1,0.37276986241340637,"okay, so it's more so about whether to not to throw out things away that's more distressing.",yes.

045,045_540.txt,1,0.5379981398582458,when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter?,"oh, i don't care, whatever's convenient for you."
045,045_540.txt,1,0.5375651121139526,"okay, so just hoarding disorder then is fine?",sure.
045,045_540.txt,1,0.7477670311927795,"so the first one is going to be, what was your sex assigned at birth?",what was my sex?

045,045_540.txt,1,0.42781907320022583,so that completes the free listing portion of the interview and the next part is going to be-,good.
045,045_540.txt,1,0.38077712059020996,"my first question is going to be, can you please describe your hoarding and how long it's been going on?","okay, you have my age there."
045,045_541.txt,1,0.7573515176773071,okay. so how severe would you say your behavior is now and do you believe that your behavior is a problem?,i definitely believe my behavior's a problem.
045,045_541.txt,1,0.36695194244384766,"and so when you said that when you were younger you didn't have many items, so you didn't ever have any problems pickup up after yourself or you just didn't grow up with much at all so that it just didn't happen?","well, it's hard to know."
045,045_541.txt,1,0.3748016953468323,okay.,"and i don't think i developed really good organizational things but i have things ... i have many things back from, easily back from late teens and i'm 73."

045,045_541.txt,1,0.35177677869796753,how did you find that person?,"ironically, through grief counseling and she was quite young."
045,045_541.txt,1,0.3387565612792969,have you ever had conflicts with them or maybe a landlord even?,"my father was probably sort of a hoarder, not too bad but somewhat and then my mother became a hoarder, only after she developed alzheimer's."
045,045_542.txt,1,0.40243712067604065,okay.,after her alzheimer's kicked in and probably not everything but enough so that it was a challenge.
045,045_542.txt,1,0.3788527250289917,oh wow.,that my parents had in trunks and things.
045,045_542.txt,1,0.7113026976585388,okay.,so it's that.
045,045_542.txt,1,0.3790869116783142,"okay, so then, you've had pretty heated conflicts then with family members about this?",i have the one sister.
045,045_542.txt,1,0.5415179133415222,are you still living in that same house and do you live alone there right now?,yes.

045,045_542.txt,1,0.4334958791732788,so would you-,"seriously, i don't know if you've seen bad clutter situations i suppose."
045,045_542.txt,1,0.34770625829696655,"okay, so there are parts through homes that you don't-","because this house was completely filled, every crook and cranny, and then i moved 1500 square feet of my jammed in crammed possessions into this house on top of that."
045,045_543.txt,1,0.6053906679153442,"okay, so would you say that there are parts of your house maybe like the kitchen or bathrooms that you aren't able to access and that just are storage areas right now?",they're like storage areas but i'm very skilled at accessing things in storage areas.
045,045_543.txt,1,0.5679153800010681,"okay, so would you say that maybe your floor is entirely covered with either stacks of boxes or papers or are there parts of the floor that are actually clear that you can see?","well, i have my exercise space, which is clear."
045,045_543.txt,1,0.42759957909584045,so what would you-,"but then it regresses and then it reverts back, alarmingly quickly."
045,045_543.txt,1,0.32700976729393005,okay.,and then the worst indicator of my mental condition is how much stuff is in the bed i sleep in.
045,045_543.txt,1,0.5525689125061035,and you live alone then?,yes.
045,045_543.txt,1,0.590399444103241,so what would you like your home to look like then?,"i would like to be, i mean, i even would like some rooms to be almost minimalist, even like your ... think of a magazine, a shot of a modern home that's all very ... only a few pieces of furniture and possibly not even any carpet, a very modern home."
045,045_544.txt,1,0.5230371356010437,"okay, and when you say cozier-",or more normal.
045,045_544.txt,1,0.40724945068359375,"okay, and when you say cozier-",and i know normal is an impossible word to use but ...
045,045_544.txt,1,0.6384062767028809,"okay, so-",do you have a feel for what i'm saying?
045,045_544.txt,1,0.6260972619056702,which objects are the most important ones that you spend most of your time with?,"probably books, most of my time with books and magazines."
045,045_544.txt,1,0.4767285883426666,"okay, do you often miss bill payments then if you don't get through the mail in time?","no, not often."
045,045_545.txt,1,0.29929372668266296,so when you think about your possessions what really makes them valuable and how do you determine if they're valuable or not?,"well, i've probably done too much of that."
045,045_545.txt,1,0.49627870321273804,"so when you were saying you cleared those out, how did you decide what was trash, what to actually get rid of?",in those storage lockers that weren't my things?
045,045_545.txt,1,0.5774198174476624,yeah.,or in my own?
045,045_545.txt,1,0.399876207113266,"i'm curious about both, INAUDIBLE-","well, it's a lot of paper usually."
045,045_545.txt,1,0.5193460583686829,"okay, so what i'm understanding is when you have multiples of things it's easier for you to get rid of something, right?","if they're identical, usually, now that might not be true with clothes because i always try to use up things."
045,045_545.txt,1,0.5440611839294434,"okay, well-",using it up is the way to get rid of things.
045,045_546.txt,1,0.4266187846660614,and that's when you decided to throw it away?,"no, i found a way of rebuilding the bottom with shoe glue."
045,045_546.txt,1,0.5937923789024353,in regards to shoes or clothes and stuff?,yeah.
045,045_546.txt,1,0.5751598477363586,okay.,"i can comfortably, to comfortably throw it away, yes."
045,045_546.txt,1,0.35694390535354614,okay.,"i mean, shoes are an example where if they're not in very good shape any more i probably wouldn't spend a lot of money resoling or re-heeling them because i would see that there wouldn't be sufficient value or if i did then i would be stuck wearing them for a really, really long time."
045,045_546.txt,1,0.35683271288871765,how much value something's worth?,"shoes are a little bit easier because getting them resoled and re-heeled it has become pretty expensive but if i really, really love them, also if they fit well, i have a little bit of a trouble getting shoes to fit well."
045,045_546.txt,1,0.3603487014770508,okay.,"so it's back to that respecting the thing and a thing actually is mistreated it's like it has a life, it's a living thing almost."
045,045_546.txt,1,0.6411425471305847,"so hmm, how do you choose between your items, about ...",that i want to keep?
045,045_546.txt,1,0.6412987112998962,"yeah, okay, so if you had to choose between items, like you had to keep these and you had to get rid of some, how would you choose?",see the problem is i actually don't have to get rid of things.
045,045_547.txt,1,0.5304855704307556,okay.,but i do have a box here i'm putting things in.
045,045_547.txt,1,0.43875476717948914,so do you think that you have too much stuff?,without a doubt.
045,045_547.txt,1,0.29974374175071716,"how do you know when you just have too much, when it's time to maybe try to get rid of something?","well, my goal is ... in fact i had my upstairs ... i have a reverse plan house."
045,045_548.txt,1,0.4572397768497467,"okay, so does this behavior get in the way of your daily life and has it got in the way of something you really want then?","well, yes, because i mean, it's my top number one goal is to accomplish this and my goal is each day to move ... my therapist is asking me to ... or suggesting i do baby steps but keep at it and make ..."
045,045_548.txt,1,0.4528125822544098,okay.,our communication wasn't good on that subject and i hesitate to bring it up.
045,045_548.txt,1,0.47100338339805603,would it upset you if she told you that she had gotten rid of them?,i don't think i want to hear.
045,045_548.txt,1,0.7236319184303284,okay.,a little bit.
045,045_549.txt,1,0.4683493375778198,"there's no way around it, you're going to have to get rid of some of this stuff, would that really upset you?",i would need a lot of time to prepare myself and get in the right mental state.
045,045_549.txt,1,0.4331420361995697,okay.,"to work through all the emotions, get myself prepared."
045,045_549.txt,1,0.48524028062820435,"what kind of emotions are you, i guess exactly experiencing when you throw something away?","yeah, all of the above."
045,045_549.txt,1,0.42469319701194763,"and so earlier you mentioned you don't have the best relationship necessarily with your sister but you mentioned that you have a book club, how did they feel about your hoarding problem?",i don't think they were terribly aware of it because i had things in reasonable shape in the only two rooms they saw.
045,045_549.txt,1,0.4810001850128174,so they didn't have access to the rest of the house at all?,not at all.
045,045_549.txt,1,0.3488682210445404,okay.,"in fact, fortunately somebody had a toddler so i was able to put a blockade across the other part of the house so that the toddler didn't go down there and then so it was clearly off limits to go there."

047,047_571.txt,1,0.5578534007072449,"what i'm hearing from you is that it's definitely the memories that make it hard, the sentimentality of not wanting to throw away your relatives in a sense.","yeah, but then it's more than that because, when i try to throw things out, i look at each item separately."
047,047_571.txt,1,0.5008843541145325,yeah.,"it feels so good to have more open space, that clutter gone."
047,047_572.txt,1,0.3309895098209381,so you would say that not wanting your son to have to deal with your collections is something that makes you know when it's time to throw something away?,"no. well, now with the covid-19, i feel like i think people are thinking about mortality more."

047,047_572.txt,1,0.33144018054008484,okay.,"so i didn't really have the time, even though i know people, if they have an hour or two, they can get stuff done."
047,047_572.txt,1,0.6375658512115479,"so just switching gears just a little bit, have you ever sought to change this behavior, like going to a professional or a counselor?","i have been to counselors, but i had other problems i was dealing with, like anxiety and depression."
047,047_572.txt,1,0.3740163743495941,okay.,i actually did hire a professional organizer that was just for people who have clutter problems.

047,047_573.txt,1,0.5442548394203186,yeah.,it's very emotional based.
047,047_573.txt,1,0.5101647973060608,how did you find this person?,i think through recommendations from my doctor-
047,047_573.txt,1,0.5448886752128601,okay.,"i went just recently, it was for something else."

047,047_574.txt,1,0.8976134657859802,"okay, so it's definitely a livable space.","yeah, it's livable."
047,047_574.txt,1,0.4171586036682129,okay.,"i don't have any animals, so there's nothing like ..."
047,047_574.txt,1,0.28838667273521423,of course.,the ones that have animals and they can't take care of ... the animals are pooping in the house and then that adds to the problem.
047,047_574.txt,1,0.35271647572517395,"of course, yes.","i think i'm lucky that my son was allergic to cats and i had to actually disown, re home my cat when he was little."
047,047_574.txt,1,0.6126784682273865,okay.,i think that helps a lot.
047,047_574.txt,1,0.510064959526062,okay.,my friends kind of ... a couple of my friends are similar.
047,047_575.txt,1,0.31320714950561523,okay.,"but lately though, my daughter-in-law's parents have moved up, so none of the social things are happening at my house anymore, and they say because my house isn't as big as her parent's house."
047,047_575.txt,1,0.5511290431022644,"so now that we're talking more about your own home, can you tell me what you would like your home to look like?","i would like it to be organized and clean, just everything in its place."
047,047_575.txt,1,0.5248811841011047,so just to have things in it's place.,more open space.
047,047_575.txt,1,0.7759013772010803,so you would like everything to have its own space.,"yeah, its own place and space and more space."

047,047_576.txt,1,0.5551106333732605,so which items do you feel you spend the most time with?,probably the books and my rock collection.
047,047_576.txt,1,0.4518280327320099,so are there any parts of your home that you don't use?,"yeah, there's one room that was my computer room, and that's the room that i'm working on."
047,047_576.txt,1,0.37188592553138733,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,"because i have books in there i don't use, i'm just going to give away."
047,047_576.txt,1,0.6031045317649841,just trying to get it-,getting them out of the house.
047,047_576.txt,1,0.41195276379585266,"yeah, out of the space.","because i'll look in there again and i'll be like, well do i really want to get rid of that?"
047,047_576.txt,1,0.5146508812904358,mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.,maybe i should keep that in case someone needs it.

047,047_576.txt,1,0.5716373920440674,"so are there any parts of your home that aren't used in the intended way, other than your computer room that you use more for storage?","no. the bathroom is clear, the kitchen is clear, the bedrooms are clear."
047,047_576.txt,1,0.3961372375488281,so now i'm going to ask you a couple of questions about what makes things valuable to you and what do you consider things to be trash.,okay.
047,047_576.txt,1,0.5196430683135986,"so when you think about your own possessions, what else makes them valuable?","well, because i was a collector with coins, i know how valuable a coin is or a bill is based on how old it is, what condition it's in."
047,047_577.txt,1,0.9497961401939392,so monetary value then.,"yeah, monetary value."
047,047_577.txt,1,0.5241959095001221,okay.,i have clothes that are like retro clothes.
047,047_577.txt,1,0.46892204880714417,"wow, that's so cool.","so was makes it valuable is the sentimental value, that monetary value."
047,047_577.txt,1,0.36949339509010315,of course.,just kind of the emotional value.
047,047_577.txt,1,0.49999257922172546,it was sentimental to her.,yeah.
047,047_577.txt,1,0.553683876991272,okay.,then photographs too.
047,047_577.txt,1,0.4868607223033905,"what are the kind of times that you discard, other than the papers that you've said?","oh. well, things that are ... if they've got stuff on them, like food on them, or if they have any type of mail."
047,047_577.txt,1,0.47336143255233765,"okay, so just normal trash that you don't want.",yeah.
047,047_577.txt,1,0.5631463527679443,"so what do you consider the most precious item in your house, if you can choose one?",i'd say photographs.
047,047_577.txt,1,0.4042300879955292,so why do you consider photographs to be the most valuable thing you own?,"well, before we got smartphones, that was our way of kind of taking a moment and keeping it."
047,047_577.txt,1,0.4754270613193512,right.,i have pictures of my parents and my sister that i cannot retake.
047,047_577.txt,1,0.36003875732421875,right.,they're moments frozen in history and they're precious because you remember back to that time.
047,047_577.txt,1,0.5996314287185669,"of course, yeah.",so i guess those are-
047,047_577.txt,1,0.519442617893219,the memory of it you don't want to part with.,yeah.
047,047_578.txt,1,0.7105022668838501,"so if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?",like what to keep?
047,047_578.txt,1,0.6258745193481445,yeah.,what do you mean?
047,047_578.txt,1,0.4876684248447418,i guess just the criteria of how you would choose.,"to get rid of anything, or what?"
047,047_578.txt,1,0.6317567229270935,"yeah, i guess if you had to choose the criteria of what type of items you would keep if you had to choose between items.","probably keep the ones that were in good shape or from a family or friend that is gone, that i couldn't recycle or that someone else didn't need."
047,047_578.txt,1,0.5714495182037354,right.,that's probably my criteria.
047,047_578.txt,1,0.5932905077934265,so meaning to more than just yourself.,what do you mean?
047,047_578.txt,1,0.7116664052009583,"just that you were saying if it has meaning to not just yourself, but other people as well.","no, i just mean if it just meant something to me."
047,047_578.txt,1,0.8730338215827942,okay.,it's okay.
047,047_578.txt,1,0.5291207432746887,"what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting and hoarding disorder?",i think it's in the way a person can look at an item and decide quickly whether it's really worth saving.
047,047_578.txt,1,0.8651506900787354,so they're just taking the emotion out of it is what you're saying.,"yeah, take the emotion out of it."
047,047_578.txt,1,0.5241173505783081,okay.,they would get less of something.
047,047_578.txt,1,0.9288969039916992,it sounds like minimalism.,"minimalism, yeah."
047,047_578.txt,1,0.40390753746032715,so do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?,that's a good question.
047,047_579.txt,1,0.4271201193332672,right.,"so if somebody looks a little bit off balance, you might think, i wonder what that entails."
047,047_579.txt,1,0.35308027267456055,"it's difficult, yeah.","i was at work as a nurse, and i don't think people saw that in me."
047,047_579.txt,1,0.4351421296596527,"right, yeah.","so i don't think people can see that automatically, but i don't know."
047,047_579.txt,1,0.5665393471717834,where have you heard of it before?,"well, after i kind of realized i had it, i just looked it up on the internet."
047,047_579.txt,1,0.5925212502479553,right.,i just looked it up there.
047,047_579.txt,1,0.5653488636016846,"okay, so the internet definitely was one of your sources.",yeah.
047,047_579.txt,1,0.5370152592658997,so is there-,i got a book on it too.
047,047_579.txt,1,0.40845489501953125,my last question for you is what do you think of when you hear the words hoarding disorder?,"oh, just really bad, super bad looking house and a person who's kind of messed up inside."
047,047_579.txt,1,0.5380473136901855,that's interesting.,"oh, you're working from home."
047,047_579.txt,1,0.5138543248176575,"yeah, i'm so sorry.","of course, everyone is now."
047,047_579.txt,1,0.5710646510124207,i'm so sorry.,"no, no. i'm glad you're still able to ..."
047,047_579.txt,1,0.6262146830558777,yeah.,"yeah, i just kind of think that ..."

047,047_580.txt,1,0.269448459148407,yeah.,but he kind of learned from her that you don't hold on to things.
047,047_580.txt,1,0.5338968634605408,you just have trouble parting with your favorite things.,"yeah, and other things, a whole house full of things."

048,048_584.txt,1,0.33913013339042664,and then you also mentioned prior that there's this kind of scurry when you find that there's going to be an inspection to clean up some things.,yeah.

048,048_585.txt,1,0.3834690749645233,so do they know-,"my life is at times, but that's nonsense."
048,048_585.txt,1,0.7774096131324768,"or because they've never seen it, they're not really aware?",i think mostly they're not really aware.
048,048_585.txt,1,0.47322145104408264,i understand.,"i live in a apartment complex that has a lounge, has a terrace, has a courtyard, has other places that i can engage or entertain guests."
048,048_585.txt,1,0.5434319376945496,so can you describe a little more what this space is like?,every surface pretty much is stacked with things.

050,050_610.txt,1,0.32389527559280396,so it sounds like it was really important for the counselor that you're seeing to kind of validate that it's not your fault that you can't just clean up your apartment.,yes.
050,050_611.txt,1,0.3308110535144806,so it ended up being kind of group therapy for her rather than for everyone.,yeah.
050,050_611.txt,1,0.3073882460594177,and she kind of derailed the group overall and that hurt your experience.,yeah.
050,050_611.txt,1,0.45940929651260376,can you talk a little bit about how you think that your hoarding problems have impacted your life socially?,most of my friends either i've told them or they have seen it progressed enough where they understand why they can't come over.
050,050_611.txt,1,0.32291439175605774,sure if you feel up to it.,"yeah, because when i'm just trying to survive those friendships go out of the way."
050,050_612.txt,1,0.37550872564315796,it sounds like also you have a group of friends who you have been friends with over a long period of time and because they kind of saw it develop.,yeah.

050,050_612.txt,1,0.44937071204185486,but your closest friends you're comfortable with.,yeah.
050,050_612.txt,1,0.5419095158576965,"so this could be with friends or family or other people who are around your space, like landlords or neighbors.",i never had any issues with my neighbors.
050,050_612.txt,1,0.6235350966453552,i'm kind of out of the loop.,okay.
050,050_612.txt,1,0.4902063012123108,"oh yeah, the simplifier lady you're talking about.","yeah, and so everything."
050,050_612.txt,1,0.40027546882629395,totally makes sense.,so i have all the piles from where i've tried and then i began to have to step over those tiles because i don't have time to complete the entire tasks.
050,050_612.txt,1,0.5078601241111755,yeah.,either i get tired or need to go to sleep or something like that.
050,050_613.txt,1,0.6509048342704773,does that sound right?,okay.
050,050_613.txt,1,0.6012048721313477,"i'm not, i'm trying to-","no, no, sometimes you don't hear what you're saying."
050,050_613.txt,1,0.3138735294342041,and what the space is like and also the kinds of things that you tend to hang on to and how they are situated in your space right now.,"well, my condo was 1386 as far as square feet."
050,050_613.txt,1,0.6285104751586914,are they in boxes or are they out?,most of it's out.
050,050_614.txt,1,0.6311768293380737,are you able to go in and out of the spaces comfortably?,not comfortably.
050,050_614.txt,1,0.5856183171272278,"are you able to use your kitchen, your bathroom?","yeah, i can use it, but it's not pristine or anything like that."
050,050_614.txt,1,0.37431517243385315,"so the space is still basically usable by you for the things that you need to do, but it sounds like it's difficult for you to navigate and not easy for you to kind of do the things that you might want to do, and you're worried about falling that sound, right?",yeah.
050,050_614.txt,1,0.34970012307167053,it's like your recreation.,"and not to be here, not because it's dirty, but almost just not to be here because there's nobody there but me."
050,050_614.txt,1,0.5319491624832153,and you feel like having the dog was helpful because you had company and so you didn't shop as much?,i had to be home because you just got to walk the dog or i was going to have poop to clean up when i got home and stuff.
050,050_614.txt,1,0.373468279838562,it gave you a routine.,"and it was just an expensive thing to have, even though i honestly think that someone like myself could get or should be able to get an animal as a support thing because of the fact that when you're totally by yourself, it's nice to have somebody to at least or feel like there's somebody in your house."
050,050_615.txt,1,0.5687910914421082,would there still be stuff in it?,say that again?
050,050_615.txt,1,0.6267980337142944,what would it look like?,it would totally be different.
050,050_615.txt,1,0.3652968108654022,does that sound right?,"yeah, because i would like to go back to entertainment."
050,050_615.txt,1,0.3655553460121155,"so do you feel like the items that you hang on to, the items in your home, do they contribute to making you feel at home in your space?","no. some of the things that i get are you know how people look at info marshals, and they buy all the exercise equipment?"
050,050_616.txt,1,0.4902358651161194,they want to be a person.,does that make sense?
050,050_616.txt,1,0.5317795276641846,they want to be a person that exercises.,yes.
050,050_616.txt,1,0.46640676259994507,it's more that you're waiting to be a person who will use them.,yes.
050,050_616.txt,1,0.6147300004959106,i want to make sure i'm not putting words in your mouth.,"no, you're doing good."
050,050_616.txt,1,0.5776216983795166,"so what are the items in your home that you feel like you spend the most time with, or that you use the most, you engage with the most?","obviously my dvds, my television and my microwave."
050,050_616.txt,1,0.44848114252090454,it's mostly that you watch tv CROSSTALK.,"except for getting dressed for work and stuff, trying to find something that looks appropriate or that i just didn't roll over."
050,050_616.txt,1,0.538578450679779,do you go through them to wear them or are they mostly just being stored?,"oh yeah, definitely go through to find."
050,050_617.txt,1,0.6789076924324036,and how do you determine which of those are the most valuable?,i think that they are valuable.
050,050_617.txt,1,0.3738444447517395,"yeah, i was kind of wondering if you think that the things that you have are valuable and which things you value the most of the things you have.",okay.
050,050_617.txt,1,0.42759940028190613,"totally depends on you, how you would like to answer that question.",i think the most valuable thing that i have in that house is myself.
050,050_617.txt,1,0.5458019375801086,"when you're going through your stuff, how do you decide when it's time to get rid of something?",if i feel like it doesn't fit my needs or future needs or it's broken.
050,050_618.txt,1,0.5179674625396729,"so you don't have the problem of, once you decided that something is going to be discarded, yeah it's gone?",it's gone.
050,050_618.txt,1,0.6984501481056213,and so it's gone?,yes.
050,050_618.txt,1,0.7044157981872559,is that right?,yeah.
050,050_618.txt,1,0.4539887607097626,so you'll hang onto something if you think that you're going to be able to do it in the future?,yes.
050,050_618.txt,1,0.5724939703941345,so it's all stuff that is possible for you to use?,yes.
050,050_618.txt,1,0.4912491738796234,"and even if you haven't used it, even if it's been sitting around since the day you bought it and it's still kind of right in front of you, as long as it's still possible for you to use it, you'll continue to hang onto it?","well, i think there is the expiration date on that possible."
050,050_619.txt,1,0.5622183084487915,so there's kind of a limit on-,yeah.
050,050_619.txt,1,0.4032711386680603,what for you is the biggest difference?,the difference would be i would tell that person it's part of being colorblind in the sense that you know that there are things that are different colors.
050,050_619.txt,1,0.40927526354789734,does that sound right?,yeah. yes. and then also i think it has something the more i read about it as stuff like that.
050,050_620.txt,1,0.45974987745285034,that totally makes sense.,"and so you don't see that as something that i feel like a normal person would be able to see, but i can't."
050,050_620.txt,1,0.4225043058395386,so it ends up not having anything be done as opposed to just a little bit at your time.,right.
050,050_620.txt,1,0.47008052468299866,"do you think if you met somebody who had these problems and you didn't see what their house looked like and they didn't tell you, you would notice this behavior?",i think that you would have a sort of clue about me in the sense that i can live with a lot of stuff around me at work.
050,050_621.txt,1,0.5813378095626831,definitely.,i don't think-
050,050_621.txt,1,0.5065817832946777,"yeah, go ahead.",i don't think you can look at stuff yourself.
050,050_621.txt,1,0.5962792038917542,what are the main sources of information you have about it?,i usually look at the internet.
050,050_621.txt,1,0.4709765911102295,do you watch the hoarding reality tv shows?,sometimes.
050,050_622.txt,1,0.4171840250492096,"you worry that would also be kind of like all of your neighbors would be seeing you do that if you were to do it, so.",yeah.
050,050_622.txt,1,0.3141030967235565,so she ends up asking you and that ends up taking twice as much time because you're having to tell her what to do.,right.
050,050_623.txt,1,0.4481591284275055,do you feel like hoarding disorder is stigmatized?,oh yeah.
050,050_623.txt,1,0.8343918919563293,sure.,yeah.
050,050_623.txt,1,0.39072683453559875,what springs to mind?,well because it depends on if they're talking about somebody else and it all of a sudden has me feeling like we need to circle in a little bit and protect myself around that person.
050,050_623.txt,1,0.2741650938987732,"but other times you feel like it's safer for you to kind of stick your head up and say ""wow, it's really not their fault.'",yeah.
050,050_624.txt,1,0.3521624803543091,do you feel like that's at all related?,"no, because of the fact that this is more of like fight or flight type of hoarding in the sense that people feel like if they have to go out and get stuff, it's like every time i go out, it's a russian type thing."
050,050_624.txt,1,0.3966478705406189,"yeah, people are panicking.","if i had the choice of hoarding a little toilet paper so i didn't have to go outside and possibly catch this thing, heck yeah."
050,050_624.txt,1,0.496377557516098,has it made CROSSTALK?,i really didn't.
050,050_625.txt,1,0.5711226463317871,"yeah, not more than usual.",so it did not affect me that way.
051,051_626.txt,1,0.502479612827301,"interviewer : okay, so before we get started, i just wanted to ask you what term you prefer when we're discussing issues with clutter or hoarding, if there is a term you prefer.",clutter.

051,051_631.txt,1,0.5644989013671875,can you describe the cluttered areas for me?,"yeah, so, um, like in my bedroom, i have got, um, right now there's a pile in front of one of the closet doors that includes a green trash bag that i've been throwing clothes in to donate."
051,051_635.txt,1,0.4812789857387543,"interviewer : so, um, financial value is important but not the most important thing?",yes.
051,051_637.txt,1,0.5159757137298584,"interviewer : okay. so, when information about, you know, hoarding disorder, how would you say that its similar or different from your own disorder?","okay so, from a— the reason i don't like the word hoarding is, although i have used it on myself in the past, um, but part of the reason i don't like that word is because it indicates— it's gotten an indication through, you know, for better or for worse— through you know, through television programs or whatever."
051,051_638.txt,1,0.41041329503059387,"i know you mentioned earlier that maybe they're a bit reclusive more so than usual, but is there anything else that you might notice in someone?","yeah, somebody who can never find what they're looking for."

052,052_650.txt,1,0.509717583656311,"interviewer : okay. and, in terms of like media and television, do you ever get any information about hoarding disorder from there?","we don’t use much television or social media, but in my work i have a colleague who’s a clean-up specialist and he actually will rarely come onto a job if the owner’s still alive."
053,053_652.txt,1,0.603072464466095,"so the first question i want to ask you is, what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter or difficulties discarding?",what term... what do you mean?
053,053_652.txt,1,0.7795910239219666,"i mean like, are you okay with using hoarding disorder or would you prefer like problems with clutter?","probably since i'm not familiar with the diagnostic criteria of hoarding disorder, i would say definitely that i have a problem with clutter."
053,053_652.txt,1,0.48951512575149536,so could you please describe your own problems with clutter?,mostly with regard to paperwork and some objects that are sentimental.
053,053_652.txt,1,0.5640367865562439,could you elaborate on what are these objects?,objects like dishes or gifts perhaps if someone gave me in the past.
053,053_652.txt,1,0.6678115725517273,and how long has this been going on?,"oh, probably, you know, for a long time."
053,053_652.txt,1,0.6321693658828735,"okay, and how severe would you say this behavior is now?",i don't think it could be classified as severe.

053,053_652.txt,1,0.6089329123497009,and do you believe that your behavior is a problem?,"yeah, it’s a problem."

053,053_654.txt,1,0.30672475695610046,"so what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?",you’re asking me?
053,053_654.txt,1,0.4922872483730316,"yes, what do you think?",i think that if it’s a problem then it’s disordered.
053,053_654.txt,1,0.3683009445667267,"i'm sorry, could you elaborate a little bit more?","well i guess organization.. i’m thinking of a man i knew once that collected insects, and he had a room in his house that was filled with drawers and display cases and framed shadow boxes and you know he has thousands and thousands of insects in there."
053,053_655.txt,1,0.33769264817237854,"okay so organization and just being able to find things, that's more of a collector, but a hoarder has less organization and it's more disordered, of course.","yeah, and i suppose the value of the object itself."
053,053_655.txt,1,0.4241786003112793,"okay, and what does hoarding disorder look like?",it looks like a house that you can't walk from one room to the next.
053,053_655.txt,1,0.3652675747871399,"okay, and based on your description, how is that the same or different from your own behavior?","i keep a lot of stuff, that i have no use for, but i think at some point i might want to look at it."
053,053_655.txt,1,0.3724830746650696,"okay, so for you, your problems with clutter is it's less like obstructive in your house, but you definitely put things away, but it’s less organized.",yeah.
053,053_655.txt,1,0.48385000228881836,"okay, and do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without being in their home?","well, i guess it would be if someone was  incoherent and then they told you, but no. i don’t know."
053,053_655.txt,1,0.726720929145813,so you don’t think so?,probably not.
053,053_655.txt,1,0.4221716523170471,where have you heard of it?,"well there’s the television, and there’s more just the general culture i think , than any kind of scientific journal."
053,053_656.txt,1,0.540726363658905,"okay, that’s interesting, and what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?","well i’ve had a tenant once who was definitely a hoarder, and we had to evict her from the rental property because of her behavior, so i think about that."

053,053_656.txt,1,0.45855745673179626,"what kind of things were going on that you had to evict her, like what was she doing that made it so severe?","well this was a house that was a shotgun house, and the house was almost packed from ceiling to floor with stuff, you could barely get through it, and i was worried about the actual structure of the house because she would put shelving and then put heavy objects on the shelves, which i thought would stress the wall and the floor joists, because there was just so much stuff."
053,053_656.txt,1,0.3847288489341736,so it was definitely a safety concern as much as a structural concern.,yeah.

053,053_656.txt,1,0.4668888747692108,could you elaborate on why it upsets you?,i think that there might be a circumstance where i would need to lay my hands on something quickly and i wouldn't be able to do it.
053,053_656.txt,1,0.5222552418708801,"right, so it causes you distress, because you don't like to look at it, and it might be a financial harm as well.","yeah, and uh it makes me feel like i’m crazy when i know that i have something and i can't find it so it causes me emotional stress because i feel like i'm losing my mind when i think i've just put something down and now it's missing."

057,057_703.txt,1,0.6566988825798035,do you ever have trouble throwing something away? does it cause any sort of anxiety? having to discard things?,"not really, i don’t know. i guess for some reason i can’t, or, i, i, i have difficulty getting rid of bags and things like that. like backpacks, or…"

057,057_703.txt,1,0.6348980069160461,"when we were doing the free listing prompts earlier, you mentioned collections as a reason to keep things. is there anything else, i know you mentioned that you have some backpacks, but is there anything else you like to collect or have a lot of?","yeah, i mean i guess i have some shoes, like i like to collect shoes although i don’t have a ton of them but i do have several pairs that i never wear but i still hold on to them and don’t get rid of them for one reason or another. some of them are a little uncomfortable but so i, i, rarely ever wear them but i still have them in my closet, you know. so if there’s ever a space that seems more cluttered than others it would be the closet."
057,057_703.txt,1,0.6514021754264832,"are there any other parts of your room or home, i know you said earlier that it’s not excessively cluttered, but is there anywhere else where maybe you have some things piled up that you’re not using?","yeah, i don’t, i mean like inside some of my dresser drawers there’s, or my nightstand there’s like papers in there and stuff like that that i have no idea what they are. sorry-"
057,057_703.txt,1,0.5596665740013123,"what, what kind of papers?","i don’t know, they might be like financial statements or somewhat important documents but, that i don’t know what to do with or how to get rid of them or if i need them or anything like that."

057,057_704.txt,1,0.7363067865371704,"okay. so how would you distinguish what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, or hoarding disorder?","yeah i would say like if the, if the collecting goes into like, if it, if it affects functionality or if it affects other areas in your life, then that would maybe move it to hoarding. for instance if you can’t, you know, move freely within your own home, or if, if there’s even like infestations of animals or insects or things like that that you are unaware about, and i feel like that would move into kind of like a hoarding situation."
057,057_704.txt,1,0.4839501678943634,and you’ve never experienced any of these problems or had any sort of difficulties when it comes to clutter?,no.

057,057_704.txt,1,0.8053604960441589,are there any ways that you could tell if someone had hoarding disorder without being in their home?,"without being in their home? maybe if i noticed them like holding onto things that, you know, one might normally not hold onto like you know, yeah i don’t know i mean i think it would be difficult to tell if anybody was a hoarder outside of their own home."
057,057_704.txt,1,0.7101675271987915,where do you get information about hoarding disorder?,"well, let’s see, i guess i mean i’ve had personal experiences moving people out of their homes and, and they would have what i consider hoarding disorder. or i’ve also watched the shows on tlc and stuff like that where they kind of follow hoarders so that’s probably where i get most of my information i guess is-"
057,057_705.txt,1,0.6487446427345276,do you have any opinions about that show and how it depicts hoarding disorder? from any personal experiences that you’ve had?,"yeah, i mean, i think it definitely depicts them in maybe a more of a negative connotation i think even like a lot of my descriptive words for hoarding in the free list and things like that kin do portray that idea that like there’s definitely something more going on rather than just their hoarding disorder you know that it might be exacerbated by some underlying mental issue or something like that."
057,057_705.txt,1,0.35519006848335266,"so, so, yes, you mentioned so anxiety and depression. have you ever had any difficulties with any of these uncomfortable feelings and have they led you to maybe unnecessarily hold onto things in the past that would be any, like, concerning hoarding behavior? considered concerning hoarding behavior? or issues with clutter?","no, i mean i can’t, i can’t really think of anything of the top of my head."
057,057_705.txt,1,0.2801870107650757,"okay, so this was, i didn’t know, this was supposed to be an interview with people who have issues with clutter or hoarding disorder, which i know some people who have issues with clutter don’t necessarily find their behavior concerning but maybe it leads to other interpersonal problems with family or different things, but you said earlier you do not have hoarding disorder, and from talking to you i, my impression is that you don’t seem to have any issues with clutter, sorry, it’s never caused any issues with anyone in your life?",yeah that’s correct.
057,057_705.txt,1,0.6917698383331299,"okay, so i don’t know if the, if the rest of the question would apply. do you think you have too much stuff?","no, i don’t think so, i mean, we, you know we recently moved from utah to florida and so we tried to consolidate quite a bit of our stuff. so, yeah it wouldn’t, i wouldn’t necessarily say that we have too much stuff. necessary, unnecessary stuff."
057,057_705.txt,1,0.3815567195415497,"have you, okay, i’m looking over the questions. so would you say that in any way, hoarding causes any sort of issues in your daily life?",no.
057,057_705.txt,1,0.6758266091346741,okay. is there anything that you would like to change about the way that you keep or get rid of some items?,"yeah, i mean i think i would, it would be good to have, you know after having this conversation or whatever it definitely would be good to have maybe a time of the year or a couple times of the year where you go through your stuff, especially like clothes and, and shoes and things like that and kind of make that decision, you know, have i used this thing, if not, then, you know, it, it would probably be good to get rid of those things and so, maybe just having like a system in place where you kind of go through things or even renew things that have maybe worn out or you know lost their shine or whatever. i think, you know, getting rid of the old and bringing something in new might even provide some new energy in my life overall, so."
057,057_706.txt,1,0.680065393447876,"if you had to change anything now, i know you mentioned earlier that if someone made you get rid of things you would not be bothered, but if you had to change anything about your behavior now regarding clutter or keeping things, would it upset you at all, aside from, i, you mentioned the like personal sentimental items. like say, you said you have maybe some backpacks you don’t use. if your wife had you throw all of those away tomorrow would that be upsetting to you?","yeah, okay, yeah. i mean if you, if you, if i had to throw all of them away tomorrow i would probably be a little perturbed."
057,057_706.txt,1,0.33834365010261536,"have, and once again, has this impacted any sort of relationship, or have, have your issues with potential clutter impacted any sort of relationship in your life, whether its landlords, family members, romantically?","no, they haven’t."

058,058_709.txt,1,0.4265255033969879,"no, i like there's just like such a strong like sense that it's been instilled in you as a child that you just continued it",yeah like what if you need it later.
058,058_709.txt,1,0.4862164855003357,"um, how do you think your friends feel about the behavior.","um sort of saying “do you need help cleaning this?” UNCLEAR i don’t think it bothers them that much because the house isn’t dirty, it's just cluttered. and you got to head this way, and then that way. get on over there, and shut up and they know that. i wash my hands constantly, so they know i’m clean."
058,058_709.txt,1,0.559525728225708,okay.,they’ll offer but other than that.

058,058_710.txt,1,0.37296754121780396,"so you said that you, you collect a lot of papers and your houses like obviously filled with papers. and is that just because you feel like you want to read them again like?",yeah
058,058_711.txt,1,0.6418780088424683,"okay, um, and i know that you mentioned that there's papers pretty much in every part of the home. but are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way they were intended, like other than like your stove and kitchen. are there papers and just pretty much every room?",probably not in the bedroom. i don't really; that’s mostly cluttered with clothes. other than that…yeah.
058,058_711.txt,1,0.5954254865646362,yeah. what about your bathrooms?,"i have one bathroom which is actually pristine. there's nothing in that bathroom. nothing at all except the tub, the toilet, and the sink and a medicine chest with nothing but like toothbrush and toothpaste. i don’t know why."

058,058_711.txt,1,0.40037745237350464,"so, memories makes your object valuable and how do you determine if an object is valuable, or not?",oh usually if it was given to me by someone.
058,058_711.txt,1,0.45823153853416443,"okay, so if it has like sentimental value.",i'm looking around and 90% of the stuff i did not buy myself.

058,058_711.txt,1,0.4551771879196167,anything that stained with any food?,"right like, like i had soup for lunch that can that went well. it was one of those cans that you can’t recycle that and the in the garbage just came. i ran after the truck that went off with the garbage. see that i don't. 90% of what i throw out; i don't have much garbage, most of what i have is recycling."
058,058_711.txt,1,0.37442925572395325,mm hmm. okay. and what is the most precious item in your house for you?,can it be the dog or is that ridiculous?
058,058_711.txt,1,0.5715464353561401,"no, that's valid but like an object that you collect?",oh. it’s gotta be one? i like my holiday ornaments.
058,058_711.txt,1,0.5894668102264404,okay,which i need to put my christmas ones away.
058,058_712.txt,1,0.38144803047180176,"and  what would happen if you lost your christmas ornaments? like, is that something that you collect? or do you have like a quote normal amount of them?",i think it's a normal amount.
058,058_712.txt,1,0.44806617498397827,"okay. um, so what about, like all of your newspapers and papers. what happened, what would happen if you lost them?",the scary part is i wouldn't even remember it.
058,058_712.txt,1,0.4771530330181122,"um, okay. so, you don't think that you would be affected that much?",see like this so much. i wouldn't even remember it. that's how ridiculous this whole thing is okay.
058,058_712.txt,1,0.46036604046821594,and do you think that you have too much stuff?,"oh god, yeah."
058,058_712.txt,1,0.42667680978775024,and how do you decide when you have too much.,the house. it has things on places that like this chair in this den oh my god. it’s stacked up about three feet and that is not what a chair is supposed to be for. using things like the bed isn’t supposed to have
058,058_712.txt,1,0.43463918566703796,"okay, so it's going back to that like sentimental value.",like i know my sister in law gave me that and my best friend gave me that.
058,058_712.txt,1,0.45873716473579407,"okay. um, so now we'll move on to the next section, which is about distinguishing hoarding disorder. um, what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder?","i’m thinking when its not kept like it UNCLEAR its not in any organized fashion. although, i'd say i treasure all this stuff. i may have the same type of item in 10 different places and i cannot quickly find where it is like if it meant that much. why is it scattered and in such disarray? like why can’t i organize it?"
058,058_712.txt,1,0.37800243496894836,so there's just like a general sense of disorganization and not being able to find things that even though you have several of you can't locate them,right
058,058_712.txt,1,0.4134714603424072,"and is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without being in their home?",no
058,058_712.txt,1,0.5388970971107483,no?,not unless its spilled into the yard. i wouldn't think so.
058,058_712.txt,1,0.5149897933006287,"okay. um, and where do you, if you do, where do you get information about hoarding disorder like where have you heard of it?","this is ridiculous. they have a show on, have you seen hoarders?"
058,058_712.txt,1,0.3533705770969391,participant 058,"right. but to me that started out as collectors like slide pinball machines and someone, and now it's gone like scary. like i don't know, and it scares me to think it disintegrates into that. like could i do that eventually?"
058,058_713.txt,1,0.3700312376022339,"okay so i was gonna ask you, like how do you feel about that show?","it’s sad and it's scary because it didn't seem to unless this i think there’s two of them. i think there’s hoarders and there hoarding. i think there's two different ones, but to me it initially was kind of neat because it started out as collectors then it seemed to disintegrate and i thought that they start out like that. i mean, like to me what seems to start it. it's like you don't start cleaning up after your pet. and then they get another pet and then you don't clean your toilet. you know what i mean? like do they start out like me then become like that? it's kind of scary."
058,058_713.txt,1,0.3860526382923126,"so, it scares you because it shows you like what potentially you could turn into maybe?","yeah, i mean, i don't think so. but i don't know. cuz i don’t think the worst. they all seemed to have started out pretty UNCLEAR."
058,058_713.txt,1,0.4892783463001251,okay. so other than that hoarding tv show. is there any other source of information on that you got your information from?,"no, not really."
058,058_713.txt,1,0.33614325523376465,"okay. um, and then now we'll just move into our next section, which is about distress or interference. so, does your hoarding disorder; do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?",probably no
058,058_713.txt,1,0.43994882702827454,"okay. um, but does it upset you?","yeah, yeah i don't like looking around here. yeah."
058,058_713.txt,1,0.4627295434474945,and does it just…why does it upset you?,because i think eventually this has to be cleaned
058,058_713.txt,1,0.5875228047370911,oh,oh no you can’t imagine what was in that house.
058,058_713.txt,1,0.3454754948616028,"okay. um, and can you describe a time when you're recording disorder got in the way of something you really want it?","sure having someone over, i would say no. not like me being an…even intermittently working at home much UNCLEAR."
058,058_714.txt,1,0.41773736476898193,okay. so other than just like you wish that you could have like people over but that's about it?,yeah.
058,058_714.txt,1,0.4466705918312073,"okay. um, and has it ever impacted any relationships or your work?",i would say no.
058,058_714.txt,1,0.5310176610946655,okay. and would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?,"not. yes. so i want to do more is organized them rather than get rid of them, but i'm not. i think i'm almost afraid to try to organize it, because i don't know how you’d organize this."
058,058_714.txt,1,0.5676103234291077,"okay, so you're afraid of like starting to organize it just because you don't even know where you would start.",i’d suppose you would start in one room but
058,058_714.txt,1,0.43403932452201843,51okay. and why would you like to change your behavior?,because eventually it's going to be cleaned.
058,058_714.txt,1,0.4684908986091614,"okay, so it just goes back to that.","i know that sounds bizarro but eventually we all go and i thought, oh my god."
058,058_714.txt,1,0.6970762014389038,"no, i've heard that before. that makes sense.",yeah.

059,059_716.txt,1,0.42473167181015015,"okay. so, as you know, this study is investigating individual’s attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. so, the first question would be what term you prefer, when we were talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?","um, what term out of any terms."
059,059_716.txt,1,0.6114696860313416,"yeah. like some people prefer like problems with clutter, or they're fine with hoarding disorder or they…","oh, i see. okay. yeah. you can say hoarding disorder."
059,059_716.txt,1,0.5334646105766296,"22- okay, thank you. um, so now we're going to be moving on to the second part of the interview, that's much more conversational. so, i'll just be asking you questions and then you just respond with how you think. um, so the first section is just about your behavior and treatment seeking. so, could you please describe your hoarding disorder to me?","my hoarding disorder is not as severe as my family's, my mother and my grandmother’s was, but i do find that i am i don't consider myself a collector, but i consider myself more of a sorter. so, if i find something like at the goodwill, or at a garage sale or at side of the road that belongs in the family, then i feel compelled to pick it up and take it with me. i see something useful that's in the trash, then i am compelled to take it, take it out. if i find something that, if i see a good deal on something that i don't actually even need might need, then i would buy it. don't have any problem with the amount of space that i have. mostly because my husband is very strong about wanting, needing to have order. but if i were on my own, i probably would have a bit more of a chaotic collection. and also, because my husband doesn't like shopping really. he doesn’t like to go shopping, he doesn’t enjoy that. i don't go shopping or out to shops or goodwill or garage sales as much as i would if i wasn't with this partner and so i feel like my hoarding is under control. but by my by circumstance."
059,059_716.txt,1,0.49104881286621094,"okay. so, you mentioned that you have other families that also have hoarding does. do you think that that may have contributed to the development of your own hoarding disorder?","yes, definitely. definitely. and through and emotionally, through an emotional way because my mother and grandmother came out of that situation of poverty when they were growing up. and so, their attachment to it was very much out of fear of not having enough and so although i haven't ever had any experience of poverty or lack, my mom giving personalities to everything, and feeling sorry for everything, and saying about hurting his feelings has made it difficult for me to discard things."
059,059_716.txt,1,0.44543278217315674,ok so you would say that…,because it was learned emotionality
059,059_717.txt,1,0.6107375621795654,right so you would say that would attach feelings to inanimate objects to justify her saving or collecting tendencies.. and then that got caught on to you.,"yes, yeah. my grandma getting through that she just kept everything my grandma was like the fire hazard keeping all the magazines type of a person, but not because she felt sorry for him because he felt that she would need them. my mom wasn't a fire hazard person, but she had, you know. she had the little trail through that house, but, um, but all of those things had personality, everything had a personality. we've been growing out of clothes and it didn't want the clothes. it was, you know, “oh no UNCLEAR they’ll miss you.”  so, there wasn't a flow of items. it was like a backlog of items."
059,059_717.txt,1,0.5113086700439453,okay. and how long has your hoarding disorder been going on for?,"well, i’m 67 so i’d probably say maybe 50 years."
059,059_717.txt,1,0.5579519867897034,44 -okay. and i know that you've mentioned that your behavior isn't as severe. but do you believe that your behavior is a problem?,"um, i think that it is a problem. yes my behavior is a problem because i've had to move several times and it's exhausting moving. and, especially common things that are easily replaceable and multiple things. so, it’s a problem, because; whereas if i had, if i had the correct number of things, all my things would fit in all the drawers that. but there are things on the counter that could be in the cupboard or in a drawer. but there are on the counter, because there isn't room in the drawer and that's not a problem. but i mean, it doesn't need to be considered a problem. it’s work for cleaning where as if it was empty it would be easier for cleaning so it just causes more work and more slowing down, and which is unnecessary. there are already five can openers."
059,059_717.txt,1,0.3678164780139923,"17 okay. um, so you believe that your behavior is a problem because it creates unnecessary difficulties that that shouldn't be there.",and extra work extra.
059,059_717.txt,1,0.4883963465690613,"would you say that this behavior like you've gotten better through time, like your behavior, used to be more severe or…","yes, i guess my behavior would have been more severe because i was because i didn't have a partner who was who felt strongly about limits to items and adversity to shopping or stopping a car to look through a trash can."
059,059_717.txt,1,0.36681321263313293,"okay. so, you would say that you would attribute the decreasing of the severity of your hoarding disordered due to your partner because he decreases you're collecting tendencies.","yes, yeah."
059,059_718.txt,1,0.3841678202152252,and have you ever sought to change this behavior like,"so i was gonna say um just he decreases, my opportunity for hoarding."
059,059_718.txt,1,0.6296576857566833,"okay, so he decreases your opportunity.",my opportunity. yeah
059,059_718.txt,1,0.39557552337646484,and have you ever sought to change this behavior?,"yes, yes i do. i have a like a trick that i do, which is to get rid of five things. so, i try to on the weekends or on other days when there's like more time. i work sometimes. i will challenge myself to get rid of five things."
059,059_718.txt,1,0.4608427882194519,that's awesome. okay. and have you ever gone to a professional for help.,no.
059,059_718.txt,1,0.3408907353878021,"okay. um, why have you never gone to a professional for help?","well, i guess, because i guess i don't feel that much of a problem. doesn't impact me financially because my focus is on free and cheap things. and um, it doesn’t keep me up at night. it doesn’t cause me stress."
059,059_718.txt,1,0.5376673936843872,okay. like you just have you just have like a feeling like an intuition. but there's never been like any open conflict?,"no, no, no, no, but i feel like a person is thinking"
059,059_718.txt,1,0.5144750475883484,like you're being judged.,yeah. yeah.
059,059_718.txt,1,0.4345109760761261,"okay. um, so like relating to that. have you ever had conflicts with people close to you, or maybe landlords about your behavior?","well, yeah. so, my husband and sometimes like he doesn’t like to have things on the stairs. and so, i’ve got things on the stairs. so, that's kind of a constant source of irritation. and we share a walk-in closet, and i've got like three sides of the walk-in closet. more than half of the walk-in closet. so that’s; it was a source of irritation but now i think it’s just accepted as the way it is. we have things in the attic that i know i’m never gonna use again but they used to a source of"
059,059_719.txt,1,0.4572376310825348,contention?,"of tension but now it’s just accepted as “they’re there” and we have to look at them. so i know they’re there and that’s good for me, and i don’t know if knowing they’re there is bad for him. so it’s just not a source of conversation anymore."
059,059_719.txt,1,0.4825141429901123,"so just like i'm just like household conflicts but nothing, nothing greater than that.","no, not for me."
059,059_719.txt,1,0.6175481677055359,"okay. um, so now we'll move on to our second section which is about your space and living area. so, could you please describe where you live now.",i live in a house in suburban neighborhood in LOCATION_NAME.
059,059_719.txt,1,0.5267605781555176,and what’s the space like?,"oh, it’s a 1970s-open plan sort of house. with a front and back yard, side yard and swimming pool."
059,059_719.txt,1,0.706108033657074,"would you say that you have difficulty moving around, or is there like enough space for everything?","yes, there’s enough space for everything."
059,059_719.txt,1,0.5355333685874939,"okay, um. are you happy with how your house looks inside like are you happy with the amount of space that you have?","so, so it's, i think, yes. i would like there to be more space. i would like there to be more space. but i think most people would not think that its particularly cluttered. but, um, i’m sitting in this office room now and there are sewing machines on the floor. there’s shoe boxes on the floor, there’s another box on the floor and a bag of something else that’s not put away on the floor. so, there are those things that could be put away."
059,059_719.txt,1,0.6307970881462097,"how important are your things to you in order for you to feel like you're at home. so, like, in other words, how, how important are your items to you that they, in a sense, represent home?","that’s interesting. yes. so i would say that they, oh wow i’m just think like could i just walk away from these things? no, i don’t think i could do that. but when i am, but i don't feel like when i come back from being at someone else's house or being having gone on vacation. i don't feel like, oh, my thing. oh, i'm finally home with this feels right. so, so that's interesting. i think that i… kind of important."
059,059_720.txt,1,0.6053288578987122,"okay,",not as important.
059,059_720.txt,1,0.6736976504325867,"so they're not they're not like a necessity, like they don't. you don't need them all the time in order to feel comfortable.","no, i definitely don't need all the time."
059,059_720.txt,1,0.6036368608474731,okay.,"but, i know what you mean but no i don’t."
059,059_720.txt,1,0.4446200132369995,"okay. um, and which objects are most important to you and which ones do you spend a lot of time with?","um, i think maybe. i like styling these books. i’ve got these books. i’ve got books on top of books, and books in front of books. plus around the other books. and books over there. maybe, maybe it's the books. uh, yeah but i also have these baskets. and i’ve got baskets for the whole neighborhood, but nobody who's going to get any of them."
059,059_720.txt,1,0.4055948257446289,"okay, so you would say that books and baskets are the items that are most important to you.",yeah.
059,059_720.txt,1,0.7273164391517639,okay. and are there specific parts of your home that you would consider cluttered.,"i’d say that every part of my home has a corner that’s cluttered. so, there isn’t like this one room, or “i'll keep everything in that room so this room can be uncluttered.” so, like there’s pockets in every, every room."
059,059_720.txt,1,0.6465514302253723,"okay. and you would say that they are cluttered, just because there's objects that shouldn't be there or that are like in little stockpiles?","there are things, like things on the floor. that should be not on the floor."
059,059_720.txt,1,0.7392339110374451,okay. that should have their proper place and be put away.,"that should have a proper place. the proper place is not on the floor. but there isn’t a proper place. it’s not that i’m not tidy, it’s because there’s not a place."
059,059_720.txt,1,0.6653172969818115,"okay. um, are there parts of your home that you don't use so like parts of your home that aren't being used in the way that they were intended to be used?","i'm not sure what you mean by that. for example, we’ve got two bedrooms for my children who aren't here now. and i’ve resisted putting my things in there. but i could also imagine that i could take over this house because we’re an empty nest now. they're not being used for me but they’re being held for them."
059,059_721.txt,1,0.4005036950111389,but you you've resisted the urge to fill them with your items.,yeah.
059,059_721.txt,1,0.3390980064868927,"okay. um, is there anything else you can think of, like, for example, some people will not be able to use their bathtub, because there are so many objects.","oh, i see. uh, no, no, no, we’re alright for that."
059,059_721.txt,1,0.435005247592926,"okay. um, and then moving on to our next section, which is on value when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?",and i think their familiarity and their potential.
059,059_721.txt,1,0.6349628567695618,"okay. so what is trash for you, like, what do you discard?","into the trash? something that's broken or something that's dirty, or stained. something that… yeah"
059,059_721.txt,1,0.5124456882476807,"okay. and so, you've mentioned it before. um, how your books and baskets are the most precious items in your house for you. so, what would happen if you lost them?","well you know i think about that. think about sharing. if i were going to share them even just not using them and it’s like, i feel distraught about that. UNCLEAR you know, i’d rather share money you know than share these things, which is interesting. they don't have a… i guess probably they're like hard to find. so, they would be difficult to replace with money, whereas money. i work right so i can replace the money, but things that are one off, odd things. i got at thrift stores and found you know hunting hunting and gathered and found a basket or this thing in a trash can, you know, so, so the value i guess is in the acquisition of it. it’s monetary value."
059,059_721.txt,1,0.6346032023429871,"right so you value more the like the uniqueness and like, like you said, the acquisition more than more than necessarily even money.",right than the monetary value of it.
059,059_721.txt,1,0.33043405413627625,"right, okay.","like my grandma with her stack of penny saver magazines are worth zero dollars when you could not get her to part with one of them, you know."
059,059_721.txt,1,0.5720655918121338,"and like you've mentioned you are aware that you have too much stuff. um, but how do you know that, like, how do you decide when you have too much?","yes. yeah, so, um, i've got a really good system with my clothes and so that is there's a certain amount of space that is in the closet and that's how much space in the closet, there's an extra closet or not an extra place for any clothes. and so when, when that's and that's the right amount. and so, if i want to get something new and something got to come out. i don't have a problem with that. now i'm taking it more space in the closet and my husband is, i recognize that. he hasn't asked to reclaim and of the space. so, the space that i have is my space and that is the right amount of space is what fits in there is the right amount of thing. okay. but, i don't have that rule with the books. and so, the books; i can't see the books behind the books because there's books in the way. so, i see that that's too many books, but if i did get rid of five on the books out be really hard. okay, i don't think i could do that."
059,059_722.txt,1,0.5341153144836426,"okay, so for some things you have a set system, like for example your clothes. but for things that are more valuable to you, it's a little bit more difficult to realize when you have too much.","yes, yeah. well i realize that i’ve got too much but i don't have a solution for reducing and there’s no space for another bookshelf. UNCLEAR"
059,059_722.txt,1,0.6463561654090881,so the last question in this section about value is. if you had to choose between your items. how do you think you would choose?,like if i had to choose.. like if there was a fire?
059,059_722.txt,1,0.31045860052108765,pretty much. yeah.,"how would i choose? i suppose i would choose to take what i could carry. nothing that if i had to choose, i would choose on value. so probably grab take my jewelry, because even though i don't feel as emotional about that; attached to that, i feel it has more value. you know the money value. so that’s what i would choose based on money value. so i wouldn’t take my can openers."
059,059_722.txt,1,0.7107694149017334,"moving on to our next section, which is about distinguishing hoarding disorder. what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?","what’s the difference? hmm what is the difference between normal saving… so, lets see, so my sister has an ebay business and she has all the things everywhere all over the place because he's one day sort this out and do ebay on those things. and she recognizes that it feels like grandma's hoarding but she has plans for all of those things which is to sell all of those things. so that is more like saving. whereas my things i don't have any plan for. i mean i don’t even, i mean i’ve read these books and i haven't read some i know i'm never going to get to. they're like, they're all together. i'll do feeling books. they’re all good. i’ve got a good, nice collection of those. so, hoarding is when there's no plan. my grandma with her penny savers, she had a plan for those. so, she didn’t consider that to be hoarding. that was more of, she was saving those.  whereas me with no plan, i’m just hoarding. my mom as well. with her little UNCLEAR for the door to the back. i know she had no plans for any of those things."
059,059_723.txt,1,0.3781408369541168,"okay, so it's just all about the plan is how you distinguish saving from hoarding.",think so. yeah.
059,059_723.txt,1,0.5607656836509705,"um, and is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without being in their home?","well i, i, in my mind, i think that maybe somebody who’s grabby and has a difficult time sharing, i'd say i would guess that person's house was filled with junk."
059,059_723.txt,1,0.6794049739837646,"52 – okay, and where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?","um, where do i get the information? i think a few of those tv shows that; it's fascinating to see other people’s hoarding. and my sister. she's got a website, ugh well she doesn’t have a website but she’s got a blog or something, you know, about; she has a difficult time cleaning. and so, there are a lot of hoarders that have a difficult time with cleaning apparently because she shares some stories with me that she’s come across this blog, it helps people who have difficulty with cleaning. so yeah. basically, that's where i get my information, i wouldn't say that i look at journals in the same way that i do about other things,"
059,059_723.txt,1,0.4827895760536194,"um, and how do you feel about the hoarding tv show.","um, it’s fascinating like watching a car wreck. fascinating and sad."
059,059_723.txt,1,0.39016202092170715,right.,"like also, what is that called? there's a word for that. could happen to you. it's more like morbid fascination because i could get that that but i'm not. at least i’m not like that."
059,059_723.txt,1,0.439313679933548,right. and what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?,"um yeah i think i think about the path from the door to the chair and from the chair to the tv and from the tv to the bathroom because that’s how my grandma lives. and so, i think worst-case scenario."
059,059_724.txt,1,0.430467426776886,"okay. and so, finally we're entering our last section which is on distress or interference, um, does your hoarding disorder upset you like do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?","not daily. but i think that it’s something that i focus or i think about weekly. you know? like my five, get rid of five things and right now we’re talking and looking at these two big boxes on this one. books in front of books. i recently lost a lot of weight and didn’t really notice that i had all this weight and it was. and now that i don't have this weight and my clothes are really loose like gosh how i didn't even realize. that all myself. fill this thing up.  and so, now that it's gone. i see how much space right and so i feel like these books are there, they just kind of there like my hips and if i don't think about them they’re just going to stay there. so if i start moving them"
059,059_724.txt,1,0.47271689772605896,you’ll realize,"yeah there’ll be more space. i can ignore it really easily and look away from it. but if i do look at it, it causes me a problem or is a problem."
059,059_724.txt,1,0.4227445721626282,"and, could you describe a time when you're hoarding disorder in the way of something you really wanted?","how ‘bout it this? i was, we were going to go visit family and i wanted to take some pictures of our house so i could show, you know, show off where we live to our family who hadn’t seen it. so, i was walking around with the ipad looking at the pictures, looking at the scene i was going to take and thinking “oh, i don't want, i don't want them to see that.” so, you know, rather than just going into each room and snapping a picture which were taken five minutes it was hours. you know, moving the things here. so, i could have seen the great and then turning it in the other direction then i move it so that that scene looked good. then in the kitchen, moving all of this over here. moving it all in the other direction. so, its something that should have taken only; it shouldn’t have needed any thought. it took ages and ages because i would be embarrassed for them to see the pictures of it as we lived."
059,059_724.txt,1,0.6747496724128723,"i understand. okay. thank you so much. um, and our last question is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?","well i think i would be upset. yes, i would be upset, but i don't know for how long. sometimes i think about things that i got rid of and i mourn for them like “oh i wish i had; god why did we get rid of that?” especially something that wouldn’t have taken up any space. “like oh i remember i gave that away!” um, but that it was finally able to be given away. i don't remember feeling bad about the time later, i think, oh, “if only, if only.”"
059,059_725.txt,1,0.4103625416755676,it’s like the reflection about it that makes you upset.,"yeah, when i do my five things i don't, like, the next day go through and see what i got rid of, for example, i got two bags in my bedroom now on the floor and it's a collection of many days of five things, but i know i went and said “you know, what’s in here?” then half the stuff i pull out again. you know, so there’s that as well."
059,059_725.txt,1,0.5234198570251465,okay. and the very last question is would you like to change your behavior?,"yes, i would like to change my behavior. sometimes and maybe actually i can change my behavior on the acquiring side. it’s the acquisition. i’ve trained myself on the acquiring side to not stop and look at the bulging trash can. to not stop at that garage sale. to look away when somebody’s pulling out their stuff. but once it’s in that’s when it stays. that’s the hard behavior. the holding."
059,059_725.txt,1,0.3951623737812042,"and what do you think would be like the biggest benefit to you, changing your behavior like what do you think the most positive impact would be?",i think like when i go to someone else's house. has two things are for a vacation somewhere hotel or something and there’s very few personal things in the minimalist sort of space and it feels so open you know it just feels so open. and wiping down is so easy it’s not like you got to move stuff. you just wipe it down. and that's what would be that would be a psychological lift of lightness and then also a production in time. in work time.
059,059_725.txt,1,0.3875417113304138,so just like the mental relief added with just like the ease of doing things that should be quick and easy.,yeah.

060,060_728.txt,1,0.5475541353225708,"06- ok, so to start off as you know this study is investigating individual’s attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. so the first question i’d like to ask you is what term would you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding? are you ok with hoarding disorder or would you prefer another term?",no hoarding disorder is fine.
060,060_728.txt,1,0.3846186399459839,36- ok great,i mean i know why i UNCLEAR . but it is called hoarding; you can’t hide it.
060,060_728.txt,1,0.6095715165138245,"28- ok. thank you. so now we are going to be moving on to the next part of our interview which is just normal more conversational questions. so, could you please describe your hoarding disorder? how long has this been going on?","i want to say when i got into my teens because i UNCLEAR so i time everything around and then when i got married at a young age i didn’t have my stuff; i couldn’t get my stuff. there was even a time where i was actually without food, without that and i think that was when it really started.  because if i don’t keep and i don’t have it and i see it, i want it. and let me tell you i don’t know if this is me talking to you right now in this conversation but if i go to the store, i will get things i don’t need, thinking i’m going to need them later. and i know that’s hoarding because when i bring it home, it sits. you know it just sits there. so, i just wanted; you know i started in my teens. i started to accumulate stuff and then i lost stuff. i was afraid. i was afraid that i would lose the chance to get stuff i wanted when i could see it. you would actually go nuts if you came over here right now. it’s not cluttered; it is cluttered but on my desk i don’t have a desk."
060,060_728.txt,1,0.5313218832015991,ok.,i have a chair in the living room with stuff around it.
060,060_728.txt,1,0.5645759701728821,06- so you’d say that your hoarding is more because of you just want to make sure that you have everything and you don’t lose anything?,yes and i don’t lose it. you know i just want it near me. i want to be able to UNCLEAR for it.
060,060_728.txt,1,0.41423383355140686,20- and you said that this started maybe when you were in your teens?,yeah.
060,060_728.txt,1,0.4891865849494934,25- ok.,i had everything then i lost it.
060,060_728.txt,1,0.4912945628166199,30- how severe would you say that this behavior is now?,"well for me, i mean, it’s actually if i had to do a one to ten i would say maybe a seven and a half."
060,060_728.txt,1,0.4653998911380768,44- ok.,ok because ok my house could be a lot neater but i want things around me. but i would say 7 seven and a half.
060,060_729.txt,1,0.3830791711807251,"52- ok seven and a half. ok. and why would you say it’s a seven and a half like in comparison to you other, other times?","i know my other rooms, my kitchen, my bathroom, stuff like that, there’s not stuff in there. it’s neat; clean. it’s where i am all the time and it looks really piled up."
060,060_729.txt,1,0.43177303671836853,and where are you most of the time?,"well i’m in my living room and i work out of my living room. so, i work on ebay so i two big, huge bins  in the living room and i’ve got my ebay stuff stacked in the corner. i’m sitting in a chair right now, there’s a bookshelf beside me with piles. but, i know where everything is. people will look at it and say, “how do you find anything?” i put my hand right on it. but if you look in your place and say “where is that pile?”"
060,060_729.txt,1,0.5565409660339355,right,is this making sense?
060,060_729.txt,1,0.5153589248657227,yes. completely.,and i feel comfortable with my stuff around me.
060,060_729.txt,1,0.4893645942211151,"so to other people it would appear like it’s a mess, but to you it all makes perfect sense",oh yeah everything’s there.
060,060_729.txt,1,0.5178716778755188,and do you believe that your behavior is a problem?,yeah.
060,060_729.txt,1,0.3130110800266266,yeah?,yeah it actually is because i live with my husband; i live with my brother and it causes problems with other people because number one they live here and the house is cluttered with my stuff. or they can’t move around. you know the living room would be a lot bigger if i didn’t have big huge forty gallon bins in here.  but i have my ebay stuff in there. i could put it in another room but i want it here.
060,060_729.txt,1,0.512424111366272,so you believe that your behavior is a problem because it affects other people,other people UNCLEAR
060,060_729.txt,1,0.5512253642082214,if they weren’t in the equation would you want; would you consider the behavior a problem for yourself?,no. actually no. it’s comforting to me. is that fair?
060,060_729.txt,1,0.39877811074256897,i think that’s fair.,now if i had trash on the floor and you know fast food things and that yeah that would UNCLEAR but i don’t do that. i just have stuff around me. i don’t have no garbage around me.
060,060_729.txt,1,0.45438772439956665,ok. and have you ever sought to change this behavior? like gone to a professional for help?,"no. i mean no. you know what i do? i keep telling myself “one day NAME, you going to move into a bigger place. you can have this one room for your hoarding, office, clutter room.” and then it makes me feel better."
060,060_729.txt,1,0.48958590626716614,ok.,i mean i really haven’t. i mean to me i’m not that bad.
060,060_730.txt,1,0.5210083723068237,ok so you’d say that you haven’t gone to a professional because you don’t think you’re that bad and because you think that in the future you’ll just have a room to yourself.,yeah. i talk myself out of it.
060,060_730.txt,1,0.4630057215690613,ok. and i know you mentioned that your father and brother; or your husband and brother react negatively to your behavior.,"no, no i mean you can tell sometimes when they got to walk around something or when they invite people over. yeah i can feel it i’m ashamed. i kind of hurts they don’t want to do it here. and right away i don’t care who you are, first thing ill say to you when you come into my house is “hey i’m an ebay seller, i’m an etsy seller, this is my stuff. i have no office.” that’s my UNCLEAR."
060,060_730.txt,1,0.47174519300460815,ok. so would you say you’ve had any conflicts with people about your behavior?,no because i get you before you get me.
060,060_730.txt,1,0.5241742134094238,gotcha. so you immediately give them the excuse that you work for ebay?,yes. and i do actually do.
060,060_730.txt,1,0.4446518123149872,"right, right.",and something people look at me like i didn’t even care. you know? but i want to get to you first.
060,060_730.txt,1,0.4563744366168976,ok. so now we’re moving on to the area where we’re going to explore your space and living area now. so you mentioned that you live with your husband and brother. do you live with anybody else?,no.
060,060_730.txt,1,0.5258312225341797,ok. and could you des-. so you said that most of your stuff is cluttered around where you are the most.,where i am yeah.
060,060_730.txt,1,0.5501748323440552,"right. so, basically if could describe the place you would say that it’s hard to walk around sometimes?","well let’s just put it for you this way. the only way to get to my space is one way. there’s this one little walk- UNCLEAR and one time he had a chair, a regular chair that i could sit in UNCLEAR the other side of me has this bookshelf with big things in it and its filled. i even added a whole new table beside it because i ran out of room on the table.  but there’s no room. my husband has his chair which is next to me, he could only go one way out. to go around the coffee table. so, i don’t know if i answered your question but there’s only one way in and out. where i sit."
060,060_730.txt,1,0.4950968325138092,no you answered it.,it has all my stuff around it.
060,060_731.txt,1,0.6704781651496887,"other than the living room, are there any other rooms that are cluttered?","ok. i had extended; i’m looking right at UNCLEAR. i’m looking right across from me at my dining room. it’s not a dining room because i haven’t sat in there and all my personal stuff is on those shelves. my son just even my bookshelves on wheels so i can stack them in front of each other and if i need something i can just move them aside on the wheels. i just slide them. so yeah it extends into the dining room. other than that, there’s no other room."
060,060_731.txt,1,0.6546459794044495,ok.  and how important; like which objects are most important to you?,which what?
060,060_731.txt,1,0.6596981883049011,which objects are most important to you?,the most important would be things people give me. and that; i wish i knew the word i’m trying to say what that is. but that’s the things that people give me. its sentimental.
060,060_731.txt,1,0.41294732689857483,sentimental. ok.,"yeah that’s my number one thing. my daughter says, “mom take a picture of it.” uh, uh. i have balloons from twenty years ago. you know right away i felt UNCLEAR. sentimental stuff. and then i have stuff that, my next thing would be of course my work stuff, because i gotta have it around me. then the other stuff is the ones where the pain in the butt is i can’t throw nothing away. i don’t care if its string. it’ll work for something. i don’t care if it’s a broken knob on a drawer. hay, i might craft with that one day because i do like to craft. so that’s the three things."
060,060_731.txt,1,0.641526460647583,"ok. so you’d say that your most valuable items would be the sentimental items that people have given you, the things that you need for work, and your craft; things that you could potentially use for crafts.","well not crafts, its anything that right away i’ll say, “oh i can use that.”  anything that i feel can be used before i die."
060,060_731.txt,1,0.396727591753006,"ok. gotcha. are there any parts of your home that you don’t use, like rooms that weren’t, aren’t being used the way they were intended? like are there things in the bathtub or on the stove or anything?","nope. nope. that’s what i’m saying, its right here."
060,060_731.txt,1,0.4409317076206207,ok.,"you know that’s what i’m saying. i know i’m not a bonafide, certified hoarder but i can sure, you know, stand among the people."
060,060_731.txt,1,0.46634554862976074,gotcha. um ok. so now we are going to go to the section that talks about value. so you mentioned that sentimental items are really valuable to you. and why do you think that is?,"very simple, somebody gave me something. and i know how i feel when somebody gives me something. i expect you to keep it. its just the fact that, you know, i love you enough to do that. so that’s why i feel that i want to portray to somebody else that i really appreciate that. you get that balloon out, i wanna keep it. so, you know what i do that’s strange. somebody will give me a balloon for mother’s day, i’ll let that thing fly until it hits the ground. it’ll be december and that thing is still flying until it hits the ground. then i’ll cut it and i’ll hold it away."
060,060_732.txt,1,0.6273415684700012,yup.,"so, that’s what i do."
060,060_732.txt,1,0.7528125643730164,ok. and what is trash for you? like what do you discard?,"oh trash. stuff that’s dirty, smelly, broken, i don’t keep nothing broken."
060,060_732.txt,1,0.593812882900238,ok. so anytime its actually considered trash you will throw it away.,"yeah. i mean yes, yeah i’m not going to keep something like that."
060,060_732.txt,1,0.49341118335723877,ok. and do you think you have too much stuff?,yes.
060,060_732.txt,1,0.2994830012321472,how do you know that?,"actually yes. i really, it’s something my daughter said “mom, take a picture of it. then you can have all they nice pictures and you won’t have all this stuff in your drawers.” and stuff like that. you know but i still at sometimes, i like looking at it. i don’t want to pull up a picture. here’s another thing. i think what shocks me, in my lifetime my family has lost photos twice in our life. once they were stolen, and once they were left behind. you can’t get pictures back from grandmothers."
060,060_732.txt,1,0.41125059127807617,so you’d say that a reason why you,pictures are crap
060,060_732.txt,1,0.5331565141677856,keep your things so much is that you don’t; you can’t rely on photos.,you know what else i hoard. now that you make me; files on my computer. you know i don’t just have a pile of pictures. i’ll take my pictures and i’ll put them in a file. i put them on a cd and i put them on a thumb drive. believe it or not in three places.
060,060_732.txt,1,0.6600532531738281,hmm. just because you…,so that’s
060,060_732.txt,1,0.6645522713661194,can’t trust physical photos.,yup. that was a UNCLEAR . that’s a trigger. i don’t want to lose my pictures again.
060,060_732.txt,1,0.41552507877349854,"right. ok. if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?",oh man now you got me upset. that triggers
060,060_732.txt,1,0.6895514726638794,i’m sorry. would you like to skip that question?,"that was unnecessary. why did it do that? why did that question do that? i don’t like to be… i’m okay, i’m okay."
060,060_732.txt,1,0.2763364613056183,we can skip it.,"no, no, no, no. that’s okay. i don’t like to be told to choose. you know, because it’s like i’m afraid you’re going to say, “would you choose your family or your stuff.”"
060,060_733.txt,1,0.5523762702941895,right.,that’s what i was afraid you’re gonna say.
060,060_733.txt,1,0.6298344135284424,oh no.,to that question i can’t even answer
060,060_733.txt,1,0.5743281841278076,no no,they’re my family. they’re all i got.
060,060_733.txt,1,0.4242587089538574,59: hmmm.,"so, yeah, i can’t even answer that. wow what a question. wow. well that made me feel stupid."

060,060_733.txt,1,0.6385257840156555,ok.,it’s all important to me.
060,060_733.txt,1,0.44229111075401306,right.,"if i get rid of this, that’s my business. if i get rid of that, that’s my sentimental stuff. so, nothing’s going you know."
060,060_733.txt,1,0.574532151222229,ok.,i just need to get UNCLEAR that’s the thing that UNCLEAR me.
060,060_733.txt,1,0.3326266407966614,"36: right. ok. so now we are going to move on to the section about distinguishing hoarding disorder. so, what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?",you’re asking me?
060,060_733.txt,1,0.5257329344749451,"yes, like what’s the difference between someone just wanting to save something and someone who has hoarding disorder?","well i can answer that one because before i got really, really bad i used to love black and white cows. but when i would collect them i had a certain place for them. they we like in glass things. i mean i had every cow thing there was. i kept them in a certain place. they weren’t all over. and then there’d come a time where i had to leave because we had a mold situation in one of our houses. it didn’t bother me. ok? hoarding, i mean i got upset the minute you asked me what was more important."
060,060_733.txt,1,0.5241227746009827,right.,yup. that upset me. everything’s important.
060,060_733.txt,1,0.5203940868377686,"ok. so, you’d say…",that’s the difference my reaction.
060,060_733.txt,1,0.35344746708869934,go ahead. so you’d say the main difference between normal behavior and hoarding disorder is that saving behavior there is not as much of an emotional attachment but whereas with hoarding disorder there is.,yes. you know yeah. its mental. that’s where your mental thing comes in.
060,060_733.txt,1,0.7257786989212036,is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?,"you know something? this is really weird like if you see them outside your house; like we’ll be driving around, we’ll be in a parking lot. i can tell who’s a hoarder by their car. their dash is just like everything. they have tons of crap in their car and i’ve seen it with my whole family. my car gets like that. in my van, i have a box that shouldn’t be in there but it’s got books to read if i have to wait, it’s got a crossword puzzle. something’s in there that shouldn’t be in there. but i want it there. you know? so, that’s one way. another way too, i noticed how people dress. you’ll see some people with 10-12 necklaces on and bracelets because they can’t decide what they want to do. i notice is a lot, you know, with people and they’re all hoarders. because i’ve met them and talked to them. and they’ll tell me “i didn’t know what to wear.” so, that’s the only thing i’ve got for you."
060,060_734.txt,1,0.307679146528244,"ok, so you can spot if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their homes based on how their car looks, like the interior of their car and how people dress because it conveys a sense of undecidedness.",yeah undecided that’s the word. thank you.
060,060_734.txt,1,0.49791786074638367,mhm. ok let’s see. where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?,"actually, i don’t because i never thought it was a problem of mine. i actually didn’t start to think about hoarding until my daughter was very, very depressed. not now she isn’t, but she retired not this january but last january here at the library. you would have saw her house that’s what said, we’ll talk about her after this, UNCLEAR  wasn’t raised the way she was living. and she was UNCLEAR, her expression you know, then i’d try to read up on depression hoarding and stuff like that. that’s how i thought about me. so, i felt like i was a hoarder. i would have thought i was a saver. so, a saver is not a hoarder."
060,060_734.txt,1,0.4122507572174072,true.,you know? i save things but if you over-save things you cross the fence.
060,060_734.txt,1,0.5003356337547302,so did you do most of your reading from internet sources or books?,"internet. talking to people. i’m a very talkative person. i’ll talk to people in line. stuff like that. yeah, i really researched. oh my god i’m a big research person. i research everything. so, yeah. it’s something i like to do."
060,060_734.txt,1,0.5656822919845581,"so, you first heard of hoarding disorder from reading about it, you said?","no, my daughter. and the therapist labeled her as a hoarder. this was oh my god about 10 years ago. so that’s when her depression got really bad. and i just never really heard UNCLEAR . about ten years ago. hoarders and i used the logic i was like oh my god such pigs. but then i look at me and go NAME such a pig. you know? but at least i didn’t have the garbage. i felt lucky. and you can open my front door, because at my daughter’s you can’t. man, you could not. she had to crawl over. just imagine. oh yeah"
060,060_735.txt,1,0.4507576525211334,and what do you think about when you hear the words “hoarding disorder”?,you’re breaking up.
060,060_735.txt,1,0.6140102744102478,can you hear me?,"ok so you’re breaking up, so i don’t know if it’s you or…"
060,060_735.txt,1,0.6189205646514893,ummm,now you’re ok.
060,060_735.txt,1,0.43011966347694397,ok good.  what do you think about when you hear the words “hoarding disorder”?,"UNCLEAR . and i don’t consider myself mental. i really don’t. i’m not depressed. i used to have major anxiety but it’s kind of controlled now. i’m a very happy person, really, i am. so mentally ill. that’s it."
060,060_735.txt,1,0.38126710057258606,ok.,"i used to think pig. you know, trashy people. i used to think that before my own daughter became one. and i knew she wasn’t. and i knew where it came from."
060,060_735.txt,1,0.514441967010498,so it was that personal connection that changed your insight.,yeah. other than that i was like “oh my god you slob.” so that changed real quick.
060,060_735.txt,1,0.5528221130371094,ok. and now we are moving into the last section of our interview which talks about distress and interference of hoarding disorder that will have in your daily life. so does your hoarding disorder upset you? do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?,"ugh. not per say get in my way. no, it doesn’t. it just causes anxiety sometimes because i’ll wake up sometimes and “oh my god, what a mess.” i love… i was raised in a clean house.  and it’s you know, my mother, my mother would fall over if she saw this. UNCLEAR. i’m sorry about that, i keep, i keep making you think it’s really bad but it’s not really. i don’t know i don’t have an answer to that."
060,060_735.txt,1,0.481945276260376,"so you don’t, you wouldn’t say that it gets in the way of your daily life.",no because my other rooms are fine.
060,060_735.txt,1,0.616773247718811,ok.,my yard’s fine. my porch is fine.
060,060_735.txt,1,0.6084780097007751,could you think of a time where your hoarding disorder got in the way of something you wanted?,"now that i think is a good one. a few times i was looking for something that should not have been put where it was. when you’re looking for something important, you look and look and look. then you cause anxiety. then you start getting angry. then the people around start feeling your anger and it starts arguments. like “why’d you put it there, it wasn’t there before.” you know. yeah that’s the only time it ever got in my way. because i was careless  and didn’t put something actually where it was supposed to go."
060,060_736.txt,1,0.285290390253067,"and then that brings up, so not finding something brings up all the feelings of anxiety. which just turns into a whole other mess.",yeah.
060,060_736.txt,1,0.5150805115699768,"ok. so i know i asked this earlier, and you said that your husband and brother aren’t really; they don’t really negatively say anything about it. but has it ever upset any of your loved ones?","no it doesn’t. not so much my husband because he still; my husband’s not a hoarder, he just a slob. i’ll tell you what he is, he’s just a slob."
060,060_736.txt,1,0.6944512128829956,he’s just a slob?,yeah. he’s not a hoarder.
060,060_736.txt,1,0.35258522629737854,ok.,"my brother is neat, but he’s just compassionate towards me. but i’ve seen his once is a while like you know, you can’t get through. i remember one time he invited my nephew and his wife and kids and there was nowhere for them to sit and he got kind of upset like god we have nowhere for anyone to sit in this house. and it made me feel bad because i have plastic chairs everywhere. so, i kind of, if i know he’s having someone over, i’ll just gather my stuff up and just dump it somewhere."
060,060_736.txt,1,0.439473032951355,right.,"UNCLEAR. so yeah, other than that i try not to, i try to make sure that i do wish [unclear.]"
060,060_736.txt,1,0.4191204607486725,ok. and has it ever impacted any relationships like romantically or familial? or like with work?,"oh no, no. nope i’m very good UNCLEAR. no"
060,060_736.txt,1,0.3443714678287506,ok. and would you like to change your behavior?,"you know, i so would. i would love to be able to be that person. my son is like this. he could take a room and put things in its place and never lose one item. he’s one of those people if you haven’t used it in a year, you don’t need it. so that was the only thing. he tried to help me a few times and he goes “mom, you really need this.” so what i did was i just sat away and UNCLEAR. and i did get rid of some stuff, i was really proud."
060,060_736.txt,1,0.47285428643226624,good.,"but you know. no i mean, i don’t know if i answered your question. i got off track."
060,060_736.txt,1,0.4559849798679352,no you’re ok.,my son is totally different from the rest of us.
060,060_737.txt,1,0.4871101975440979,so you would like to change your behavior?,"yeah, i really would like to be that, organizer. that’s what i want to use. i would want to be an organizer. i’ve watched a few youtube videos on it. you know, that one chinese lady. just to see how you do this. you know? so yeah i would."
060,060_737.txt,1,0.5565615296363831,"ok. so, i know you mentioned that you would; that you like are very attached to your sentimental and your nostalgic items. so, would you be upset it you had to get rid of some of your items? like if something happened…","i wouldn’t want to throw myself of a bridge. i have no wedding pictured whatsoever because mold got on them. but what it was it made me mad it didn’t make me hurt. you know? so that didn’t hurt that bad. so anytime i hear “NAME you can’t have this” i would actually get upset and say let me deal with it first. and i would try to shove as much stuff as i could in less containers. seriously, i would. i would work it out some way. see that would upset me."
060,060_737.txt,1,0.40194544196128845,ok.,"but not make me, you know, want to kill myself."
060,060_737.txt,1,0.4346931576728821,gotcha.,it would just make me; it would make your life uncomfortable. but that way.
060,060_737.txt,1,0.576137900352478,"ok. so, that was the last question. so, now we just need to get some demographics. so, what is your gender identity?","female, straight. is that how you say it?"
060,060_737.txt,1,0.5090640187263489,yeah. ok. was that your sex…,i know what i am.

060,060_737.txt,1,0.37816321849823,ok.,after three years of law school and then you go to santa fe. that kind of hurt my chances.
060,060_738.txt,1,0.5422584414482117,"right. ok. and then finally, would you prefer an electronic or like an amazon gift card sent to you electronically or would you prefer a physical gift card sent in the mail.",no you do it email or whatever.

062,062_739.txt,1,0.3737909197807312,"okay, so as you know, this study is investigating individual behaviors and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. the first question would be: what term do you prefer when we refer to your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?","oh, anything you want to call it is fine."
062,062_739.txt,1,0.4813767671585083,"that’s completely up to you! some patients don’t care and just call it hoarding disorder, some patients call it clutter, so whatever you prefer.","well, clutter, because it’s not that i’m trying to keep things  incoherent going through them."
062,062_739.txt,1,0.5065885782241821,"okay so, difficulties with clutter would be your preferred term.",yes.
062,062_739.txt,1,0.6366642117500305,"so, can you please describe your clutter problems and how long this has been going on?","well i mean i’ve always been messy and cluttered, even when i was a child, you know, i would just stuff things in the drawers and whatever. and i’m pretty sure my mom suffered from some form; she would always have all these stacks of newspapers around and things. but she was not as messy and that sort of thing as i was, but i was always just sort of lazy. lazy is the prime reason that i’m this way, and secondarily, i look at all these piles, and like i said, i get kind of scared and then i don’t want to deal with it, and i’ll put it off, and pretty soon i’ve done nothing for months, you know, that sort of thing."
062,062_739.txt,1,0.6163851022720337,so you mentioned being scared. could you elaborate more on what scares you about these piles of things that you’ve accumulated over time?,"i don’t know, just having to start going through them and… i don’t know that it’s boring, but it’s really abhorrent to me. i don’t know why i don’t want to deal with it, and you know, it’d be so much easier if i either say folded clothes and put them away or dealt with things immediately after getting them or putting them in their place, but then there’s so many things too that come in that pile up and you know, i kind of spend a lot of time in the front room, so everything kind of winds up in the front room."
062,062_739.txt,1,0.4148801863193512,"right, right. it’s always nice to have someone to help you.","yeah, like this 1-800 got junk? commercials look really appealing."

062,062_740.txt,1,0.4674089848995209,"have you ever had conflicts with other people close to you that aren’t family members, like landlords or other people?","oh no, thank god. no, that hasn’t been a problem. it’s been family because most of it is, well, in the home is cluttered."
062,062_740.txt,1,0.5565801858901978,"right. so speaking of your home, the next section of questions i have is about your space and your living area, and how you see your home. can you describe where you live now?",well i live in a single family home. i live with my husband and one of my adult daughters. it’s in a suburb and… oh go ahead..
062,062_740.txt,1,0.4361608326435089,"no, no, no, i was just going to ask, what is the space like?","it’s a small home. it’s got about 900 square feet, and technically there are three bedrooms. they’re very small and, you know, there’s a lot of stuff in this house, and some of it is is co-collected by my husband or there’s other things, and i’m not responsible for that room right now, although some of it is my stuff."
062,062_741.txt,1,0.5411474704742432,"so he keeps stuff in there too, it’s not just you.","he does. yeah, and i have to say, he… you know we bought one of these electric fireplaces sort of units, and oh this is nice, and he happens to work at a home improvement store, so he bought another one that we’re not using now, and he stuffed it in my daughter’s bedroom. and then, you know, we were talking about needing a fan so we bought an indoor air conditioning unit, not just a fan, which got stuffed in my daughter’s bedroom, unopened. and we also have, he picked up where he works, an actual window air conditioning unit which is sitting here in the front room. so, some of this clutter is his! but most of it’s mine because i just turn my crap on top of it. so, yeah, there’s some times, like the front room here is the most cluttered, and it’s mostly my stuff, and it’s like clothes sitting on top of boxes, you know, one of which is…."
062,062_741.txt,1,0.6207607388496399,*phone call hangs up*,i’m sorry! i didn’t know what happened!
062,062_741.txt,1,0.5699604749679565,i think the call dropped or something! i think it dropped when you were saying about clothes being piled up on top of boxes and such.,"yes, that’s right, that was most of it, yes, and the boxes of both air conditioners are here, and opened and unopened boxes of stuff. and camping equipment and a wheelchair and other stuff."

062,062_741.txt,1,0.4766668379306793,"right, so just a little less cluttered so that you could entertain more?","yeah, because it’s embarrassing for both my husband and me. we never have people here because it’s just cluttered and no place to sit and well i’m not great at housekeeping either."
062,062_741.txt,1,0.585144579410553,how important are your things for you to feel at home in your space?,"you know, i feel good that i have the things that i do, and you know, i’m trying not to get more things. you know, it’s nice that i have them, i don’t… you know, the only things that worry me may be perhaps like a fire or something like that."
062,062_741.txt,1,0.6977548599243164,are there things that you keep that have sentimental value or?,"yeah, a lot of it is sentimental value like, well various items and stuff that i’ve had from my youth or stuff that was handed down to me or things that i collect like, you know, “say i like led zeppelin so i collected all the.. he put out a new album several years ago, so i collected all that, and i have a few books, and or say other books that i have about cartooning or disney or something like that."

062,062_742.txt,1,0.6677435636520386,"like the kitchen is used for cooking, the bathtub, and stuff like that…","yeah, all that stuff is used, yeah. it’s not cluttered so much that… the kitchen is pretty okay. it’s a little cluttered, but it’s fully usable and so is the bathroom. yeah, it’s mostly the front room here."
062,062_742.txt,1,0.5228848457336426,"yeah, so one room of just clutter then.",yeah.
062,062_742.txt,1,0.6880907416343689,"okay, so now this section of questions is about how you value your possessions. so i know that you mentioned that your pictures and your files are what you hold most dear, but when you think about all of your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?","mostly either the things that you can’t replace or… oh yeah the files are included because that’s all years and years and years of work which is like artwork or things that i value. yeah, so the most difficult ones are, you know, your photos which are family things, which you can’t just buy; you can’t replace them."
062,062_742.txt,1,0.5140683054924011,irreplaceable memories.,yeah.
062,062_742.txt,1,0.7361636757850647,"right, so what do you consider trash? i know you mentioned getting rid of things is hard for you, but what type of items do you discard?","a lot of old papers, which i generally have to do that every year for income taxes, going through papers and stuff. and that’s not as hard as going through things like piles of clothes. so what i try to trash is stuff that’s old, meaning that you can’t use it anymore, things that i’m not using anymore. and not everything gets trashed because some things we give to, like there’s a local goodwill type of thing, you know, so if there’s like clothes or other things that people can use, we gather those together periodically and bring those to that local place. but otherwise it’s paperwork, clothes that i’m not using or don’t fit…"
062,062_743.txt,1,0.4640905559062958,okay. 2,"there’s a lot of potential trash here too, that i’m not going through."
062,062_743.txt,1,0.4364984631538391,"well aside from the people in it and my puppy dog.. precious, the most precious item in my house… just one?!",if you can choose one. 2
062,062_743.txt,1,0.5244495868682861,just the things that capture the memories.,2
062,062_743.txt,1,0.5760974884033203,"do you think you have too much stuff? i know that you mentioned the clutter, it’s a lot, but how do you know you have too much stuff?","well because kind of the house is overflowing with it, like, you know, even in terms of  incoherent closet, and i hate going through that, but i guess i’m going to have to go through that again too because it’s like all these old medicines and things, but anyway there’s not even enough room to put towels in there and sheets, and sometimes they overflow out here and…"
062,062_743.txt,1,0.4913383424282074,that’s how you know you have too much stuff.,yes.
062,062_743.txt,1,0.5939470529556274,"okay. so now i’m just going to ask you a couple questions about distinguishing hoarding disorder. what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?","well collecting is more of an organized activity, where you know everything you have, you kind of may have lists of it, and you store them together in an orderly fashion."
062,062_744.txt,1,0.4157160520553589,"okay, so it’s just more orderly, you know what you have.",2
062,062_744.txt,1,0.4536857008934021,"okay, so organization is definitely a big thing.",2
062,062_744.txt,1,0.6506561040878296,"right, so i know i asked you how you can tell if someone has hoarding disorder in the beginning. so you mentioned that it’s messy and they have trouble getting rid of things, so how is that the same or different from your behavior?","i think it’s the same. i mean, i have trouble getting rid of things for whatever reason, and it’s a big mess, and it’s very apparent, and it’s in the way of, you know, life here, and it’s pissing people off."
062,062_744.txt,1,0.3019859492778778,thank you!,"perhaps, i mean i carry like a little fanny pack as my purse, and it’s usually stuffed. although, i don’t have a problem emptying out the garbage and that sort of stuff periodically from it. so i don’t know if you could infer that if somebody has… you know… a purse stuffed with stuff… i don’t know!"
062,062_744.txt,1,0.38455432653427124,"i don’t know either, but i know it’s a female’s prerogative to carry a purse, so.","you would think that a person who has hoarding disorder, their car would be disorganized. it’s full of trash and all this stuff."
062,062_744.txt,1,0.6081517338752747,"okay, so their car could be a way to tip someone off that someone may have hoarding disorder.","it could be, but if you look at my car, it’s fine. i don’t keep crap in it that shouldn't be there, and i don’t pile trash in there either, so."
062,062_744.txt,1,0.4189262092113495,"okay, so where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?",maybe online or i like to watch a lot of medical or such type programs on tv.
062,062_744.txt,1,0.6102209687232971,can you give me a couple of examples of these shows that you watch?,"well i don’t watch, maybe because it’s painful! there’s this show i think called “hoarding” or “the hoarders” or something like that."
062,062_744.txt,1,0.4620530605316162,"right, i think i’ve heard of that one.","yeah, and i’ve watched one or two of those, and, you know, you would think i’m a hoarder from watching that. although, we can mostly  incoherent in this one room!"
062,062_744.txt,1,0.41906800866127014,"so would you say compared to the extreme cases on those shows, would you have less clutter than them?",yes.
062,062_745.txt,1,0.5546773672103882,"okay, and what do you think about when you hear the words “hoarding disorder?”","i think, you know, somebody who has a uh…. well for a lack of a better term, mental problem, and, you know… i don’t know, because these people are hanging on to things because they can’t get rid of them, and mine is more like i’m too lazy to go through and get rid of stuff. i don’t generally have a problem disposing of things or getting rid of things, unless it’s something that, you know, either has memories or it’s something that i’m collecting. yeah so, i don’t know if i’m just lazy and don’t want to do it.. i don’t know!"
062,062_745.txt,1,0.5783200860023499,"okay, so in our last section, i just have a couple more questions for you. do your problems with clutter upset you?","yeah. it upsets me, you know, because we can’t really have people in here to have like a dinner party or anything. there’s no room. it upsets my family. it gets in the way of everything, you know, it always pisses my husband off, and he gets pissed off at enough things, you’d think i'd be able to control this to where it’s one less thing he’d be pissed about."
062,062_745.txt,1,0.4788942039012909,"right, so you mentioned that it gets in the way of everything, so would you say it gets in the way of your daily life?","not so much, you know, if we vacuum around it, but you know, it’s in the way because the room cannot be used the way it’s supposed to be used. there’s not enough room in it with all the clutter in it on top of things, and it just looks disorganized and messy and, you know, you don’t really want to have visitors or friends come over. i look at other people’s houses and they’re all clean and lovely and lots of space and no problems. and i look at my front room and it's embarrassing! and it looks like i’m, for lack of a better word, trailer trash or something. yeah it is a better word! my daughter’s here!"
062,062_745.txt,1,0.5441268086433411,so could you describe a time where your clutter got in the way of something you really wanted? i know you mentioned that it’s difficult to entertain and have people over because it’s embarrassing to you.,"well more importantly than being embarrassing, the way that i couldn’t house my daughter here the way that would be best for everyone was really impacting the lives of everyone else in this house, so that was a big impact for about a week here."
062,062_745.txt,1,0.47607478499412537,so definitely it gets in the way of your family time.,"and just being an eyesore, you know, the fact that my husband can’t stand it. it’s just all around bad."
062,062_745.txt,1,0.6172454357147217,"okay, and has your clutter ever impacted your work?","yeah, because, you know, my work space is kind of papers all over the place, and they’ve continually told me, many times, to keep my workspace organized and clean. and it's like, but i know where everything is here! but i could’ve cleaned it up more, i didn’t need all those papers around at all times."
062,062_746.txt,1,0.6119922399520874,so would you be upset if you hid to get rid of some of your items?,not general items. if it’s stuff that i’ve collected or have sentimental attachment to i would be upset.
062,062_746.txt,1,0.3631848394870758,"so if it’s just something lying around the house that doesn’t have any emotional attachment, then you would be okay getting rid of it?",yeah.
062,062_746.txt,1,0.4994814991950989,"okay, so that was actually my last question for you. so now i’m just going to ask you a couple of demographic questions just so we have that. so my first one is; gender identity?",female.
062,062_746.txt,1,0.6587028503417969,your sex assigned at birth?,female
062,062_746.txt,1,0.6470217108726501,your race?,caucasian
062,062_746.txt,1,0.6267348527908325,ethnicity? do you identify as hispanic or latino?,"no, i identify as jewish actually. well actually, ethnically, i’m 99.7!"
062,062_746.txt,1,0.5527438521385193,"okay, and general household income? you can give me a range.","100,000 a year."
062,062_746.txt,1,0.6149032115936279,okay and your geographic region?,west.
062,062_746.txt,1,0.5340426564216614,and your highest level of education?,"aa degree, associates degree."
062,062_746.txt,1,0.7018694281578064,"right, and would you prefer an electronic amazon gift card by email or physical gift card? i do have to say that if you do choose a physical gift card, it could take up to 3 to 4 weeks to get to you because of covid.","right, email gift card is fine."
2001,2001_000.txt,0,0.4204659163951874,"and one of the things that i wonder about is is it a delusional disorder, like--","it's very interesting you bring that up because i was just this morning at a meeting at the association of prosecuting attorneys working with a judge who i've worked with on a number of hoarding cases, and she just had a case of a client who was charged with animal hoarding, i forget all the details but i believe it was quite a few dogs--more than 30--but he was found not competent based on a delusion."
2001,2001_001.txt,0,0.36485928297042847,do you think that that's fair?,"i think it shows great insight, it shows a much higher level of understanding i think of the thought processes of a hoarder than i normally see from clinicians who don't really recognize what's going on."
2001,2001_001.txt,0,0.3331088125705719,"one is insight into the actual physical situation and how bad it is, and the other is insight into the way that it could be interfering with one's life and kind of separating those out.","that's absolutely right, and usually one of the things we see in probably i think in about 25% of the animal hoarding cases is we do have an impact on others in their care, either dependent adults or children."
2001,2001_002.txt,0,0.6392127275466919,"and i guess in cases of animal hoarding, i remember you talking about in our last conversation that sometimes people will actually have social networks or people who are kind of supporting them in their behavior, and how does that work with this kind of delusional almost aspect of...does it become a shared delusion?","almost a shared delusion, like we've had--in the case of our rescue hoarders, which are our most common large-scale hoarding situations, so people who at least present themselves or describe themselves as rescuers and sometimes actually formerly have a non-profit status and claim to be a rescue organization, and when they do come in conflict with the law or are charged with animal cruelty, many of the enablers or people who have assisted them will show up at their hearings and their trials and will also have the same level of denial."
2001,2001_002.txt,0,0.39201369881629944,do you have any knowledge of how that gets built?,well usually these are fellow hoarders.
2001,2001_002.txt,0,0.43796783685684204,so it almost appears to be a community in some cases?,"well, and that's something that's also i think unique to animal hoarders."
2001,2001_003.txt,0,0.7697599530220032,"can you ever think of a case of an animal hoarder who gained a degree of insight over time, or who came to understand their behavior differently?","i've heard of one or two people who have particularly, if they have other complicating factors like other anxiety disorders or depression, i've heard of a few hospitalized hoarders who after some pharmacological interventions briefly seemed to show some insight like, ""why is it i have so many animals?"" and yet, they relapsed."
2001,2001_003.txt,0,0.6250510811805725,"are they different expressions of the same impulse, or are they totally different?","they're not totally different, but there are different things--and there is some literature, you know randy frost has written some stuff on the distinction between the two."
2001,2001_004.txt,0,0.6043152213096619,so there's high comorbidity of depression or with object hoarding often.,"right, right, we certainly do see a number of different potential co-morbidities."
2001,2001_005.txt,0,0.333556205034256,so they kind of personify or over-empathize with objects.,"right, whereas actually letting an animal go is actually killing it or potentially killing it, the greatest anxiety a lot of the animal hoarders have is their animals will be taken away and euthanized, and the reality is it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophesy because the animals deteriorate."
2001,2001_005.txt,0,0.3836051821708679,"it does sound like you see them as different kinds of the same thing, or at least of existing on a spectrum.","right, right, the depth of potential attachment to an animal is obviously much stronger, and then in terms of being the public health aspect as i said, you know, animals pee and poor and reproduce and die, which your toasters don't."
2001,2001_006.txt,0,0.632279634475708,"so perhaps the reason we could speculate--and cut me off if you think that this is wrong--but we could speculate that maybe part of the reason that the rate of recidivism tends to be so high with animal hoarding and insight tends to be so low, while it is in object hoarding i think it's uniquely low in animal hoarding, could perhaps be because it requires so much more investment in terms of keeping the animals, so much more investment in the beliefs about the animals and also the animals kind of give back more than objects.","yeah the animals give back more and in terms of the emotional investment, again i wasn't necessarily trained or all that familiar with self-psychology, i've talked to a number of people that that's their main focus, but i certainly see it as--and when we teach responders in how to deal with animal hoarders, we have to respect the fact that this is the core of their being."
2001,2001_007.txt,0,0.5357014536857605,"so, maybe some degree of ownership of animals helps to kind of mitigate that distress that they experience and also helps--go ahead.","we don't have data to necessarily support that, it makes sense but if often puts us into conflict with sometimes the animal advocates say, ""this person did horrible things to animals and they should never be allowed to have any animals again."""
2001,2001_007.txt,0,0.4197036921977997,or have you seen them in treatment?,"a few, and it's still rare that you get compliance and part of the problem too is that if the situation is really quite severe, so they've been unable to provide for the animal's medical needs and spay/neuter needs and proper diet and so on, often they're on public assistance or medicare or whatever and often there are limits to what public systems will provide in terms of psychological assessment, maybe 8-12 visits, well that's not enough."
2001,2001_008.txt,0,0.32854580879211426,"that seems to be something that's a little bit different than with object hoarding is, while there's these dsm-v criteria that are applied that are applied to individuals to see if they are individuals with hoarding disorder, but it seems that process of diagnosis happens quite infrequently with animal hoarding, it tends to be a situation where there either is or is not legal intervention necessary and that's as far as it goes.","did i send you, or i can send you if you don't have it the article that NAME and i wrote on case outcomes in--"
2001,2001_008.txt,0,0.5556888580322266,"no you didn't but i would love it, yeah",do you have it?
2001,2001_008.txt,0,0.5710017085075378,"no, i can look it up though but i would love it if you could send it to me, i spoke to NAME.","yeah i definitely will send it to you, it's now probably we really should revisit that because obviously we're much farther down the road, i should talk to NAME about re-doing it, it was a little difficult to put together obviously as a follow up."
2001,2001_009.txt,0,0.5326774716377258,"well it sounds like maybe it's moving in the same direction as object hoarding disorder, maybe like five or ten years ago where it's starting to be moved form this kind of like marginalized, criminalized behavior-oriented, punishment-oriented thinking towards more mental illness treatment-oriented thinking and so perhaps there will be more.","as a big difference though in object hoarding, let's say you have really messy hoarding situations, at worst that's usually going to be a civil intervention, if law gets involved it's going to be violations or code violations or so-on, it's not a criminal case; whereas with animal hoarding, if animals are dying that's criminal and that's the big difference."
2001,2001_010.txt,0,0.5766182541847229,do you think that hoarding disorder or that animal hoarding is going to be brought out or should be brought out as an official sub-type with it's own diagnostic criteria in the dsm?,"you know, i don't think--it's an interesting question because as a practical measure in how we respond it clearly is different, it requires different resources to address in terms of the underlying psychology, there probably are differences because of the reciprocal nature of the attachment to the animals as opposed to objects, whether or not that is different enough to make it a totally different diagnosis i don't know."
2001,2001_010.txt,0,0.32627108693122864,"and that there aren't that many clinical experts anyway and you wouldn't find somebody who's an expert in the treatment of animal hoarding disorder in any case, this doesn't exist.","exactly, right and randy frost doesn't want any more referrals LAUGHS."
2001,2001_011.txt,0,0.3297591507434845,"we talked in the beginning of the interview about the reasons that people give for keeping their animals or for hoarding animals, and i wonder if in your mind those reasons are actually what is driving their behavior, or are those reasons kind of a post-hoc justification for what is a kind of fundamental underlying need to--?","yeah, i think that's closer to the reality partly because of the actual situation."
2001,2001_012.txt,0,0.5713925361633301,"is it something that the person has been at risk for their whole life even when they're children, or is it something that develops abruptly at a certain age?","i think it seems to be, the literature seems to be moving in the direction that there are pre-dispositions that often show up in adolescents or even the twenties seem to become perhaps solidified a bit by mid thirties and obviously increases with age, and one of the things we haven't talked about is also as with collecting and object hoarding and so on, there is a spectrum to where you know everybody has some degree of clutter, everybody collects some things or other and everybody sometimes sees uniqueness in some of the stuff they have that other people might not see."
2001,2001_012.txt,0,0.22485128045082092,"well so that's a question because you're not, so with object hoarding as well there is this sense even among clinicians of the best way to know if somebody is a hoarder is to look at how much stuff they have, and it's striking to me that there really aren't other disorders in general where you would diagnose a person by looking at something external to them, how much they've accumulated and you point out the example of the women with the lhasa apso where you know, with object hoarding if you have a big enough house you will never fit the criteria for object hoarding, because you have enough space that it's never gonna get in the way of your--","right, right,"
2001,2001_013.txt,0,0.6811336874961853,"so that for me raises the question of you know, is this a disorder only a disorder when it starts to interfere with the person's life?","exactly--well, and that's practically if we get back to my original statement is where this becomes recognized is if it is interfering with your activities of daily living."
2001,2001_013.txt,0,0.7248355150222778,"so then that's the question, is a disorder a thought or is a disorder a behavior?","i think...well it's a disorder of thought that often intrudes upon a behavior, although there can be factors that minimize the impact of the behavior or exacerbate the behavior."
2002,2002_014.txt,0,0.4520793855190277,"let me get--i would like to talk about it with you at the end of the interview so that i can get your, your kind of off the cuff impressions first.","oh right, good point."
2002,2002_014.txt,0,0.4654499292373657,"but no, i would love to hear your thoughts about results because you know we're nearing 30 interviews, and these are interviews really with people who are the experts of all experts on this disorder, the group that we would hope would have the most consistent responses.","right, that's what's kind of worrying but, like you said, we'll talk about that at the end."
2002,2002_014.txt,0,0.4693261981010437,yeah.,"but yeah, you would hope that the 30 of us would have come to an agreement."
2002,2002_014.txt,0,0.49413973093032837,"yeah, so there is agreement on some topics, but there's still disagreement on some aspects so, i think it's worthwhile to know about that.",okay.
2002,2002_014.txt,0,0.47124361991882324,now i'd like to move more into the interview.,"yeah, that was fun."
2002,2002_014.txt,0,0.2522502541542053,"yeah, i mean it's always interesting particularly to see, at least we've just been interviewing clinicians, but the list that is most different i think is the underlying causes, and it really depends on people's backgrounds, the things that might contribute to hoarding disorder, which is probably not a surprise to you.",yeah.
2002,2002_014.txt,0,0.44196751713752747,"and that's just a general trend, people have always seemed to have a mix, but the order that they put them in i think will be very interesting to breakdown based on different kinds of clinicians and researchers, how they think about it.","yeah, cuz unfortunately all these things are so messy, there's gonna be an interaction of all those things, and i didn't mention genetics but i do think that creates a backdrop when these things happen."
2002,2002_015.txt,0,0.4435335695743561,"so like when somebody is exhibiting this behavior, is it because they have a problem with their thought process where they truly believe that, you know, they're going to screw up the environment or they're gonna need it later, or is it that they're saving it and then when you ask them, ""why do you saved this?"" they come up with a with a reason that seems to make sense to them why they would save it, but it's really behavioral driven?","right, that's a really good question and i think that we need more research to iron out, but the other thing i think about that sometimes is that it can be some central problem that's driving lot's of different things in their lives."
2002,2002_016.txt,0,0.36137354373931885,"another interesting thing that has happened with this list, i gave you the list of ""how would you know that somebody has hoarding disorder?"" and some clinicians take it the way you did where it was like, ""how would i diagnose a person and know if they came in my office?"" but some clinicians have started to generate these lists, and i think that they're just interpreting the question differently, i don't think that this is a difference in understanding, but it's very interesting to me nonetheless, they give a list of what a person with hoarding disorder would look like, like what are some other characteristics of that person apart from their hoarding.","like sitting in the waiting room without talking to them, yeah that did kind of cross my mind a little, but you're right i didn't go that direction."

2003,2003_043.txt,0,0.5425132513046265,or is that a process that you take patients through?,"uhm, in the INAUDIBLE that i work in, most patients come in with some awareness that they have a problem, and they come in with a readiness to work on it, but that’s the nature of the situations that i work in."
2003,2003_044.txt,0,0.511170506477356,"ok. ok. are there any situations then, where you’ve had to help patients try to gain insight or go through that with them?","i mean, we’ve definitely tried to improve on their insight, for sure."
2003,2003_044.txt,0,0.2847948372364044,and how would you help a patient try to gain insight or move further in that path towards recognition of the problem and the relationship with the disorder?,here we do a lot of education.
2003,2003_044.txt,0,0.43756282329559326,"ok. and so, when your patients will come in with a greater degree of insight, the ones that do, how do you think that they came to that insight or that understanding on their own, of their problem?","i think it’s usually when, again, outside sources have been pushing them; family has kind of done an intervention or have been on their case, or a landlord has intervened and said something, or there’s been a threat-"
2003,2003_044.txt,0,0.5646228194236755,some kind of external source,"usually some external source makes them sit up and think “ok, this has gone on long enough, i have to do something about it”"
2003,2003_045.txt,0,0.6268082857131958,do you see any of those more or less commonly?,"no, i think we see them all."
2003,2003_045.txt,0,0.44708603620529175,and you see the other three about equally in the population that you work with?,"yes, yes, i think so."
2003,2003_045.txt,0,0.31907153129577637,"uhm so for the first question, how do you think your patients would respond to “what do you think has caused you to have these behaviors, and do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?”",right.
2003,2003_046.txt,0,0.3718952238559723,so its there’s of been a movement of people being more accepting that this is an actual disorder instead of just a problem of organization that they can cope with.,yeah.
2003,2003_046.txt,0,0.3041684627532959,the other one we’d like you to think through how your patents would respond is “how convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding them?” what do you think your patients would say in response to that?,"again, a range."
2003,2003_046.txt,0,0.415902316570282,is there also that element that something bad will come of discarding it or something bad will happen if they throw it away?,oh probably.
2003,2003_046.txt,0,0.45520666241645813,"which do you think maybe came first, the urge to save or the reason for saving?",gosh i never really thought of it like that.
2003,2003_047.txt,0,0.5220797061920166,"and i don’t know, i’m just trying to think through the question with you.","yeah, yeah."
2003,2003_047.txt,0,0.5400856733322144,"we’re not holding you to it, just kind of speculate, you know?",yeah.
2003,2003_047.txt,0,0.561061441898346,and do you think that in any sense there are cultural forces that maybe associate value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions that might play a role in this disorder or do you think those are separating ideas?,"i mean not more than what we’ve talked about, with the cultural-- the identity of being frugal or creative or respectful of other people- you know, when people with hoarding keep things belonging to their deceased mother or their father, that kind of thing."
2003,2003_047.txt,0,0.5305328965187073,"the question was about that and also to kind of think about whether people might want to have more things because their value is associated with people who have a lot of things, but that sounds like you’re saying it’s not related in quite that way.","no, i think it’s more about their identity."
2003,2003_048.txt,0,0.5278968214988708,"yeah, we only have a couple questions left and i think we actually went through a decent number of them in our conversation earlier so in describing the patients that will come into your office for treatment, how long would they say that the hoarding behavior has been going on before you see them?",its usually been decades.
2003,2003_048.txt,0,0.47453203797340393,mhm.,"ok.so they’ve become, kind of, newer hoarders."
2003,2003_048.txt,0,0.5022887587547302,"and you know, speaking of family, you said family and friends will often play a role in the patient coming in and identifying that something is wrong, or something is going on that needs treatment, and so just curious as to what relatives do you find are most often involved in that process with a patient?","uh, in this program its usually extended family, not direct family."
2003,2003_048.txt,0,0.7155099511146545,we really appreciate it.,"oh, you are very welcome."
2003,2003_048.txt,0,0.6555953621864319,"so, does anyone come to mind that you think we should definitely make sure we try to speak to for this project?","you might have already talked to them because they’re already on the INAUDIBLE, but i would recommend NAME and NAME at UNIVERSITY"
2003,2003_048.txt,0,0.6897291541099548,"so, thank you.","ok, well good luck!"
2003,2003_048.txt,0,0.733813464641571,"thank you, take care.",bye.
2004,2004_050.txt,0,0.6527641415596008,"i’m on the line with my colleague, name .",hi name .
2004,2004_050.txt,0,1.0000005960464478,nice to meet you.,nice to meet you.
2004,2004_050.txt,0,0.4348413944244385,"we both read a lot of your work on hoarding disorder, so we’re really excited to talk to you today.","well, it’s my pleasure."
2004,2004_050.txt,0,0.5192259550094604,"we’re still continuing to receive replies, so thank you again for that.",good.
2004,2004_050.txt,0,0.6059362888336182,do you have any questions about any of that?,"no, that sounds good."
2004,2004_050.txt,0,0.3734787404537201,we just kind of wanted to start out wondering if you could give us your background relating to hoarding disorder to kind of start off.,ok.
2004,2004_051.txt,0,0.49508166313171387,ok. and can you tell us what your educational background is?,i have a phd in clinical psychology.
2004,2004_051.txt,0,0.7849609851837158,and so do you see patients with hoarding disorder clinically as well as conducting research?,"i only see patients clinically in connection with a research study or as, in a supervisory capacity at a supervised therapist, at a local mental health center that has an ocd center where we treat hoarding."
2004,2004_051.txt,0,0.26925599575042725,"so, with that little disclaimer, we would just like to kind of start off pretty broadly by asking you what the most important differences are between normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder in your mind?",ok.
2004,2004_052.txt,0,0.524573802947998,what are the demographics like?,"demographics for serious hoarding behavior, uh, someone who is in their fifties, mid- to late- fifties."
2004,2004_052.txt,0,0.5518732070922852,something like that.,"yeah, not much difference for rural/urban."
2004,2004_052.txt,0,0.7281575798988342,race and ethnicity?,i don’t think… there’s not much evidence out there about race and ethnicity.
2004,2004_053.txt,0,0.3371329605579376,and kind of talk through that case or cases and how you made the distinction between something that was sub-clinical or something that was not true hoarding disorder and hoarding disorder patient.,"well there’s two, two ways to think about that."
2004,2004_053.txt,0,0.5720388889312744,and how do you make the distinction for those individuals?,the distinction…yeah… the way i make the distinction is the level distress associated with the management of possessions.
2004,2004_054.txt,0,0.537672758102417,so are there elements that you regard as difficult to apply or that you see different clinicians may apply differently?,"yeah…i think, i think that one is certainly one that’s a little difficult to apply because you got to make a judgement about interference and distress and if there’s no clutter or little clutter in the living areas of the home."
2004,2004_054.txt,0,0.7199049592018127,so…,yeah.
2004,2004_055.txt,0,0.28666412830352783,the first one we have is “persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value” and we’re curious about you make the determination of value for individuals and their possessions and what makes the value judgement someone with hoarding disorders makes inappropriate?,"ok, yeah."
2004,2004_055.txt,0,0.7873994708061218,go ahead.,sure.
2004,2004_055.txt,0,0.4478069245815277,"and how you, how this criteria is meant just in terms of which of those ideas of value is meant by this criteria or all of them?",all of them.
2004,2004_055.txt,0,0.5579940676689148,or with…,with all objects.
2004,2004_055.txt,0,0.6747807860374451,"you know, you can’t value everything as valuable.",i’m not quite sure i follow what you said but i… what my experience is that they value all objects and have great difficulty distinguishing the importance of possessions.
2004,2004_056.txt,0,0.35440826416015625,"so we’re curious about how you make the determination of how much stuff is too much, especially with things like home size and other people in the home may affect the degree of clutter in the space.","yeah, yeah."
2004,2004_056.txt,0,0.5375926494598389,what is the appropriate use?,"yeah, absolutely, absolutely."
2004,2004_056.txt,0,0.36789068579673767,do you feel like hoarding disorder could just be an extension of this variance that surpasses socially acceptable thresholds?,absolutely.
2004,2004_057.txt,0,0.4562162756919861,"so it’s interesting, and i’m wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you see that in your patients or how, if you have examples of the way that people experience this differently.",yeah.
2004,2004_057.txt,0,0.2807803452014923,well how do you determine how much distress is normal or abnormal and how does that relate to potential insight issues when a patient denies having a problem and making that determination of distress?,yeah.
2004,2004_057.txt,0,0.3954541087150574,just making the determination in how much distress is normal or abnormal.,"oh yeah, okay."
2004,2004_058.txt,0,0.722143292427063,"and so to kind of follow up on what you just said in terms of patients who may or may not realize the extent to which they are experiencing distress, i just wanted to start the conversation about insight by asking first how you would define insight in this context.","my view of insight, i think, is that if we want to say whether or not someone has insight, we should use the more classical definition of insight, anosognosia – the understanding that i have a disorder where something’s wrong."
2004,2004_058.txt,0,0.5772210955619812,that’s a really important distinction.,yeah.
2004,2004_058.txt,0,0.32879072427749634,and that clinicians think that because the patient values a piece of paper they don’t have insight…,right.
2004,2004_058.txt,0,0.3623689115047455,but the patient actually is aware of the fact that that behavior represents itself as that novel behavior.,it represents something that…
2004,2004_058.txt,0,0.5657598972320557,…they do have insight.,yeah.
2004,2004_060.txt,0,0.2814090847969055,"and does the idea of indifference kind of… something that we heard from previous interviews is that when patients are indifferent, it can be difficult to distinguish hoarding disorder from disorders like depression where they’re simply indifferent to their surroundings or they don’t throw things away because they don’t care, and i wonder if you can talk through whether, kind of, insight.",um i’m not quite sure i fully understood that.
2004,2004_061.txt,0,0.5779078602790833,"and kind of maybe to go along with that idea: when you meet a patient who is alleged to have very low insight, how do you help that patient try to gain insight or what do you say to them to help them to understand what’s going on with their behavior as being problematic?",well largely i approach it using a motivational interviewing approach; and the idea there is to begin where the patient is.
2004,2004_062.txt,0,0.6278051137924194,how do patients come to this realization themselves sometimes or not?,you mean the realization that i have a problem?
2004,2004_062.txt,0,0.3763275742530823,the realization that they have a disorder that might need treatment.,yeah.
2004,2004_062.txt,0,0.29550689458847046,and that kind of arises just from interacting with people and recognizing the damage it does to your things that you value on your own?,right.
2004,2004_062.txt,0,0.42762628197669983,"well i think i’d first like to hear about your availability name  for, if we would have some more questions for you today, would you be able to…",yeah.
2004,2004_063.txt,0,0.6221538186073303,it that an okay way to proceed?,yeah.
2004,2004_063.txt,0,0.54963618516922,"um, excellent.",so you’ll be in touch…
2004,2004_063.txt,0,0.5607430338859558,"we really, really…",we’ll set up another time?
2004,2004_063.txt,0,0.7013711333274841,yeah we will.,ok.
2004,2004_063.txt,0,0.48388493061065674,we really appreciate your time and all of your work has been really great to read and this has been an extremely interesting conversation and i think that we both will look forward to continuing it when you have more time.,alright.
2004,2004_063.txt,0,0.5303735136985779,"yeah, thank you very much.",(part 2)
2004,2004_064.txt,0,0.7950206398963928,"good morning, NAME?","yes, NAME?"
2004,2004_064.txt,0,0.6545247435569763,hi.,"alright, good."
2004,2004_064.txt,0,0.6574898362159729,we really appreciate it.,sure.
2004,2004_064.txt,0,0.3334016799926758,"and um, just to kind of reiterate, the goal is to eventually do patient interviews and hopefully have them take a look at these questions as well, and kind of be able to compare the answers that we’re getting from clinicians and what patients are actually telling us.",ok.
2004,2004_064.txt,0,0.34361177682876587,"do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?” so, how do you think your patients would reply or respond to that?",uh.
2004,2004_064.txt,0,0.6528559923171997,do you think that there are things that would make a patient more likely to believe in the biological origin versus not?,"i think if they had recognized that in themselves and been trying to work on in and been unable to make progress, then i think they’re more likely to say it’s a biological cause, that “there’s something wrong with my brain.”"
2004,2004_064.txt,0,0.3224368989467621,"so, it seems like they need to have some insight in order to be doing the things to try and improve, that that’s kind of tied into their understanding of it as being biological.","i think so, yeah."
2004,2004_064.txt,0,0.4118342399597168,yeah.,"but, what happens when you are… when you have tried and failed at something?"
2004,2004_065.txt,0,0.5539401769638062,"and, do you… have you found or do you have any speculation as to which group would be easier to treat, of those two groups?","well, i think the treatment starts in a different place."
2004,2004_065.txt,0,0.2761000692844391,and in… so it’s almost along a spectrum where considering it as a character trait may be kind of a little further behind the individual who’s thinking of it as a biological disorder.,"right, right."
2004,2004_065.txt,0,0.39698526263237,can there be INAUDIBLE that they just need to INAUDIBLE.,"no, no, i think… yeah, i think it can be looked at easily, the problem-solving exercise, that “here’s the problem i’ve got, i’ve got to solve it.”"
2004,2004_065.txt,0,0.4338090419769287,yeah.,"because, you know, everything is reductionistic."
2004,2004_066.txt,0,0.3198758661746979,"the explanation that individuals with hoarding disorder have, those reasons that justify their behaviors, do you feel that those explanations are just post hoc reasons to justify a pathological need?","yeah possibly, possibly."
2004,2004_066.txt,0,0.49840879440307617,"so, you would say that you feel that for a good portion of individuals there may be some kind of need that’s being explained by psychological things or personality or whatever?","i think so, i mean i think… i think that it’s hard for people who are engaging in a behavior that they feel some degree of shame about not to make attributions about one’s character, and it’s especially hard for family members of people with hoarding disorder not to make attributions about their character."
2004,2004_066.txt,0,0.2760784327983856,"ok, another, kind of tie in to that is do you think that… or how much do you think that cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions, how much do you think that that plays a role in the development of hoarding disorder?",that’s a good question.
2004,2004_066.txt,0,0.3715897500514984,"and what do you think the relationship is between hoarding disorder and compulsive or addictive shopping, or a disorder where it focuses more on acquisition or acquisitions of specific items?","oh, i think they’re closely related."
2004,2004_067.txt,0,0.6273142099380493,"mhm. another question on the babs that we kind of wanted you to think through how your patients might respond is, “how convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that something bad will come of discarding them?”","i think that’s… if it’s worded correctly, i think patients will say that they are convinced."
2004,2004_067.txt,0,0.29802289605140686,"well, something that we’re kind of trying to do… these questions have been kind of challenging, more challenging for us to develop because the brown assessment of beliefs is much more geared towards obsessive compulsive disorder and INAUDIBLE.","right, right."
2004,2004_067.txt,0,0.45443713665008545,how do get an insight through these kinds of measures?,"yeah, yeah."
2004,2004_067.txt,0,0.395412415266037,"so how have you, kind of, come to deal with this problem?","well, if you want to talk about insight, i think for hoarding you want to go back to its original definition."
2004,2004_067.txt,0,0.36886733770370483,INAUDIBLE,"yeah, yeah, we haven’t, but NAME and NAME and i spent a couple years trying to develop these, and we came up with a whole series of questions and just were never satisfied that they captured what we intended with insight."
2004,2004_068.txt,0,0.566882848739624,it’s interesting to hear you talk about it.,"yeah, it’s really, i think it’s a really hard problem to solve."
2004,2004_068.txt,0,0.6555773019790649,or is that not the case?,i don’t know.
2004,2004_068.txt,0,0.44492897391319275,where would you locate the problem if it’s not INAUDIBLE?,i think it’s more what is available to help people.
2004,2004_068.txt,0,0.518959105014801,"we were just wondering if you could talk us through, from your experience, the typical process that occurs in order to get patients into your office for treatment or for study participation.","well, i think for the most part, what happens is that people go through long periods of time where they are criticized by family members, pressured by family members, and then maybe the authorities get involved and so they… one of the ways that people get in around here is when we run, we have a community forum on collecting and clutter and we make announcements about a very intensive workshop."
2004,2004_069.txt,0,0.5512706637382507,"and how long would you say that this behavior has been going on, typically, before they get to that point?",usually decades.
2004,2004_069.txt,0,0.6874406337738037,did it start when they were a child or young adult or develop later in life?,"well, the research we’ve done on it suggests it starts fairly early, about somewhere in between 10 and 20 years old, and although it’s not serious then, the behaviors begin then."
2004,2004_069.txt,0,0.3668554127216339,is it your sense that it’s a progressive disorder in the sense that the behaviors worsen or is it a progressive disorder in the sense that they accumulate more and more stuff and so it appears to be worse over time because they have more later?,"yeah, that’s a good question."
2004,2004_069.txt,0,0.6389683485031128,"and in terms of family and friends kind of playing a role in arriving at, you know, the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, do you have a sense of which family and friends are most often involved and how that goes?","usually it’s adult children of the individual, and sometimes it’s a sibling, sometimes it’s a spouse, but the majority of the cases i’ve seen where the family gets involved it’s the adult children of an elderly person who’s been doing it for many years and now may have had some kind of health setback and is going to have more trouble living in an environment that is heavily cluttered."
2004,2004_069.txt,0,0.6061113476753235,"landlords, police officers, you know, homeowner’s associations, those kinds of people.","oh yeah, homeowner’s associations certainly are, health departments, elder service agencies, child and family services, animal control, they all have stories, and they all have cases."
2004,2004_070.txt,0,0.5499916076660156,"and, INAUDIBLE.",in part.
2004,2004_070.txt,0,0.7186119556427002,do you feel like that’s something that’s unique to hoarding disorder or more salient here than in other psychiatric disorders?,"well i think it might be more salient for people who are close to the individual because other disorders – anxiety, depression, and so forth – a lot of the behaviors can be hidden, a lot of the experiences can be hidden, but in hoarding disorder, for anyone who is in that person’s living environment, it can’t be hidden, and so i think that’s one of the reasons why."
2004,2004_071.txt,0,0.3417057394981384,"yeah, so this is the last thing that we kind of like to close with in all our interviews what do you think are the biggest things that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder?",wow.

2005,2005_080.txt,0,0.7763050198554993,yeah so now we're just talking about yeah dsm five yeah mhm.,yeah so were just going to ask some questions about the dsm five criteria.
2005,2005_080.txt,0,0.4146105945110321,yeah um,are there things about those criteria that you sometimes find challenging or particular elements of the criteria that you think are particularly difficult to apply or that you think different clinicians might apply slightly differently?
2005,2005_080.txt,0,0.5595982074737549,hm i believe so yeah um-,anything that comes to mind?
2005,2005_080.txt,0,0.3610404133796692,"hm i think that um, i think uh the the the difficulties or emotional difficulties of letting go of stuff um this one can be tricky sometimes, especially uh when you interact with people who are um less aware of their their difficulties, they may say ‘oh i don’t have difficulties i can get rid of them i just don’t have time’ yeah so this one can be-","okay, so that might be mhm do you feel like clinical judgment plays role in diagnosis of hoarding disorder and how would you compare that in your experience to the role of clinical judgment in other psychiatric disorders?"
2005,2005_080.txt,0,0.3398638963699341,"i’m not quite sure, i don’t understand the question.","yeah so this is just kind of wondering to what extent you think an individual clinician kind of clinical judgment about what constitutes hoarding disorder plays a role in in diagnoses, and what do you think that that’s that’s special with hoarding disorder, or whether it pertains to um all psychiatric disorders equally?"
2005,2005_080.txt,0,0.4143804609775543,but i think overall across all clinicians i don’t think that hoarding disorder may be more or less bias then other diagnoses.,mhm.
2005,2005_080.txt,0,0.37229397892951965,"uh, well not now, that i say it i think that um i guess because because hoarding is still very new so, not a lot of people, not a lot of clinicians are sensitive as sensitive about hoarding then are other diagnose such as hm major depression, so they may not have the clinical sensitivity to think of ‘oh i wonder if i should go through this with this person?’.",mhm mhm.
2005,2005_080.txt,0,0.39775413274765015,"yeah, so it can be under diagnosed yeah.","mhm, okay um want to take the next one name ?"
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.3287968039512634,yeah.,"okay um, i just want to ask you about another one of um one of the criteria, so this criteria reads ‘the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromise their intended use’ so the question i’d like to ask is how do you judge um clutter and how much stuff counts as clutter?"
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.6934568881988525,"so i have seen people who have um who don’t have a lot of a lot of clutter, but they still have other emotional attachment that is very typical for people with hoarding problems and um so it seems that clutter seems to me that is more like the severity of the disease so kind of like when someone has died inaudible  they already inaudible  different but an and if someone has diabetes but they are still in the early stage of the disease then they don’t have as much um symptoms and that’s how i see it, i actually see it this um this criteria as a a like additional like help to diagnose but the core i think would be the first two criteria, which is the difficulty and why its difficult for them to let go of things.",so somebody can have hoarding disorder and not actually have as much clutter because-
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.43127262592315674,yeah.,what really for you defines the disorder is the difficulty discarding?
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.49536168575286865,"yeah yeah, although i know that the criteria says this is a very important one and it’s a necessary one.",mhm.
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.49855878949165344,"but yeah i think people who who are more more financially resourceful so they actually have another house that is meant for their clutter to go to and more storage units, yeah.","so um we were just about to ask about that yeah, so it sounds like how much space you have also kind of can play a role."
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.37316128611564636,"yeah, yeah, and that’s why in uh in i think in this particular inaudible  relationship criteria also say it's not because of other people it is intervening the place.",mhm.
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.40801316499710083,"yeah and i, its common they live with family members but it's more under control.",mhm mhm okay.
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.35529354214668274,"hm uh, i don’t think that is inaudible  yeah i think they’re i actually think that it's not a continuum this it uh um i think it’s a different thing, it's not only because they want something to be out there so it's easier to use, it more fear based its like if i don’t do this i may have negative consequences, so in this way i think these are different.",okay
2005,2005_081.txt,0,0.3370952010154724,okay,"and and kind of a follow up on that, uh in terms of the intended use of the space so that you have some functions inaudible  substantially compromises the intended use, um do you ever think about um whether there might be other appropriate uses for example, somebody who wants to use the space for storage where that space might not be intended for storage, but i guess i’m wondering what is an appropriate intended use for a space?"
2005,2005_082.txt,0,0.37806516885757446,"hm uh um i i think the way i determine this so for example kitchen is intended to be used for cooking, and bedroom is for sleeping and um dining table is intended to to you can sit there and eat, yeah.",mhm.
2005,2005_082.txt,0,0.5720402002334595,yeah so that’s how i determine it.,"the intended use, okay."
2005,2005_082.txt,0,0.2852170467376709,yeah.,"um, the next criteria, the last criteria actually i’d like you to think through with us is the one that starts ‘this difficulty is due to a preceded need to save items and the distress associated with discarding them’ eh and um what we were wondering about this one was how you assess someone’s distress to determine what’s normal or abnormal with regard to discarding, what for you is distinguishing from abnormal stress?"
2005,2005_082.txt,0,0.3028607964515686,"yeah, so um uh so so if someone says if that i want i want to get rid of this but i can’t bring myself to do this and because i would feel sad or it would be terrible if i can’t find it anymore, then like if i get rid of it later i can’t i when i want to use it i can’t have it it's like uh so when they have a lot of um uh when uh, because these would be like normal uh consequences for for normal people like we often will get rid of things and then later we realize ‘oh we shouldn’t have get gotten rid of that i can i could have used it now’ but its not um for people without hoarding disorder it wasn’t it wouldn’t feel like like almost like the end of the world or very um very extreme but for people with hoarding disorder they tend to um um consider these as very intolerable situations and emotions are quiet strong, yeah.",mhm.
2005,2005_082.txt,0,0.4228675663471222,LAUGHING,"yeah no no i think you, are i guess i’m wondering-"
2005,2005_082.txt,0,0.2910059690475464,okay.,"if you think patients do have lower levels of insight into their disorder um it might sometimes have difficulty with this criteria, or they might not be aware of how distressed they are?"
2005,2005_082.txt,0,0.40996113419532776,"yeah yeah yeah they um they can they can say that ‘oh i already i know that i’m going to get rid of it and then sometimes i thought i should often’ so how long how long have have this uh this the inaudible  thing been sitting there and often times they would say ‘oh actually it's over a year now’, and so that that will give me an idea of maybe this is not its not as easy as they think it is for them to get rid of it.","so they might not realize, they might not even realize that they have distress, so it's not even that they might be denying it to you they they really don’t know that they’re stressed."
2005,2005_082.txt,0,0.8156417012214661,mhm yeah.,okay.
2005,2005_083.txt,0,0.32659241557121277,okay,"okay, um if you were to, it sounds like you don’t it sounds like what you’re saying is that um in your practice a lot of times when patients see you they already have a degree of insight because they’re seeking treatment um-"
2005,2005_084.txt,0,0.3509732782840729,mhm,"if you were to or if you have tried to explain hoarding disorder to a patient with low insight how would you explain it, how would you try to help a patient with hoarding disorder understand what hoarding disorder is and that they have it?"

2005,2005_084.txt,0,0.599718451499939,"so in this situation i would i would try to help them to become aware of how this um situation is and getting in the way of them living a better life condition they can have could have so i can ask them ‘oh um is there any inconvenience?’ ‘oh no’ they may be defensive and say ‘oh i’m very used to it i’m very comfortable with it there’s no problem about this’ and then um then so kind of like motivational interview and try to help them to see the discrepancy of what they could have to like to live um and in the current condition and, uh so um- sorry i’m blanking out on the original question.","oh no no no, that was a great answer it sounds like if you’re saying you’re trying to help patients to understand their disorder you really focus on they way that the disorder is getting in the way of their life and try to highlight it and how their lives could be better/"

2005,2005_085.txt,0,0.47967928647994995,so yeah that would be one hundred percent sure i would never get rid of it.,mhm mhm.
2005,2005_085.txt,0,0.6130212545394897,hm.,i don’t know if that question was quite clear.
2005,2005_085.txt,0,0.363236665725708,um.,"so do you think that theses reasons are the real reasons, or do you think these reasons are just the result of an underlying need that they have just kind of come up with to justify their um hoarding disorder?"
2005,2005_085.txt,0,0.23726767301559448,"hm yeah, yeah this is a very good question, hm, i would i would say at least half of the case this is very more conservative estimation, i would say this would be the more um uh more superficial reasons and it may and i don’t know if it's something they come up to justify the behavior, or this is a kind of like a defense mechanism for something more vulnerable deep down, yeah i um i’m thinking as i’m saying this i am remembering sometimes like several cases in the groups that i led, people would realize actually a lot of times they are they are having under the real underlying issue for example, for one person who had shared, he doesn’t know he wouldn’t know what to do with his life if he no longer has hoarding problems, its almost like now he has something to focus on and if if i don’t have to focus on this, and my problem is solved he will be facing something that’s terribly scary and i don’t know what to do with my life and so i i as i’m answering the question i’m thinking, about this example and i think there are other examples too like, its more about the emotions underlying underlying that’s probably more scary to face so they are probably more like uh um the more uh thoughts and justifications for for all this behaviors and they are thinking of ‘this is why i should keep this’ so its to not directly tough the emotions for example loss of a family member, or yeah loss of an identity of the past that they used to have when they were still working, for example, yeah.",name  uh want to go ahead?

2005,2005_086.txt,0,0.24913230538368225,"hm i personally think so, yeah i do think so, yeah the ‘cause ‘cause the society seems to give a lot of reinforcement um on the capacity of buying and what profess- what items can mean to someone status someone identity and someone’s tastes, you have good things then you are a tasteful and elegant person, and yeah a lot of it seems that uh this is such a consumer based society, and a lot of things are telling you to buy and all the holidays are all about buying, so yeah i think that society plays a big role in this, not that is causes hoarding disorder but it definitely encourage it.","um, so we have i think like maybe one or two more questions, um i we’re going to try to keep it confined to the next five minutes but i want to be respectful of your time so if you need to cut us off as we wrap this up, please just let us know, okay?"

2005,2005_088.txt,0,0.7136207818984985,of course we’ve all heard the inaudible,inaudible
2005,2005_088.txt,0,0.5680045485496521,sorry,no no that’s a great answer.
2005,2005_088.txt,0,0.4279140532016754,"yeah and i i said, they last thing was that of course there’s heritability but we don’t know which genes yet, but that’s obviously more up there and worth digging into.",mhm.
2005,2005_088.txt,0,0.4255101680755615,"yeah, so many LAUGHING.","um well, thank you so much for you time and for your really wonderful and thoughtful answers that was a great interview, and we really really appreciate you talking with us about this."
2005,2005_089.txt,0,0.44852691888809204,"i wonder if you would like to talk to people who are not psychologist, because they are like the mfts who are working with this population and i because i don’t know uh what kind of clinicians or what kind of researchers are you are targeting so i don’t know if you want more variety or less variety?","yeah, no were trying to kind of get a pretty board i think um picture of what the clinical consensus looks like, so across the-"
2005,2005_089.txt,0,0.6602063179016113,hm uh i see so maybe i can write you an email and just list a few names that i know locally that maybe you can pick whether they would be a good fit.,that perfect thank you so much i’ll follow up with you via email to get those names.
2005,2005_089.txt,0,0.7833367586135864,"thank you, oh thank you, good luck.",thank you
2005,2005_089.txt,0,0.8537614345550537,"okay bye, nice talking to you.","nice talking to you, take care."
2006,2006_090.txt,0,0.3829694092273712,"and just to kind of get us started with the conversation, we would like to here just a little about your background related to hoarding disorder, what your work is like now, i know that we have both read a bunch of it, so we kind of know the answer to this one but just to kind of get us situated here.",ok
2006,2006_090.txt,0,0.4172975420951843,if you could give us a brief overview of your history with patients who have hoarding disorder.,sure.
2006,2006_090.txt,0,0.46559157967567444,"um, it’s just, maybe there was a follow up question that would be right now in your research what is the particular inaudible  for you.",oh yeah.
2006,2006_090.txt,0,0.42720481753349304,it sounds like there’s still definitely will be an audience for that.,"but that’s probably more about communicating with the people who need to know than, it is a project, it’s not a study of hoarding per say."
2006,2006_091.txt,0,0.3258640170097351,particularly focusing on the difference between maybe what would be considered normal saving behavior or collecting and what constitutes hoarding disorder.,ok.
2006,2006_091.txt,0,0.2836484909057617,hmm,"um, and so you think about birds that nest, squirrels that, uh, they’re scatter hoarders and larder hoarders."
2006,2006_092.txt,0,0.31921255588531494,right,"even if we say things for, you know, because we are attached to it."
2006,2006_092.txt,0,0.6138370037078857,do you think that…,i don’t.
2006,2006_093.txt,0,0.4435899555683136,and how did you end up making your decision in that case.,the cases that i have seen have already been bedded within our research project.
2006,2006_093.txt,0,0.638544499874115,have you ever been part of that diagnosing process?,"um, yes and no. i have not, at this stage, late stage of my career, had to sit down and diagnose people using the structured interview for hoarding disorder inaudible  that name  have used, that’s the standard interview that is available at this point."
2006,2006_094.txt,0,0.32806748151779175,does anything come to mind?,"um, the only thing that occurs to me is the need, once you verify that there’s clutter in the home and that it interferes with function, it’s really the differential diagnosis that seems to me to be important because hoarding disorder requires that there be a, um, a hard requirement to have difficulty letting go of objects and that can sometimes be a little bit hard to distinguish, whether the rationale that you’re hearing people describe matches our understanding of, again, a wide variety of reasons why people have trouble letting go."
2006,2006_094.txt,0,0.39232978224754333,"mmhmm, mmhmm","and so you can hear multiple different reasons for that, that you want to make sure the difficulty parting with objects gets a pattern."
2006,2006_094.txt,0,0.5850181579589844,"so, um, in a clinician’s area, what do we mean by value?","i would say it doesn’t really matter what you mean by value because it’s regardless of their actual value, so you don’t really care what the actual value is."
2006,2006_094.txt,0,0.6953471302986145,you know what i mean?,oh yeah.
2006,2006_095.txt,0,0.4241308271884918,so the first thing that maybe you can talk through for us is the idea of clutter and how you determine what counts as clutter.,ok.
2006,2006_095.txt,0,0.6450961828231812,"so the disorganization seems to play a role, but it is not necessary.",it’s not absolutely necessary.
2006,2006_095.txt,0,0.662962794303894,like if someone has a huge basement versus if they live in a one trailer home.,"i’m sure there’s some truth to that, but someone with a significant hoarding problem would have to have more than a basement or attic that was full of stuff."
2006,2006_095.txt,0,0.31814590096473694,mmhmm,"they would, they would need, it has to be in living spaces and it has to impede their use or you don’t have a hoarding problem, you just have somebody who owns a lot of stuff."
2006,2006_096.txt,0,0.27275100350379944,"ok. and that kind of brings us to the part of the question that talks about intended use, um, the compromises of intended use.","by the way, i think one of the things you also or want to be aware of, and i’m sure you know this, is that if someone else lives in the home and they protect the living spaces, and the, it’s only, it’s the spaces that the other person who has control over that is a disaster, that can be one hoarder in the home and on non-hoarder who has control."
2006,2006_096.txt,0,0.5934954881668091,mmhmm.,"ok, i’m sorry, go back to your question."
2006,2006_096.txt,0,0.39522117376327515,inaudible,"there, you know, there’s tremendous variability in everyday housekeeping by most people."
2006,2006_097.txt,0,0.5833443999290466,"and i guess we’d like you to talk through the determinations of distress and what level of distress is normal and abnormal and whether there are sometimes problems in assessing the levels of distress that hoarders have about discarding, particularly in cases where the patient might have very low insight about their own problem.","um, the distress associated with discarding it is usually pretty evident, there, they report it freely."
2006,2006_097.txt,0,0.3742189109325409,"now for you, do you feel like these explanations that people give you for why they save are real reasons or are they kind of justifications for an underlying need?",what a good question.
2006,2006_098.txt,0,0.5024168491363525,"in talking to patients, do you think that patients see their behavior as having a biological cause, a psychological cause, a personal history cause, in cases where they do actually recognize that they have a disorder?","um, i think again we’ve got some variability there, and they’re doing their best like we all are to explain why they do what they do, which is getting them into trouble."
2006,2006_099.txt,0,0.35208988189697266,"do you feel like there are consistent subgroups within patients of hoarding disorder that might be useful or do you think that it’s true kind of, you know, not random, but true variability in the sense that it would be difficult to kind of group people?","well, i think we are interested in trying to do that."
2006,2006_099.txt,0,0.4733610153198242,"we have some more questions for you, but feel free to cut of the interview if at any point you’re…",that’s ok.
2006,2006_100.txt,0,0.3926229178905487,"so if i were to ask you how you would define the concept of insight, how would you define it?","the extent to which the client recognizes or is aware of the fact that they have a problem with too much clutter and difficulty parting with objects and that they consider that to be not in their best interest, and therefore something that they would like to correct."
2006,2006_100.txt,0,0.31090638041496277,"i’m going to try to articulate what you just said and you can correct me is that it’s not so much insight is that the patients recognize that their need to keep things is irrational, so much is that they recognize that their behavior is a problem and they want to change the problem in hoarding disorder.",yes.
2006,2006_101.txt,0,0.23638281226158142,"we’ve talked about a lot of ways of potentially subdividing people within, you know, that there’s a variety, that you find that some of the subgroups have an easier time recognizing their behavior as presenting a problem or harder time.",yes.
2006,2006_101.txt,0,0.34003525972366333,"in your experience, are any of these more prevalent or problematic in your work with individuals with hoarding disorder?","ok, let’s go down that list name ."
2006,2006_101.txt,0,0.7996759414672852,defensiveness.,"defensiveness… i think you’re going to find that, ok clearly, commonly, but let’s come back to that."
2006,2006_101.txt,0,0.3662273585796356,anosognosia.,"um, yeah, i’m going to say that that’s a little rarer."
2006,2006_101.txt,0,0.64899742603302,overvalued ideation.,"um, that would be overvaluing the objects themselves."
2006,2006_101.txt,0,0.4037678837776184,"yeah, i think my understanding from the literature is that it relates to kind of that attachment to that object that you described.",right.
2006,2006_101.txt,0,0.7229392528533936,the last one was indifference.,and what did you mean by indifference?
2006,2006_101.txt,0,0.37305307388305664,"indifference to the state of the home, the living situation that they’re in.",i see.
2006,2006_102.txt,0,0.26048389077186584,"so it sounds like what you’re saying is that kind of the major, real causes of insight of hoarding disorder might be that lack of ability to perceive the illness and perhaps overvalued ideation being the main one than the others, indifference and defensiveness being either other comorbidities or reactions.",yeah.
2006,2006_102.txt,0,0.5667222142219543,so what kinds of thing s would you say to your patient to help them gain insight?,"i would go straight to motivational interviewing techniques in which you do a variety of strategies, but what you always do is take a backseat."
2006,2006_103.txt,0,0.5316876173019409,"when you do see family, friends, or a social network playing a role in helping patients to come to see you or to come to see a clinician, which relatives or members of the social network are normally involved in those cases?",i would say the most common at this stage of the game are adult children and second are spouses.
2006,2006_103.txt,0,0.2915221154689789,"and do you often see involvement of like state employees, such as social workers or police officers or landlords for being a motivator for bringing people in.",only if there’s a threat.
2006,2006_103.txt,0,0.41746681928634644,is that relatively rare?,"um, no, well again, it depends on the source of the clientele."
2006,2006_103.txt,0,0.4499683678150177,what are the biggest questions that we still don’t have answered?,"um, those are the ones that i mentioned at the very beginning."
2006,2006_103.txt,0,0.4280104339122772,"so those seem to be the biggest questions that’s kind of, uh…","there’s, there’s one other question and that is that while this problem is age old, so we know it is not due nearly to our current cultural context and we know it crosses cultures."
2006,2006_104.txt,0,0.4634730815887451,we’ve gained a lot from that.,well…good…go ahead.
2006,2006_104.txt,0,0.7068322896957397,that was it.,ok.
2006,2006_104.txt,0,0.5316953659057617,"could you think of anybody, or would you prefer that we email and ask you this question so you can think about it?",well you probably already have a list of folks that you have either contacted or are going to be contacting.
2006,2006_104.txt,0,0.2392730563879013,"um, i mean, i’m not actually sure if we are or not, but i think that the purpose of asking that question is to make sure that we are being comprehensive and that we…",so the one’s… i’ll just throw out the names of the people that i work most closely with across the country.
2006,2006_104.txt,0,0.541520893573761,would it be helpful if we sent you an email?,sure.
2006,2006_105.txt,0,0.5810425281524658,"you have actually added to our list now just off the top of your head, so i really appreciate your effort in doing that.","oh, there’s a couple more who occurred to me."
2006,2006_105.txt,0,0.6574108600616455,thank you so much for your time today.,sure.
2007,2007_106.txt,0,0.35093578696250916,"and so, she’s trying to get to a place where she can, uh, minimize some of that background noise… [inaudible 00:].",sure thing.
2007,2007_106.txt,0,0.4696374833583832,"uhm in the meantime, if you’d like to get started, the first thing i’d like to do is go through a…an informed consent that we have with you.",ok.
2007,2007_106.txt,0,0.6532853245735168,would that be alright?,sure
2007,2007_106.txt,0,0.5135933756828308,"your participation is volunteer, you will not be paid for your participation",mhm.
2007,2007_106.txt,0,0.4606926739215851,"and all your record of the interview will be…uh and subsequent dialogue, will be made.",mhm.
2007,2007_106.txt,0,0.5644948482513428,do you have any questions about any of that?,uh nope!
2007,2007_107.txt,0,0.4011247456073761,"now kind of to move into the next section of the interview, would you mind giving us a little bit about your background related to hoarding disorder?",sure.
2007,2007_107.txt,0,0.3341084122657776,"you know, what are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, like collecting or something like that, and hoarding disorder?",well that they don’t actually have their stuff on display.
2007,2007_107.txt,0,0.6023246645927429,"are there other really standout features that define hoarding disorder, clinically?","uhm standout features, i mean certainly the amount of clutter is going to be-- like some, like-- once in a while people will think that they have a bad problem and its really not that cluttered."
2007,2007_108.txt,0,0.46567898988723755,"ok. are there certain kinds of people that are more likely to be hoarders: older or younger, different races, socioeconomic backgrounds, rural versus urban?",sure-- uhm i mean so the actual-- the actual amount of clutter usually takes a while to accumulate.
2007,2007_108.txt,0,0.47243887186050415,and how you were able to make that distinction?,yeah.
2007,2007_108.txt,0,0.49944818019866943,"kind of in a similar vein, have there been times when people have described things as being very mild, to the point where it’s not an issue and then you do the visit and find that things are much worse?","usually, let’s see, i think that there have certainly been cases like that, but a lot of the times i don’t end up being able to do in-home visits anymore; that’s because of insurance issues or things like that, or if they live quite a distance."
2007,2007_108.txt,0,0.46642473340034485,ok. so next section of the interview i want to talk to you a little about the dsm-5 criteria for hoarding disorder.,mhm.
2007,2007_109.txt,0,0.4125782251358032,have you had to apply this criterion with the intent of diagnosing someone with hoarding disorder?,uhm yes.
2007,2007_109.txt,0,0.6786645650863647,"are there things about the dsm-5 criteria that are sometimes challenging, you know, elements that you regard as difficult to apply, or might apply differently to different clinicians, things to do with language perhaps?","uhm i don’t have it-- i don’t have the language right in front of me, but because i think that that was how i was trained, was with what ultimately ended up being the dsm-5 criteria, or pretty close to it, i generally just, i guess like it in comparison to the dsm-4."
2007,2007_109.txt,0,0.43634912371635437,"so, one of the phrases is “persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value.”",mhm.
2007,2007_109.txt,0,0.4429081082344055,what makes the value judgement of an individual with hoarding disorder as inappropriate?,"sure, well i mean, there are some cases that are very clear cut-- if it’s actually like garbage or, you know, food waste or things like that."
2007,2007_109.txt,0,0.576932430267334,ok.,"so yeah, i mean mostly value."
2007,2007_109.txt,0,0.3547140955924988,"and so that value, to you, kind of more means a monetary value as opposed to emotional or aesthetic value?",sure.
2007,2007_109.txt,0,0.3914334774017334,"so, at that point it’s not necessarily the inappropriate value judgement, so much as the amount that they have of that item?",yeah.
2007,2007_110.txt,0,0.5511980652809143,so how much stuff counts as cluttered space?,sure.
2007,2007_110.txt,0,0.5989099144935608,ok.,"so that, i guess, is part of it."
2007,2007_110.txt,0,0.514590859413147,does home-size play into this at all?,"uhm, sure."
2007,2007_110.txt,0,0.6697694063186646,"so, for example…",sure.
2007,2007_110.txt,0,0.3546646535396576,do you think hoarding disorder could be just an extension of this variance that surpasses a socially acceptable threshold?,well but it’s no longer productive.
2007,2007_111.txt,0,0.6635156869888306,so how do you make a determination of how much distress is normal or abnormal?,"uhm lets see-- probably based on uhm-- i mean most things that we do in any area of the dsm, we have to do based on kind of like a scale of, you know, no distress at all to extreme distress."
2007,2007_111.txt,0,0.7051564455032349,"or is the distress always apparent, as a feature regardless of insight?","uhm i think the distress is usually pretty apparent as a feature, like in terms of how bothersome it is for them to actually get rid of something."
2007,2007_111.txt,0,0.5712024569511414,"uh so kind of leading into that next section, we wanted to talk a little bit about insight in hoarding disorder so, how do you define insight?","well the awareness that someone has into some sort of problematic behavior, i guess."
2007,2007_111.txt,0,0.41634970903396606,ok.,"and usually that’s like, you know, being objective in comparison to someone else’s point of view."
2007,2007_112.txt,0,0.7777953743934631,or both?,uhm i think it could be both.
2007,2007_112.txt,0,0.43147706985473633,"do you feel in your experience that any of these factors are more prevalent or more problematic in the individuals you work with, with hoarding disorder?",uhm can you repeat them?
2007,2007_112.txt,0,0.3863868713378906,"yeah so, “defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideations, and indifference” have been some of the ones sited in the literature as kind of comprised in that insight.",sure.
2007,2007_112.txt,0,0.5016766786575317,"ok. and how do you go about explaining hoarding disorder-- how would you, to a patient with low insight?",uhm really try to hammer home the impairment that they have.
2007,2007_112.txt,0,0.2636969983577728,"and kind of hitting it from that angle, have you found, in your experience, helps patients to be able to gain insight, making that connection to the consequences?",uhm yeah.
2007,2007_113.txt,0,0.33292776346206665,"ok, are there things that might cause a patient to fail to gain insight?","uhm, if they feel like you’re- so some people really don’t like the label of hoarding."
2007,2007_113.txt,0,0.38391757011413574,"so we want you to think through a couple of the questions that we have from the brown assessment of beliefs scale, and in your experience, think about how your patients might respond to these questions.",ok.
2007,2007_113.txt,0,0.3914508521556854,do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?,"uhm, and just like, freely what their answer would be, or do you have the answers?"
2007,2007_113.txt,0,0.3642633855342865,what you think and- yeah.,"uhm i think that some people would definitely recognize that it’s a little bit of a biological trait, in that their family members have had issues, even if they-- i think they recognize that it’s not necessarily just that they had-- they were in their surroundings growing up, but that they, and like, they have learned it from them, but also that some of its inherited."
2007,2007_113.txt,0,0.3569967448711395,"ok. so if they’ve been in their environment, they’re more likely to understand that its biological, but if not they may not make that connection?",yeah.
2007,2007_113.txt,0,0.3154437243938446,"ok so if it wasn’t a biological cause, they might have more of a psychological reason and understanding of their problem.",right.
2007,2007_113.txt,0,0.43532341718673706,uh the next question that we wanted to ask you how patients might respond is how convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding them?,"uhm, i don’t feel like there’s been a lot of people who have really felt like something horrible would happen besides-- i would say the horrible thing would be that they would feel unhappy, that they would feel uncomfortable."
2007,2007_114.txt,0,0.49641838669776917,do you feel that these explanations are just post hoc reasons to justify a pathological need?,"hmm, uhm that they’ve come up with or that researchers have come up with?"
2007,2007_114.txt,0,0.6598819494247437,uh.,"for both, i guess?"

2007,2007_115.txt,0,0.5209070444107056,so how long has the hoarding behavior typically been going on before you see patients?,usually for at least a couple of decades.

2008,2008_118.txt,0,0.4682237207889557,name  think that something might have happened and the the call got dropped,yeah yeah no worries you guys just went super silent LAUGHING
2008,2008_118.txt,0,0.6858871579170227,LAUGHING um how much of that-,i kept talking though LAUGHING
2008,2008_118.txt,0,0.475523442029953,okay well that’s perfect i think that name  offered a pretty good overview of what we're doing how the project kinda got started and and what the goals are do you have any questions for us?,no that sounds um that sounds really great name  you’re not a medical anthropologist though right?
2008,2008_118.txt,0,0.5422026515007019,no so i'm actually in the neuroscience department and where my side of things kind of comes in is that i’m going to be working on a project related to uh psychophysiology of hoarding disorder and so studying a couple of different uh erp waveforms and i think eventually um i’d like to look at some of those wave forms in the context of the the findings that we have with our hoarding participants so if there are differences in um specific subgroups based on um motivations for hoarding that they have or based on degree of insight or construct of insight that more prevalent in certain subgroups and see if that responds to differences in uh different waveforms different erp waveforms,oh yeah very interesting okay cool yeah yeah so this is great um is so when i you know when i saw it on when name  sent out the the note and then also i think name  and i've been threatening to collaborate for for a couple of years now uh this seem like a great a great you know potential project but you know it also sounds like you guys are pretty far along much further along than um i i have been in in my thinking of such a project and because i i don’t have um i i don’t have uh people power to kind of push this forward so uh everybody’s busy doing other things so yeah i mean i where my thinking was um it i'm very curious about there’s what like five groups that really understand hoarding um maybe that’s even being a little generous name name name and name  and then me and there’s like the smaller world of iocdf that knows a little bit more about hoarding but you know certainly doesn’t have an appreciation for it as as kind of as deeply as we do and then beyond that if people have heard of it they watch the show
2008,2008_118.txt,0,0.39717790484428406,yeah,which is horrible LAUGHING um so i do always have this question of were are these patients ending up ?
2008,2008_119.txt,0,0.3783263564109802,yeah,yeah that that really interesting so the way i mean i think that the uh like i i'm not a qualitative researcher so um so that the techniques and methods for that are pretty fuzzy for me but i have a really under deep appreciation for them um in part because i don’t know if you’ve already spoke with name ?
2008,2008_119.txt,0,0.28558140993118286,no we have not,oh okay well name  is a social work um she works at the unit- social work phd and works at the university  um and she does a lot of qualitative work and um and and i think its uh provides such a richer nuanced kind of perspective um that then from there you can go on to use that knowledge that that rich data that you gather to develop something that is a little more quantitative but tis more kind of informed quantitative right um it's not just whatever i'm envisioning and coming up with um so so initially what i have been thinking about it's that it would be interesting to kind of even just think about a case sample of uh you know yes the experts but then you know like a first year medical resident would be really interesting person to kind of think through ‘have you heard of hoarding?’ ‘is that something you would think about asking about?’ um ‘why do you think that would matter?’ you know like all that type of stuff um you know somebody who's going into social work who have not had exposure to hoarding which is ninety percent of social workers out there just because it's not taught in the curriculum uh you know your average kind of researched based clinical psychologist um you know same thing on that end um and then from there thinking though like where are our gaps is it dissemination about information about hoarding?
2008,2008_120.txt,0,0.36239689588546753,"um just to kind of build off that before we move into the interview and i agree i think that we have a lot of interest in common it would be interesting to me to think about i had not even thought about it until just now, using our interviews to develop a survey and then kind of doing a wider survey but that’s uh that could be that could be a productive use of our data in the future once were done with the interviews to kind of say okay what do we want to ask about un in the survey and how do we want to phrase questions, that might be something to talk about also um but yeah let's circle back to it after you’ve heard our interview and got a chance to talk though kind of more and see what kind of information were gathering",okay that sounds great
2008,2008_121.txt,0,0.5656668543815613,do you have any questions about that at this time?,no
2008,2008_121.txt,0,0.4508412182331085,and then the second part of the interview is very free form and will just be a conversation i probably should have explained that to you before we got started but um yeah so we’ll do one more this and then we'll move on and get to talk in a little more detail about all of this i'm really excited to hear what you're about to say i don’t know uh just because you’ve already kind of jumped into the issues that we really want to hit on,yeah like i said i'm really not not doing your lists very well i'll be better with this next one LAUGHING
2008,2008_121.txt,0,0.4633609354496002,um before we go to the last one is there anything else you wanted to add to to ways that a person could identify someone you know you mentioned the clutter the strong attachment to objects and extreme disorganization and then um a sense of optimism or potential that may or may not be present,once again that one i wouldn’t i would not put on a diagnostic list it's just something that i think about with these patients a lot so the other thing is also like a squishy thing and it has to do with the way they talk so there’s that inaudible  that not quite as severe its not at all as severe as you would see with someone with psychosis but you know they fact that everything takes longer with these patients including having them complete a structured interview um is interesting it’s not diagnostic but it's something that is very salient to me about these patients
2008,2008_121.txt,0,0.3350277543067932,mhm yeah,yeah you know we intentionally made this list to not be one of the diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder because it's not a quiz you know so i guess what were what we are trying to get at with this question is exactly that like what do you how would you really know if you knew about hoarding disorder what would it look like so um it might be appropriate to include it on the list even though it's technically not a diagnostic criteria and you know we have
2008,2008_122.txt,0,0.26182490587234497,those exact features,yeah and you know the other piece i would also say is that um these patients like in some ways they also have a little more of a feeling like somebody with a personality disorder and i don’t i don’t mean that in like a negative kind of stigma way that people sometimes take that what i mean is there is just to something about its really unique about these patients is that whole issue of wanting and maintaining control um and and that’s where you know i joke we do we run groups down here and more as a service to the community because there’s nobody else who provides treatment for hoarding in city  and um and just because i’m i don’t have that much personnel down here and so i i've trained some of our senior undergraduate students to help kind of facilitate these groups and hoarding patients love them and i always joke about the fact that they love them more than they love talking to me talking to be the quote on quote hoarding expert um and theses this aspect where they feel like their contributing to that students educations and that then directly feeds back to their sense of their own value and then they are more invested in that versus
2008,2008_122.txt,0,0.34616535902023315,that’s interesting input,if you know we have some of and in fact i think the undergrads do better that some of my graduate students especially the graduate students who come from having done like a social anxiety group or even like a ocd group where you know its much more kind of didactic where it's like ‘well today were going to be doing our exposure and this is how exposures work now let’s design your exposure and let’s go do it’ and the patients like ‘okay’ LAUGHING you know?
2008,2008_122.txt,0,0.6685357093811035,LAUGHING no its okay its very interesting,i'm bad at listing LAUGHING
2008,2008_123.txt,0,0.4160028100013733,so the last list prompt that we had was can you list reasons people might seek treatment for hoarding disorder,so why they might not why they might not?
2008,2008_123.txt,0,0.4545481503009796,why they might,uhuh well okay so i mean the obvious one would be because their forced to by some outside entities and i think that can be very concrete you may be evicted um your landlord is making you do this um you just discovered half of your floor has been eaten away by termites and you have to have they house fumigated and you can’t because your stuff is in there so really concrete serious things all the was to subtle things um kind of uh carrots if you will like ‘my daughter said she wont let me play with the grandkids anymore’ um or you know i i have a new boyfriend and i'm embarrassed to like bring him to my house so these theses external um you know reinforces again i think they range from really kind of concrete severe um things that could happen but then they range to more subtle features as well um those are i think they main reasons i think that people come in but then there are other ones too like ‘i'm worried what will happen to my stuff when i die’ that’s another reason i think that people come in um and i think those are kind of the main reasons
2008,2008_123.txt,0,0.5688158869743347,so with that we can get started with the interview and kind of the first thing we like to as everyone is uh what’s your background related to hoarding disorder and what’s your educational background and your past,yeah so so i i fell into hoarding when i was actually before i went to graduate school so i was biochemistry major as an undergrad and i was headed to medical school to go into psychiatry and then like my senior year i i in the spring of my senior year i was like ‘i don’t i don’t think i want to go to medical school’ so i took some time off and worked in a lab for the nih with a guy by the name of name  um name  has since passed away but he was one of he’s a real great in the ocd world um you know like name  and um name  and name  and and a ton of people that their post-doc training with name  and so you know he had a focus on looking at the serotonin transporter gene so there was a genetics lab kind of more neuroscience slash genetics portion and then they also did family studies of patients with ocd um but i kind of got interested in the ocd portion even though i was there to do more of the animal studies with uh the serration transporter not that inaudible  but i became really fascinated by these patients with ocd and their families um and and even early on and this was like forever ago right this was 2001 yeah like 2001 2002 2003 um there were these patients that were you know with in the pile of heterogeneity of ocd that weren’t behaving how all the rest were so they were they didn’t respond to treatment psychotherapy as well they they messed up all of the genetics results LAUGHING they were just a huge pain in the butt and so name  was one of the first uh labs to really adopt name  and name ’s saving inventory revised to so with in his sample of ocd um we started looking at hoarding behaviors um so fast forward i decided to not go into neuroscience and not to go into medical school and i instead got my phd in clinical psychology and i did that at university  um with name  who is actually an anxiety researcher but um name  was great because he let me do whatever i wanted to and what i kept gravitating back to was ocd and then this like mystery group of patients um which was the focus of hoarding um so yeah so that’s my background so i'm a clinical psychologist and after i finished my phd i did all of my clinical internships and my postdoc up at university  uh with ocd and related disorders program up there and i've been down here at university  for the last eight years
2008,2008_125.txt,0,0.6376393437385559,and do you currently uh see patients with hoarding disorder or are you just conducting research?,so we’re uh its bazaar in uh in the world of clinical psych especially if your associated with a university in state  it’s the same way for other states as well but but um state  in particular i don’t actually have to be licensed LAUGHING so i personally do not see patients but within our group i mention to you we do my lab focuses um on risk and vulnerability across anxiety oc spectrum um so some of the work we do is looking at trans diagnosis risk factors um some of the work we do is focused on ocd and then probably a a third to a half of the work we do is focused on all things hoarding so as result of that um it’s a real conundrum down down here and considering how big of a city city  is um it's always shocking to me i mean i can barely find treatment provides for anxiety and ocd so for forget hoarding like there really isn’t anyone else um who does anything remotely helpful for these patients um and i'm not being a snotty academic uh who is over stating the reality of it it's really like tough down here so as a result of that we um do have on going groups that we provided which i then supervise and so that how i still have a lot of contact with patients um we do the facilitated self help group and then we do group therapy for hoarding patients um and then so that’s more cbt focused group therapy and then we also do individual therapy for hoarding patients
2008,2008_125.txt,0,0.6289103031158447,okay,again a long answer sorry guys
2008,2008_125.txt,0,0.6386199593544006,yeah no that’s okay um so just to kind of get started thinking of the issues in our interview and we’ve already talked a little about this but just to get us thinking about um about how clinicians think about hoarding right now and how you as a clinicians think about it the first question that we like to ask you related to related to this topic is just to have you talk through what the most important differences between normal saving behavior such as perhaps collecting and hoarding disorder are,great question so and i think that there um we just finished a study looking at the dimension of hoarding uh or rather saving behaviors um so that’s something that i'm very interested in because i'm particularly fascinated by who are these people when they are young?
2008,2008_126.txt,0,0.39755305647850037,you you're doing a study that is related to the kind of early lives of hoarders or are you more looking at this boundary between normal and abnormal saving behaviors what when you say that i'm not sure,both both
2008,2008_126.txt,0,0.2549187242984772,inaudible  okay so what specifically are you doing if you don’t mind,yeah so we well first of all i'm really interested in these young adults and college students are these really fascinating group because it’s the first time they are living alone but they are still living in this fairly controlled environments um so better understanding which of those students are doing to go on to become our eventual hoarding patients is is something that i'm really curious about and and importantly our core diagnosis criteria of clutter is absolutely worthless with that group of young adults cause they a haven’t had time to collect enough stuff and b they’re living in controlled environment they are living in like a two by two foot dorm room with a roommate LAUGHING um and so none of these students would meet for clutter like none of them so they wouldn’t get the diagnoses of hoarding so we absolutely see difficulties discarding um and a lot of the similar features that we see with like like clinical hoarding patients like the older patients we also see with these younger kids um so that’s part of it another study that we did but isn’t really related to that is that we recruited eighteen gender match healthy control and then collectors people who do not meet the diagnosis for hoarding but they have a collection and they identity has a collector and then hoarding disorder patients so we basically artificially created a dimension um by oversampling those three groups
2008,2008_127.txt,0,0.41832685470581055,that is really interesting i will be really interested to hear what you find um just kind of concretely how do you operationalize that in terms of when you look at a patent in front of you and you have to make that determination how do you make it clinically?,you mean like differentiating between the collector and the
2008,2008_127.txt,0,0.5977713465690613,mhm or the clutter the cluttered person who you know um who has a lot of stuff versus a hoarder versus somebody who has difficulties discarding but as you said maybe doesn’t have control over their space how do you when you're sitting with a patient um and you're not sure how do you determine if their saving behavior is normal or abnormal?,mhm yeah i think i mean uh partially what we want to do with this data is to try to get better at differentiating that so they way we recruited for that study was to use really strict exclusion inclusion criteria if you’re in the hoarding group you have to meet for dsm five criteria for hoarding disorder okays so it's pretty strict how we define that inclusion with the healthy controls you have to have to not meet that diagnosis and you have to be below the means of that sir okay so with in the like normative healthy range of on the saving inventory revised and then for the collectors the only criteria we used for them was that they could not meet the criteria for hoarding disorder which most of them did not meet for two reasons one they didn’t have the clutter and then two they had difficulties discarding but only with respect to the thing they collected let me tell you there are so many weird collections out there LAUGHING that alone was fascination um like they guy who collected fire hydrants he had a hard time he had extreme difficulty discarding his fire hydrants LAUGHING but he did not have a difficulty discarding anything else
2008,2008_127.txt,0,0.3760208189487457,okay so perhaps these is inaudible  making this distinction there is an element of knowing being able to value some things over others,mhm but we’ll see if that holds true right because we’re going to look at the data dimensionally and and i would not characterize collectors a healthy
2008,2008_127.txt,0,0.3994603455066681,great so perhaps it’s a spectrum as well,yeah for sure and and ya know that’s good that’s we did a inaudible  study on hoarding and it at least looking at the least and looking at difficulties discarding and clutter it is a dimension
2008,2008_127.txt,0,0.44351643323898315,great,tts is a spectrum it's not that there is a latten taxon on hoarding versus non hoarding
2008,2008_127.txt,0,0.37586891651153564,yeah and it’s a confidential interview so don’t be like i said the idea is to gage where people where the field is and what we know right now what we what are inaudible,yeah no no no i understand
2008,2008_127.txt,0,0.3507305085659027,well we don’t need an evidence based citation for what you're about to say,well so who do i think about who is in our trial and who is in our research protocols it is older females who are sterility educated but economically lower sef
2008,2008_128.txt,0,0.2689886689186096,mhm,they tend to be like higher levels of loneliness like maybe they have um a few core group friends but there are interpersonal relationships that you maybe would typically expect that they no longer have so perhaps estranged from family and what not um they tend to be white do i think that those are only
2008,2008_128.txt,0,0.519705593585968,are they more located in cities or uh suburbs or the country?,no i think they are everywhere and i mean that defiantly comes from my i mean we would like in city  hoarding patients would come out of the woodwork like you would advertise for like a washing study and you would have all these hoarding patients um a i’ve had a harder time recruiting hoarding down here in city  than i have anywhere else and i think part of that has to do with that our city is over sixty-five percent latino
2008,2008_128.txt,0,0.4456677734851837,hm,and do i think that we don’t have hoarding in those populations?
2008,2008_128.txt,0,0.49060285091400146,inaudible  seek treatment yeah,all the dudes are getting lost
2008,2008_128.txt,0,0.32939350605010986,mhm,but it's not just seeking treatment like that’s why i keep emphasizing like not just our treatment study but also our research protocol in both of those places we see primarily females older females
2008,2008_128.txt,0,0.5216880440711975,so do you think that’s a that’s a question with insight or identifying as a person with a problem with clutter or hoarding do you think it’s a higher level of stigma?,all of the above probably right and then i think there’s probably another factor which is that i mean don’t know maybe more of these dudes are like living with partners who are cleaning up after them and basically keeping the clutter at bay?
2008,2008_128.txt,0,0.4928545355796814,interesting um so i just want to bring this up because uh i i don’t want us to get crunched for time i know we can talk up until  and we both want to be respectful of your time but i think that probably we’re not going to be able to make it through all of our questions and i'm wondering if it's possible to uh just get as far as we get and the schedule another time with you to to continue or follow up?,sure we can do that
2008,2008_129.txt,0,0.6462132930755615,yeah okay um so just the last part of that question was just to have you think through and this is just a useful exercise because it makes it very concrete um to think through a specific case or cases that was challenging for you to diagnose either clinically or in research because it was on the border between pathological and non pathological behavior um perhaps it was almost sub-clinical or for other reasons perhaps it was it was similar to another mental health disorder and on that border or again you give the example of one you don’t have cluttered house but you know had clutter in storage spaces so could you think of a specific case that was challenging for any of those reason and kind of talk through how you end up making the decision,yeah sure i mean that the um if you hadn’t asked me about a specific case and just asked me what do i think is the biggest problem with the diagnostic criteria um for me it comes down to two things the first is the clutter criterion um i think the clutter criterion is fascination because it's almost like if we were to translate that to like ocd for example it would be like saying ‘let me see your hands are they bloody enough?
2008,2008_129.txt,0,0.22821925580501556,right right,um but that’s what we do with hoarding so i think that it is a huge problem in a situation like a person who lives in a studio with their partner and they have that living space cluttered up do they have more severe hoarding or less severe that the person who is rich and has fifteen storage units and two homes that they have filled up but their current home is spick and span and beautiful
2008,2008_130.txt,0,0.719974935054779,mhm,inaudible
2008,2008_130.txt,0,0.4251733124256134,literally our next question was going to be for you to talk exactly about that issue so you're,oh --
2008,2008_130.txt,0,0.41845813393592834,like we’re thinking along the same lines yeah so how do you how do you do that how do you decide how do you operate with that criteria and this is literally how do you do it in your practice?,yeah so is this like for the treatment or like our groups that we run um i'm super flexible with the clutter criterion because i just think that if somebody’s telling me that they are distressed and impaired because of their attachment to objects regardless to whether that results in clutter that is at the level the is required based on the dsm i will let them in for our research study it’s a lot more challenging um so you know because people want to know if oh you define hoarding disorder like it is in the dsm then you have to make sure that they meet that way so basically what i've been doing is doing like a shadow um definition which is to really hone in on the difficulties discarding as the kind of primary diagnostic criterion because it its and issue our field is going to have to grapple with in um and i think especially as we start to look at hoarding across the globe i think these where it's going to be particularly relevant um if you put me living in a camper trailer it's automatically going to feel more cluttered even though i'm not a cluttered person right you know then if you put me in a special you know five bedroom like mansion space and how much access we have to space is something we have to think about i don’t think there’s any clear cut answers right now and then the other diagnostic criteria i have a huge issue with um is the acquiring um so identifying acquiring as uh the specified and i just i'm just like ‘hang on a moment’ okay so we have a patient who has full blown hoarding but the don’t have acquiring so they say no to acquiring nine time out of ten those patients are either actively avoiding any sort of situation where they may be tempted to acquire or they’ve run out of money okay like they literally can’t like they are barely feeding themselves and their family um or there’s some other like kind of extenuating circumstance like i've never purchased things and then you find out all their like of our magazines disappear from that waiting groom every time that patient stops by and so i think that its is it doesn’t allow for a nuanced description of uh the acquiring issue in hoarding and just because you are avoiding something does not mean you do not have a problem with acquiring you have a really big problem with acquiring but we live in a very materialistic world so your constantly exposed to stuff so those are my two bones that i have to pick with LAUGHING
2008,2008_130.txt,0,0.7074384689331055,with the criteria yeah what about this issue of telling hoarding from other mental health disorders so you know there are several types hoarding some of them mentioned are obsessive compulsive disorder also depression sometimes that patients get very upset,i don’t i don’t the hoarding depression distinctions that difficult i think that’s pretty easy um but the one that i think does get a little bit tricky is if they have ocd and hoarding um and being able to like tease apart which hoarding behavior is linked to ocd verses what is linked to hoarding disorder i think that gets a little bit tricky
2008,2008_131.txt,0,0.49055156111717224,we had a participant like that yesterday actually inaudible  that you mentioned that it is very challenging,yeah interesting mhm
2008,2008_131.txt,0,0.5075361132621765,mhm inaudible,inaudible  what i say to my students is that if you go back to why are they saving?
2008,2008_131.txt,0,0.7735705375671387,yeah exactly so you had brought up the dsm five criteria and we actually have some specific questions that we want to ask you about the specific elements in the dsm five criterion and how you imply them and employ them in your practice and your research so uh the first phrase that we wanted to mention was persistent difficulty discarding or parting possession regardless of their values and so with this we kind of wanted to get you how you’re deeming value and what makes the values judgment a hoarding patient makes inappropriate?,um i mean so the way that we usually first we always ask if they have any difficulties with discarding um objects or belongings and if the person says yes to that we always ask for examples um what are the types of things you have difficulties discarding and um if someone were to say my faberge eggs or LAUGHING i don’t know whatever my you know my eighteen hundreds stamp collection um then we would ask the follow up question are there any other types of objects you have a hard time letting go of um so i thick there is a very obvious aspect of value that has to do with just in general with most people think that that something you should hang on to um and and if not then i kind of seeing how extensive it is like are there multiple objects um i think that’s really kind of the crux its not only that they have a hard time discarding um baggies for or the only have a hard time discarding take out containers like a hoarding patient has difficulties discarding a range of objects and again that threshold for how many of these objects they have is tends to be a lot higher then yes i sometimes save takeout containers as well but i have maybe like two of them versus you know so many that you have this cluttered living space
2008,2008_132.txt,0,0.41259294748306274,so it seems like its crux of thing to which they are applying that distorted value judgment to and there’s also an aspect that you mentioned of that there is a cultural or societal norm for what things have value and i'm curious to whether that monetary value or emotional values or atheistic values which of these are we talking about?,um i think that i think it i think it depends i don’t think we have really good answered for that yet um if you go with that example of the woman i just talked about where she had the five storage units so she the part that i didn’t mention was she lived in a house boat actually okay so she lives in a very small space basically the size of a camper um and the stuff that’s in the storage facilities is is all of her parents old belonging um and she’s you know also part of the context here is she’s like i think sixty-six or something like that um and her parents died like about twenty years ago and and so in those twenty years she has kept paying for those five storage units she has gotten divorced she has loss a home she has been displaced because of hurricanes like all these things have happened to her she has hung on to those storage units um she also really part of the reason she’s on the boat is she’s financially super super strapped she’s on medicaid um and a lot of people including her adult children have suggested she should go through those storage units because there may be something of value in there that she could actually sell to try to get her off of the boat and into um a you know a kind of normal apartment or home um and so that would be an example of where she probably has some valuable stuff right so i think another element that you have to factor in is how much do you hang on to stuff even if it is of value despite reasons that would indicate that you should see or discard or do something with them does that make sense?
2008,2008_132.txt,0,0.380323588848114,yeah totally that’s a lot that a lot for that criteria that a lot of work inaudible  diagnostic work behind that criteria you know it leaves a lot,yeah
2008,2008_132.txt,0,0.5612779259681702,on the shoulders of the clinician,absolutely which is another thing that brings me back to why i am so fascinated to think about your average physician right who who maybe only ever seen advertisements for buried alive what are they going to do with these criteria like how are they determining this?
2008,2008_132.txt,0,0.4474611282348633,and it is very interesting again kind of to move in the interview to talking about the interview process just from my perspective just from listening to these interviews the very different ideas that people have about there diagnostic criteria i mean they go from thinking there’s a lot of nuance to very little nuance just in the few interviews we’ve done so far we’ve done about eight so far and we have really seen a range i don’t know if you agree with that name  but it is very surprising to me the different ways clinicians talk about this criteria,i wonder if a lot of that is going to come down to mds
2008,2008_132.txt,0,0.7294638156890869,yeah,versus
2008,2008_133.txt,0,0.34685662388801575,that’s part of what we've been wondering if it is a doctor thing is it a you know perhaps the background in ocd or if you are background in social work or i don’t know but it will be very interesting to look i think at at the end to see why that is,mhm
2008,2008_133.txt,0,0.6202809810638428,yeah,so sorry to interrupt name
2008,2008_133.txt,0,0.49775561690330505,no uh we were going to ask you exactly what you had answered us already,okay
2008,2008_133.txt,0,0.519925057888031,determination as to how much stuff is is too much depending on things like house size um you know a lot of factors with that but we also wanted to ask since we kind of already talked about it i'm just going to loop by that question if it's okay um but we also wanted to ask about the idea of um substantially compromised use um and how you view as a clinician what the patients intent for the space might be um i don’t know if that make sense as a question you know like uh the example that we give is if a person doesn’t cook what is the the intended use of their kitchen and what’s a normal intended use,mhm right yeah yeah no like uh the little lady who’s awesome she ninety-two she’s done all of our studies she still wicked smart she love to entertain she's got this group of lady friends that she likes to have over and they play bridge she gets all of her meals delivered she does not need her kitchen because of her you know physically she’s she’s rather compromised just because of her age so she'd rather and she doesn’t really sleep in a bed anymore she sleep in a one of those lazy boy recliners because it helps her get up um so you know her bedroom is just a storage facility that’s what it is her kitchen is just another closet she doesn't need it for anything uh she has access to the sink and she has access the fridge which is really she has access to her microwave and that what really all she needs um so do we give her that criterion or not?
2008,2008_133.txt,0,0.4586612284183502,and there are other things that kind of have to come into that judgment,yeah
2008,2008_134.txt,0,0.4400268495082855,um you kind of mentioned something that leads into a second question that we have that relates to space uh so for healthy individuals even there is a degree of variance in the amount of space that you like in your home so some might like to have a clear desk while others might prefer to have things out and ready to use do you feel like hoarding disorder could be an extension of that variance that surpasses the acceptable threshold you know we had another interviewer say ‘some people just want to be surrounded by their things’ and live more cave like if you will you mentioned that word,yeah totally i think it's a spectrum i don’t think we are looking at an extreme taxon here
2008,2008_134.txt,0,0.6582165360450745,okay the last criterion yeah just to i think we’ll wrap up the questions we had about the dsm five and then we’ll get another time on your calendar if that’s okay um the last criteria we wanted to have to talk through for us was the just the difficulties with the perceived need to save the items and the distress associated with discarding them and we wanted to talk about how you determine the distress with this disorder how do you determine how much distress with discarding is normal or abnormal is it a grey area and in particular is a grey area for patients that might have low insight and not really be aware of how difficult they have um the difficulties they have with discarding,um i think it probably becomes a grey area for sub-clinical folks but i i usually don’t find it so grey for people who definitely have hoarding disorder
2008,2008_134.txt,0,0.6794754862785339,mhm,um i think that inaudible
2008,2008_134.txt,0,0.29801860451698303,inaudible  go ahead,the part when i'm training like you know my super newbie graduate students is that they have it in their mind that distress comes in like one from so we do have to talk about that distress can come in the guise as anger can come in the guise and anxiety can come in the guise as like grief you know there’s like a range of emotion that can reflect or capture that distress and as long as you are kind of thinking about it in that perspective then you know then i think that the other part that probably is when it does kind of start to get tricky is when they haven’t been exposed to having to discard right like it has not occurred to them that they need to get rid of anything um and so they haven’t really elicited the distress um in any sort of concrete way
2008,2008_134.txt,0,0.7790310382843018,yeah,sure yeah no that works
2008,2008_134.txt,0,0.46911346912384033,i think that the question is kind of moving forward now is how we might want to collaborate on this project how we might move forward,let me say well can we hold on before i answer that i'm just looking at my calendar so i'm actually okay to go for another half an hour if you guys want to power through but if you need to go we can wrap up
2008,2008_135.txt,0,0.5011689066886902,okay well good let’s keep going,yeah lets maybe do that because uh its uh its going to be a really busy next couple of weeks for me so um yeah okay perfect so insight is really
2008,2008_135.txt,0,0.6464502811431885,yeah,sorry i'm just jumping
2008,2008_135.txt,0,0.30448639392852783,no go go for it,so so insight is very interesting because obviously it's like the i don’t get that i have a problem and its so not on my radar and the extremes of that we have squalor and animal hoarding but i really think of those as kind of being something kinda different like it just kind of feels very different um almost a little bit more like psychosis um your more garden variety hoarding disorder patient will also have variable insight but the thing that i find so fascinating about that insight is that it is so variable and its like this floating insight an it think that it we don’t have a good way of defining what exactly it is like we haven’t fully operationalized what we mean by insight and you know there’s the part where it like ‘yeah i know i have a issue and i can acknowledge that but i really like my stuff and so you push too much on my stuff um i'm going to push back again with that’ right?
2008,2008_136.txt,0,0.2898278832435608,that’s really interesting um so we want to talk a little bit more about a couple of the things that you said um so one of the things that you mentioned that we’ve been thinking about is kind of the way you could or might operationalize inside of this population uh and we listed a paper that had kind of broken down the the different constructs that are and we wanted you to just kind of talk through the extent that you think that these constructs are useful with your patients so i’ll just read you the list and and we can go through them one by one or you can talk about any one of them that you think is more or less interesting so the constructs that we listed we’re defensiveness um agnosia which is just like a lack of ability to perceive the illness or whether something is wrong overvalued ideation which is the persistent and unreal belief in the potential value of items indifferent and indifference is the last one so defensiveness agnosia overvalued ideation and indifference um so just thinking through those as potential kind of pieces or parts of insight do you think that any of them are more or less important in this disorder um for different qualifications different times and how would you use those ideas to come up with a more concrete idea of insight?,what paper is that?
2008,2008_136.txt,0,0.5523174405097961,um i think it’s uh a inaudible  from uh i i can’t remember,oh of course it is name
2008,2008_136.txt,0,0.29361099004745483,yeah,i’ll have to read that again um i think defensiveness and overvalued ideation are relevant across the board i think indifference can be relevant and and that part about just have a complete like you're just really not able to recognize that it’s a problem yeah i think that’s really relevant for something like squalor or animal hoarding and i guess it could also be relevant for object hoarding it just i think less common
2008,2008_136.txt,0,0.4736442565917969,uhuh and kind of thinking through again um the process of gaining and the patients being maybe being at different levels of insight at different times do you think that theses different kind of insight are relevant at all to that idea?,yeah because like the defensiveness like if you are tapping on something or like i guess i think of the defensiveness as kind of going along with the control idea um i guess maybe just something that just isn’t capturing so well is i do think is an issue with some patients is that they don’t have the same definition for what is a clean home or what’s like an uncluttered space so those would be like patients who your showing them a clutter image rating and they’re like ‘oh my god look at this room that’s a nine this is horrible how could somebody live like that’ and then you ask them what their living room looks like and their like ‘oh it think it might be like a seven’ LAUGHING and it like inaudible
2008,2008_136.txt,0,0.7806761860847473,inaudible  most people don’t live at a seven,inaudible  don’t live at seven but like seven and a nine aren’t really that different to me so LAUGHING
2008,2008_136.txt,0,0.38585397601127625,so that’s another aspect of insight that is represented here is kind of seeing their behavior um on a scale of normal,yeah
2008,2008_137.txt,0,0.3877898156642914,and it's not just about overvalued ideation it's about how much how a space should look how a normal home looks like,yeah exactly mhm
2008,2008_137.txt,0,0.657592236995697,that is important and i think that you are right um so one interesting idea that we’ve heard about this i just want to kind of run by you is that there is a difficulty for clinicians sometimes when talking about insight and that um there’s two things going on one thing is recognizing that the behavior is a problem and the other is the behavior itself so um there’s insight in that you know the behavior problematic but then there’s also insight that you have to know that you know that the saving you shouldn’t save so i don’t know if i'm phrasing that well but it something that came up in our most recent interview is that there’s a degree that insight its kind of part of hoarding disorder if you really know that you shouldn’t save stuff um then there is another level that is able to get rid of it level its very difficult to distinguish i don’t know if i'm making this inaudible,no i think that whoever said that is spot on i think that a really important distinction it would be like you know with with hurricane irma we had a lot of patients call us you know before the storm and just say ‘i just wish it would just take it all away i wish the storm would come in and just take it all away’ i would not say that all of those patients were the most kind of um high on insight but it really kind of reflects this part like ‘okay great i recognize that i have a problem but i don’t recognize that i have control over my behavior’
2008,2008_137.txt,0,0.6938751935958862,mhm mhm,i think that inaudible
2008,2008_137.txt,0,0.45461133122444153,inaudible  – would be better without this stuff but still,yeah
2008,2008_138.txt,0,0.5219264626502991,yeah i think that’s a really interesting too um so if you just to kind of return to the questions we skipped sorry about that name  kind jumping all over the place um so if you were to think about your conversations with patients um how would you how do you try to help a patient gain insight or how do you try to help patients recognize things about this concept of insight that might be able to recognize in treatment what do you say to um to get them there?,well one of the things that i think about a lot to capitalize on where they’re at so there was something well let me backup i take a very mi approach to this so that’s probably the simplest way to answer that so you you kind of roll with the resistance but you try to them really flesh out um their potential reasons for change the potential barriers to change and and the ultimate hope would be you are going to kind of increase this readiness for change kind of like mental preparedness for change um but i i really keep that in mind throughout treatment with hoarding patients because there are going to be weeks where whatever it is that you are sorting is going to be sorting is going to um it it's just going to be tougher and so maybe you're just going to have more of a challenge that week than than others so just kind of rolling with that resistance and helping the patient can navigate that um an making it okay that you understand um you know similar to someone one with subs abuse there’s a reason why they are using there’s a reason why our patients are saving their stuff and those reasons aren’t bad
2008,2008_138.txt,0,0.4080859124660492,mhm,the behavior the result is not helpful but the reason behind right it we shouldn’t necessarily judge
2008,2008_138.txt,0,0.33688780665397644,ham interesting and just to kind of carry that a step further um one thing that we heard from some other clinician is that um by the time the patients come to them they already they kind of by definition already have some insight as to what’s going on so if you can just think through in your experience what that process before patients you know are necessarily self identifying as hoarders or are coming in for studies or treatment what that process of gaining insight on their own has looked like for your patients,yeah you know the person who inaudible
2008,2008_138.txt,0,0.26566681265830994,inaudible,definitely talk to is name  and i'm goanna if you haven’t already reached out to name  i'm going to send you his email um name  runs the housing up in city  and name  has i think really different insight because he’s reaching patients through the department of housing before they self identify um and so i think that his perspective about you know how does insight and motivation for treatment how does that all play out is is really different from those of us who are kind of in a little bit more um i don’t know uh elitist type of treatment programs right where by the time somebody has called within the greater city  community they have found their way to the study of anxiety stress and ocd at the university  i mean they absolutely already have some insight um now not everybody is ready for what it takes to do this treatment which is probably why i kind of have this unspoken rule that everybody has to do the facilitated self help group first and then they kind of work up to the cbt group and then they work up to the individual therapy um sometimes we break that rule but rarely and i think part of it is we have them do the self help group first to try to figure out ‘are you really ready for this?’ um do you have to have enough kind of motivation to kind of push through uh those tough times
2008,2008_139.txt,0,0.3359607458114624,mhm mhm and um i we’ll reach our reach out to you at the end of the interview for contact information that something we intended to do you listed and get names from you and i think you're right he would have a really different perspective on how patients,yeah
2008,2008_139.txt,0,0.5425962805747986,come to this because you see some other inaudible,and you know what
2008,2008_139.txt,0,0.5222625732421875,mhm,name  treatment outcomes look better than ours
2008,2008_139.txt,0,0.6977167129516602,interesting,yeah
2008,2008_139.txt,0,0.44324928522109985,yeah and like,and you got that carrot you’ve got the carrot of you're going to lose your voucher if you don’t do this
2008,2008_139.txt,0,0.8363093137741089,mhm,yeah
2008,2008_139.txt,0,0.7605228424072266,yeah i think that the last question i had for you from the insight topic is uh when you're describing a patient with having low insight um what does that mean for you how are you defining insight?,well i think it's basically what i you know what i kind of touched on before is that for low insight it would mean either there is an aspect that they cannot recognize right they’re like looking at the dead birds that they have collected and they’re like ‘they are happy and healthy’ like they do not recognize that they have a problem um that’s obviously an extreme example but but then it think that the other way i would define insight is this variable insight which would be more of that defensiveness the overvalued ideation and then the indifference piece like ‘what’s it to you that my house it cluttered?’ um i think clinicians constantly get in to trouble when we want to get them like to a one on the clutter image rating and they’re totally fine being at a four right like ‘what’s the big deal?’ um so yeah
2008,2008_140.txt,0,0.6068615317344666,how do you think your patients or the research subjects that you see would reply to those to that question?,uh i think that that i think it differs depending on the education level the patients have you could get some pretty different answerer to that question um but i think that the general answer that most of my patients would say is that ‘i've always liked stuff i don’t know where that came from but i've always liked it’
2008,2008_140.txt,0,0.669517457485199,and you think that that changes over the course of coming to understand they really have a disorder or do you think that that is pretty constant um i guess what i'm trying to get at is do you think that the process of getting insight changes this?,um i don’t know if insight would change that answer i mean certainly if they
2008,2008_140.txt,0,0.24629274010658264,inaudible,been through our group and we’ve told them that it is you know we we find that a lot of our patients feel a lot of relief um from having been told that there’s a lot of this you know that notion about you had a lot of cards in the deck that kind of predisposed you to developing this um they feel really relieved by that
2008,2008_140.txt,0,0.5991566777229309,ham okay the next question that we wanted to ask was if you had to asked patients who argue that they need to keep these things that something bad will come from discarding them how do you think they would respond to that?,well that sounds like a very ocd focused question that’s maybe the researcher commenting on that i think a lot of our patients if we were to ask them about that like something bad will happen i think that if our patients have ocd hoarding then they will be like ‘yes’ and then if they have hoarding because of hoarding disorder they’d be like ‘what do you mean something bad is going to happen well maybe i mean i don’t want to be wasteful’ but i think that question wont make as much sense to them like if i were to ask you guys ‘why do you you know keep your old note or why do you keep a card that you know your partner gave you on your last anniversary like are you afraid that something bad will happen if you get rid of it?
2008,2008_140.txt,0,0.5023409724235535,so that kind of fear or anxiety based for you are a big part of the difference between ocd hoarding and hoarding,yeah one thing where that’s different i think like the one exception for that is that we have a lot of patients that are really worried about like the environment and not wanting to be wasteful but its its not tied to the specific object but it's more because they have a really strong belief that to be good citizens of this world
2008,2008_141.txt,0,0.5076556205749512,and they might have more inaudible  something will happen if i let this object go,yeah
2008,2008_141.txt,0,0.49669045209884644,yeah okay um so now there’s another question that we kind of already discussed about uh postdoc reasons and um something else that you’ve already mentioned that is another question that we wanted to ask is do you think that cultural forces that associating back to values and self worth consumption and material possessions play any role in the development of hoarding disorder what kind of role do you think that plays?,ah man i don’t know i don’t know i think it obviously has to be part of it and you know as the world is changing but you know hold on let me give you guys an example of why i always get stuck on this um i was speaking with a woman who just completed a stent with doctors without borders and so she's working in like rural ethiopia and this woman came to her clinic and was um crying and really really upset and was like ‘nobody can help me with my husband’ um and and it’s the way that it works in that part of ethiopia two level homes and basement the ground floor is where all the animals would stay at night so all the goats and what not wouldn’t be picked off by wild animals um so then the family lives up on the second level and so with one woman went on to describe the fact that her husband is collecting all sorts of like containers and like extra clothing pieces and potential building supplies and like all of this stuff that when it was described to me sounds sure a lot like what my patients tend to acquire um and collect and save um and and he basically filed the entire bottom level of their home and so the reason she was upset was that they had already had like three of their goats killed because they were no longer within the protection of the of the home and so is is because of materialism?
2008,2008_142.txt,0,0.6598498821258545,mhm um okay so the last piece of the interview we’d like to go through with you is again about the way that patients come in to treatment or come in for um for studies um an just based on your experience we’ve kind of covered some of this already so um i don’t want to make you repeat yourself too much but just when thinking of a patient or just kind of in the form of a narrative could you please describe the typical process that usually occurs to get patients to your office either for treatment or for study and participation what happens in your experiences to patients before they get there?,um i think that it is very different depending on whether its for a research study or whether its for a treatment reason um and so for research study i i find that a lot of these patients are kind of interested and intrigued about learning stuff and being part of a bigger thing and so for research um you know as long as they kind of have the whereabouts to self identify and say ‘oh i many have this hoarding thing’ um then we find it pretty easy to have them come in um they are also the only patient groups i've ever worked with where people are you know often enough where it's noticeable um they refuse payment LAUGHING like ‘no no it's okay take the money’ they’re like ‘no i want to just help contribute to science’ you know it's like that’s great good thank you um for the treatment piece of it i oftentimes think they have reached a certain point where they are in distress or impairment or the like griping from outside forces has reached high enough threshold where it's finally become pain enough for the patient to come in so i think the conversation is really different but even then they aren’t always ready to purse cbt treatment um in which case you know then uh well that’s part of the reason we have them go though the help group first and then the cbt group
2008,2008_142.txt,0,0.5972232818603516,um so just in terms of the motivations that they have do you feel like the people who are involved in getting them to your office are most frequently um like family members and friends and if so which family members in in particular do you find are the most involved with this process?,um well what’s interesting is that when we have family members call um usually those are folks that the patients themselves are super not ready to change and then if its cases where the patients themselves is calling in um often times we don’t in those cases work with the family does that make sense?
2008,2008_142.txt,0,0.6171936392784119,so if the family’s calling then usually it's because the patient won't but if the patient is ready we don’t really hear from the families as much,right the the few exceptions to that is if the patient is living with their family
2008,2008_143.txt,0,0.5991537570953369,and you say exceptions because usually these individuals are living by themselves?,yeah or they’re just living with their like you know partner their husband or their wife um but in cases where especially down here in city  we have a couple of patients i'm thinking about where their multigenerational living in under the same roof um and so the hoarding is impacting more than just their partner and so those were the few exceptions that i had in mind where the patients is the one who seeks treatment where we had then had like a family meeting
2008,2008_143.txt,0,0.30797407031059265,mhm just because the other individuals will be directly impacted and will be kind of helping them to live without their stuff or to discard,yeah
2008,2008_143.txt,0,0.259599506855011,um you mentioned the case of you know people who are come into hoarding treatment because of social service workers or because of they are going to be evicted um so i guess i'm wondering in comparison with with the people who are brought in by their families um you know you had mentioned earlier that they their outcomes are better because they are going to lose their vouchers so do you think there is a different process for patients who kind of come in to contact with or have to to make these decisions because of forced by an institution or state entity?,mhm yeah i think i think when you guys talk to name  i think that will be really interesting for you
2008,2008_143.txt,0,0.44593560695648193,mhm you think that a pretty different process for them?,yes because
2008,2008_143.txt,0,0.33014237880706787,because they don’t have any control at that point,i mean if you think about our treatment our treatment is not rocket science and its also not like in some ways it’s not mount everest it's like okay you're going to discard your stuff you're going to practice discarding your stuff were going to create a hierarchy that you use and we’re going to work our way all the way up and them maybe we will throw in some you know cognitive remediation and maybe we’ll throw in some like cognitive therapy to target those beliefs but its not that its like that challenging you ask anyone who works with hoarding patients what its challenging i would be shocked if not on one of their top ten list is getting them to do their homework and telling them to do it um so i think that that’s the part where the external forces is just so instrumental because it just helps in um you know but i say that but there’s some days like they still name ’s group has tried a token economy an that you know works just about as well as everything else we do ie not that impressively um and so i do think there’s something about it being very kind of hard concrete external reinforce-er i don’t know i’ll be curious about what you guys say after you talk to name
2008,2008_143.txt,0,0.464083731174469,yeah i think that that will be an interesting interview for us um and we’ll get in contact with him i think i'm not sure if i can find him i just looked him up and i didn’t email address so,i’ll i’ll send it to you
2008,2008_143.txt,0,0.5614211559295654,inaudible  later,yeah i’ll send it to you
2008,2008_144.txt,0,0.6486884951591492,okay um well that the bulk of our interview right there um we just wanted to kind of close out with a very broad kind of general question um what you think that the biggest things that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder are or uh if you could answer one question about hoarding disorder which one would you pick where you think the most important research could be,oh my god um i’ll be here forever if i answer that but i really don’t know i think it's so fascinating its like you know i started studying it almost by accident back in like you know early 2000’s and here i am still looking at it um i think that the most important that thing we can do in navigating hoarding research in moving forward is getting out of the mindset of this being an oc spectrum disorder um i think that it hoarding has grown up so much um from with in the shadow of of ocd that is has shaped a lot of how we conceptualize this condition and how we conceptualize the symptoms and the inaudible  and the validity everything an the more that we are learning about hoarding the more i think that we need to stop doing that it is almost like this perfect storm disorder where you get you know high levels of depression high levels of anxiety you have these personality features you have executive function deficits you have like everything um and it just i think that part of the reason why it's so challenging um yeah but so i i don’t make me pick one answer LAUGHING
2008,2008_144.txt,0,0.4146549701690674,okay that’s that’s fair um and we talked about a lot of different issues too over the course of this interview um i really appreciate your time and and um this was just really a great interview and um i think that a lot of the things that you have it was great and um validity and wonderful to have you kind of predict the questions that we were going to ask because i think that uh we’re interested in uh the same kind of questions in terms of insight and in terms of how the diagnostic criteria are applied um i don’t know if you want to talk now about next steps for us um or if,i mean i think
2008,2008_144.txt,0,0.45808136463165283,want to think about it,i think that um so so where i'm at right is that if there’s a role for me as a your collaborator or you know more lose consultant um i'm i i certainly think that this is really important and have been wanting to do something along these lines for for a while so i'm game but i but also so you guys are also at a point of study where maybe you don’t really need any more cooks in the kitchen that’s perfectly okay and we could re-circle you know once you know maybe um that fact that maybe you could use some these interviews to really develop a larger survey um to you know kind of think about interviewing different types of folks not just experts but the people who are actually because there are such few experts so who are the people who are interacting with these patients on a daily basis?
2008,2008_145.txt,0,0.27719277143478394,um how should we put this to patients?’ you know and how do we act as kind of uh a consultant or kind of advisor particularly if we move into the patient interview component um which hopefully we will be doing um at the end of the summer and the fall um and so if you would be interested in that we would,yeah sure
2008,2008_145.txt,0,0.3249340057373047,really value your input as we because its all kind of taking shape the the wonderful thing about qualitative methodology from my perspective is its very exploratory it lets you cast a really broad net and that something that kind of where we are right now we’re going to kind of take stock of what we’ve caught in that board net and see what pieces are interesting and when we get to that it would be,no that sounds perfect
2008,2008_145.txt,0,0.35405224561691284,helpful to touch base with you again and say you know we really want to understand this is something that we found in our interviews and we really want to understand better how should we how should we move on to the next stage or how do we get at that um,yeah no that sounds great really good
2008,2008_145.txt,0,0.32785144448280334,yeah,i would be super interested in that um and and very much game and so yeah even also in sifting through these interviews if i can be help for that especially since you know name  will be providing more of like an md perspective and then i would be providing more of like a psychology uh clinical psychologist perspective so that could be helpful in that
2008,2008_146.txt,0,0.4086662530899048,that be inaudible  when we get to the data analysis stage that would be very very helpful i think,yeah and then the the last piece that i’ll say that we can kind of like you know file away an and remember for the the the future is that um you know if you do end up going towards the like patient interviews um that’s the part where i also you know i don’t have i have three graduate students who are working with me um but i have an army of undergraduates and some of them are the ones that do the hoarding groups um and so there they know about hoarding they’re trained and also they are clinically very adaptive because i selected them for the group so we could also think about that they may be able to help with the interviews that would be like a concrete way
2008,2008_146.txt,0,0.31032443046569824,yeah that would be helpful and we’ve also kind of wondered and this is perhaps another issue for another day um we’ve wondered how difficult it would be to recruit hoarders for these interviews um and have thought about perhaps seeing if we could recruit collaborators to help us find hoarders to interview so if you would be game um for that kind of role of collaboration with us as well we can talk about that you know we’d have to obviously figure it out before logistically and in terms of the irb um but um that might also be helpful depending on how our recruitment goes,yeah for sure for sure absolutely yeah and i mean you guys are just up the road so um so yeah
2008,2008_146.txt,0,0.4752444624900818,inaudible  speaking yeah,yeah that’s great well nice to make contact and nice to meet you guys
2008,2008_146.txt,0,0.4861157536506653,yeah and thank you so much again for your time with the interview we i think both enjoyed it and appreciated you your insight,yeah sorry if i was long winded
2008,2008_146.txt,0,0.34748324751853943,no no no not at all um its great and it's great that there are you know um there is definitely a spectrum to which degree people are kind of engaging with these issues and so we’ve had interviews with people who are relatively unwilling to engage and are like of like ‘why are you asking these questions?’ and then we have other people who are like ‘yes i think about this all the time’ and it's always gratifying to have that and we always get a lot out of them um,oh cool
2008,2008_146.txt,0,0.7973200082778931,we appreciate your time and thank you,you're so welcome
2008,2008_146.txt,0,0.5618083477020264,and we’ll be in touch over time to follow up with the next steps,that sounds great
2008,2008_146.txt,0,0.6608462333679199,thank you so much for your time again,okay bye bye
2009,2009_147.txt,0,0.6611127853393555,are there things about the dsm-5 criteria that you feel are sometimes challenging or particular elements that are difficult to apply where the different clinicians might apply differently?,"i think the dsm-5 criteria actually is quite well written, and the fact that they put insight and acquisition as specifiers rather than requirements is important."
2009,2009_147.txt,0,0.6006076335906982,"and that’s because the criteria almost necessitates a certain amount of time span, you think, to build up that degree of clutter, or?","i don’t know if its time spent or absence of external factors controlling it, or if it’s just the natural progression of the disorder, but… and obviously all the dsm criteria, all the dsm diagnoses requires a level of impairment or distress, but i think that the focus on clutter as one of the primary mechanisms of impairment is good at the severe end, but may not be good in the early stages."
2009,2009_147.txt,0,0.5453962087631226,"so with “persistent difficulty discarding or parting regardless of their actual value,” how are you determining value?",that’s hard.
2009,2009_148.txt,0,0.9273813366889954,does home size play into this at all?,home size does play into it.
2009,2009_149.txt,0,0.5551761984825134,what do you mean by means?,"well money, insight, help, family members, etcetera."
2009,2009_149.txt,0,0.34266769886016846,ok,"and that’s ok if they go in and out and use it as a workroom, but if it’s got stuff in it and they never walk into it then that’s an indication."
2009,2009_149.txt,0,0.5631279349327087,"could this be a similar, but more extreme difference?",not sure i follow that question.
2009,2009_150.txt,0,0.3297930359840393,"so one of the ideas behind talking about clutter is that the space is filled and that’s a problem, but are their people for whom they don’t need to have as much free space in their home in order to live with a sense of ease or comfort?",oh sure.
2009,2009_150.txt,0,0.5188348293304443,is that kind of a cultural intended use or is that this individual’s intended use?,"i think it’s kind of both, right?"
2009,2009_151.txt,0,0.633916437625885,how do you go about determining how much distress is normal or abnormal?,"well i think that distress in discarding in general is abnormal, right, in that we may feel a little twinge of sorrow when we get rid of something that has sentimental value, but we’ve decided it’s time to go."
2009,2009_151.txt,0,0.5510602593421936,and is it sometimes difficult to assess the level of distress that hoarders have?,"yeah, there’s no real objective way to assess an internal feeling, right?"
2009,2009_151.txt,0,0.5225903391838074,what about if a patient is denying having a problem?,so that’s true for all disorders that have variable insight.
2009,2009_152.txt,0,0.4425671398639679,"are these explanations, in your opinion, post hoc reasons to justify pathological need?",i don’t know.
2009,2009_152.txt,0,0.5928833484649658,“what do you think has caused you to have these beliefs?”,"behaviors, it would have to be for this, not beliefs."
2009,2009_152.txt,0,0.6010289192199707,"beliefs, behaviors, yeah.",or difficulties.
2009,2009_152.txt,0,0.5460023880004883,"“do these beliefs or behaviors have a psychiatric or psychological, neurological cause, or are they true?”",true?
2009,2009_153.txt,0,0.5984535217285156,are they actually true?,"so “true” is not going to work for hoarding either because it’s not a “true,” right?"
2009,2009_153.txt,0,0.7073742747306824,how do you define insight?,insight is the awareness of what your symptoms are and how they impact you and the world around you.
2009,2009_153.txt,0,0.44928860664367676,“how convinced are you of these ideas or beliefs about the value of things and the impact it has on your life?”,ok that’s going to have to be reworded also.
2009,2009_153.txt,0,0.4416140019893646,so you think that that low insight subgroup is –,not going to come in for treatment.
2009,2009_153.txt,0,0.6051246523857117,would you say that it’s… that you think prevalence wise or population wise it would probably be a 50/50 split?,"no, i think it’s a spectrum like this."
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.4357112944126129,in your experience are any of these more prevalent or more problematic in your work with these individuals?,"probably anosognosia and, to a lesser degree, not overvalued ideation but overvalued beliefs that these are going to be needed in the future, somebody is going to need these in the future."
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.7031300663948059,and defensiveness.,"defensiveness is a secondary phenomenon, i think, around, for people who have insight, a need to, well, defend their symptoms and behaviors, but i think it’s tied to insight."
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.7003087997436523,"so, you cannot have defensiveness without insight?",without a modicum of insight at least.
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.6740675568580627,do you feel like it’s normally self-motivated or by others?,"in my experience it’s been both, most of the people who come and stick in treatment it’s self-motivated."
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.48954424262046814,how long has the hoarding behavior been going on before you typically see patients?,at the very least a decade and usually much longer.
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.5807119011878967,"how aware, would you say, are typical patients that they have hoarding disorder when you first see them?","well, because they’re in my clinic or in my research study, pretty aware."
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.6754972338676453,pretty aware.,yeah.
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.45482760667800903,"so, next i’m going to ask you, how do you explain hoarding disorder to a patient with low insight?","i think that has changed over the years as my understanding of it has changed, but i explain that things are valuable to them, that even though they’re valuable there is some risk in keeping as many things as they have."
2009,2009_154.txt,0,0.4538092613220215,ok.,and that’s changed over the years as i’ve kind of worked with folks more and more.
2009,2009_155.txt,0,0.4033292531967163,is that something that you try to do?,i think for those that are amenable to it a medical model can help.
2009,2009_155.txt,0,0.37628915905952454,yeah.,"to me insight is, despite kind of a recognized, societally recognized understanding of something, your view of it is different and limited, and i don’t think we’re there for hoarding disorder."
2009,2009_155.txt,0,0.3458386957645416,"so, what do you think causes a patient to fail to gain insight?",i think it’s biology actually.
2009,2009_155.txt,0,0.5305588245391846,how much do you feel like insight or the lack thereof impinges on an individual’s quality of life?,i think it can impinge on it quite directly.
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.63723224401474,"so, you feel like, we psychiatry, medicine is not in a place where we can directly treat insight, lack of insight.","no, i think we can chip away at it, but i don’t think we can directly treat it."
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.313277930021286,yeah.,"we try with anorexia to kind of pound insight into folks, but i don’t think it’s successful."
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.38215768337249756,can you speculate as to what goes into that shift to insight?,for anorexia?
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.4645146131515503,"for anorexia, what it would look like in INDISTINGUISHABLE",i wish.
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.4052678644657135,and have you seen that variance in insight in individuals with hoarding disorder?,mhm.
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.3315637707710266,what have you seen?,"i think there’s two kinds of trajectories, one is over time with treatment, somebody who engages in treatment, their insight can shift for the better."
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.4605376124382019,yeah.,kind of those breakthrough moments people talk about one way or the other.
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.45799657702445984,kind of the last set of questions i wanted to ask you were: what role do a patient’s family and friends play in arriving at a diagnosis of hoarding disorder?,"well if you can get collateral information it’s always very useful because patients can over and under report their symptoms, typically under report but also over report."
2009,2009_156.txt,0,0.6326548457145691,what relatives do you find are most often involved in that process?,"it’s not necessarily relatives, it’s somebody living with the person, so living partners usually."
2009,2009_157.txt,0,0.4908641576766968,"ok. and do you… what’s the relationship between patients’ family, friends, loved ones living with them and their degree of insight?",i don’t know that there is a direct relationship.
2009,2009_157.txt,0,0.28752952814102173,"how often or how frequently are employees of the state, you know, social workers, police officers, homeowner’s associations, involved in cases of hoarding disorder and people coming in and diagnosing?","so, the two different questions."
2009,2009_157.txt,0,0.7208316326141357,well alright that is all the questions i have for you.,they’re good questions.
2010,2010_158.txt,0,0.6827628016471863,hello?,hey its NAME.
2010,2010_158.txt,0,0.8237992525100708,can you hear us?,i can hear you.
2010,2010_158.txt,0,0.6497390866279602,"ok, NAME.",yes?
2010,2010_158.txt,0,0.3426426649093628,"so, if some of the questions that we ask today sound a little bit odd, you know, just thinking about them as being framed in terms of comparing it to what a patient with hoarding disorder might say might clarify for you why we’re asking the particular things that we’re asking.",sure
2010,2010_158.txt,0,0.5231508016586304,"so, if it’s ok with you i can just…",i am in the car.
2010,2010_158.txt,0,0.8911406397819519,ok?,ok.
2010,2010_158.txt,0,0.6385248899459839,"yeah that sounds clearer, thank you for that.",sure!
2010,2010_158.txt,0,0.5399123430252075,"i can answer any questions that you have at any point during our conversation, so just going to read you what we have for our informed consent.",ok.
2010,2010_159.txt,0,0.6351408362388611,do you have any questions or would you like to continue with the interview?,"i have no questions, and i am consenting to continue."

2010,2010_160.txt,0,0.6150274872779846,what is your training and educational background?,"so, my undergraduate is psychology from INSTITUTION, and then i did my master’s and my phd in clinical psych at INSTITUTION."
2010,2010_160.txt,0,0.4486800730228424,"ok, and do you now see patient’s clinically with hoarding disorder?","yes, yeah."
2010,2010_160.txt,0,0.6243728399276733,"mhm, and do you also conduct research or is your role mostly clinical?","no, it’s all clinical."
2010,2010_160.txt,0,0.35522887110710144,"and, you said how long has it been since you started working in hoarding disorder?",2006.
2010,2010_160.txt,0,0.4264475405216217,"so, the first question that we have for you in this section now is, “what for you are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, like collecting for example, and hoarding disorder?”",i think it’s the… i’m trying to… i would put it where there is the detachment of importance to the item.
2010,2010_160.txt,0,0.6105111837387085,"more intense and more, i guess, dispersed.","yeah, so a broader blanket, and more intense emotions and a greater value attached."
2010,2010_161.txt,0,0.6667743921279907,"and, can you tell us, you know, what are the demographics of the typical patient with hoarding disorder?","well, demographics of the clients that i see?"
2010,2010_161.txt,0,0.5786295533180237,"yeah, the clients that you see or if you think that there is a difference between the clientele that you see and the typical individual with hoarding disorder in the country, maybe speaking to that as well.","right, well i think with who i see, it’s generally female, and with my client base its mostly caucasian, but i know that that’s not representative."
2010,2010_161.txt,0,0.40913426876068115,"ok, and do you feel like any of those demographics that you described are translatable to the hoarding population at large?","i feel like the age definitely is, and i just feel like in general women are more likely to seek out mental health services than men are."
2010,2010_161.txt,0,0.4337846636772156,"and, do you have any idea why the age has been coming down, that you’ve noticed in the individuals that you see?",well i think that there’s a growing awareness about the fact that there are services available.
2010,2010_161.txt,0,0.42189887166023254,"and can you think of a specific case or cases that were challenging to diagnose because they were on the border between pathological and non-pathological, maybe subclinical, and kind of talk about how you made that distinction?",i’m trying to think of someone in particular.
2010,2010_161.txt,0,0.803337812423706,"ok, ok.",yeah.
2010,2010_162.txt,0,0.26637518405914307,"similarly, trying to clean and bring your space under order and not being able to do so as an indicator that there may be a pathological problem.","yeah, definitely."
2010,2010_162.txt,0,0.5864288210868835,"do you feel like, first of all, that there are particular elements of these criteria that might be particularly difficult or ambiguous, or that some clinicians might see differently than others, or do you feel like there’s anything in them that might have to do with the language or might be a matter of clinical judgement more than others?",one part that gets… and i notice it’s kind of the language with most of the diagnoses in the dsm is kind of the rule out.
2010,2010_162.txt,0,0.5053693056106567,"and, how do you make that clinical judgement, how do you make that call?",i go more based on what the level of accumulation in the house and how is it interfering... how is the clutter specifically interfering with the daily functioning?
2010,2010_162.txt,0,0.3173278868198395,"so, you look at the space and the way that the space is impacting their life.",yes.
2010,2010_162.txt,0,0.55513995885849,"or, maybe not just anxiety, but other co-occurring mental health disorders.",i feel like it’s much more with the depression.
2010,2010_163.txt,0,0.44011518359184265,and is that because the behavior of depression might cause someone to accumulate things or be unable to clean INAUDIBLE?,"yeah, i think just the behavioral activation INAUDIBLE."
2010,2010_163.txt,0,0.648057758808136,what makes the value judgement for a person with hoarding disorder inappropriate?,"i think it’s more… i mean one of the challenges i feel here is when i ask somebody, and this is like a fire marshal, “how do you know if it’s a hoarding disorder situation?” he’s like, “well it’s like porn, you know it when you see it.”"
2010,2010_163.txt,0,0.4463045299053192,"so, it sounds like you make the determination less about each item and more about the pattern of items.",yeah.
2010,2010_164.txt,0,0.4142513871192932,"and, does it matter which culture the patient is from or what their beliefs about items might be?","i think it’s harder when it’s the emotional attachment to items or the emotional value because that really is so strongly based on an individual’s experiences, or kind of how they define their identity."
2010,2010_164.txt,0,0.534010648727417,"so, again, we’re kind of interested in this question of how you make the determination of how much stuff is too much, especially perhaps considering things like home size or other people in the home that might affect the degree of clutter that you see.","well, i think one of the big pieces is what’s the purpose of that home?"
2010,2010_165.txt,0,0.5164071917533875,do you think home size plays any role in being able to tell or how quickly you might pick up on it?,i think it does.
2010,2010_166.txt,0,0.3757898807525635,"do you kind of notice those are not for storage or is it a little more flexible than that, and how do you negotiate what counts as INAUDIBLE and what doesn’t?","well, i think… i would say, you know, kind of separate from what the normal part is, the safety risk."
2010,2010_167.txt,0,0.4277609586715698,"do you think hoarding disorder could be kind of an extension of this variance or is there… is that maybe INAUDIBLE below threshold, or is it something entirely different?",i think that it’s a combination of the two.
2010,2010_167.txt,0,0.36895689368247986,ok.,"yeah, so my husband doesn’t care about his files, he just doesn’t want to deal with them, but if he needs to sit down and do it he has the ability to do it."
2010,2010_167.txt,0,0.6974226236343384,"so, again we were kind of wondering how you assess the degree of distress that somebody has with discarding an item, and whether this might be more difficult to assess in patients who don’t have a lot of insight about the disorder.","yeah, i think that if the individuals don’t have the insight, or they’re also far enough removed from their stuff, they may think that they wouldn’t have any difficulty letting go of the items, but then when they’re actually in the moment of dealing with the items, that’s when the distress comes up."
2010,2010_167.txt,0,0.33832529187202454,"so, you might ask a patient in your office, “would you get rid of this item?” and they would say, “yes,” but then when actually confronted with the need to do it they would experience distress.",right.
2010,2010_167.txt,0,0.5492575168609619,"but, they wouldn’t… they didn’t even know they would experience it.",or they would significantly underestimate the level of distress that they would expect to have.
2010,2010_167.txt,0,0.5567908883094788,"i appreciate you… your answers are great so we’re kind of taking our time, assuming you have time, but if you need to end at any point just let us know.","ok, sure."
2010,2010_168.txt,0,0.5220245122909546,"so, can you tell us how you define insight?","i think it comes from, how did they explain the situation to me?"
2010,2010_168.txt,0,0.32488974928855896,"what do you mean, externalizing?","putting responsibility of the situation… they didn’t have the resources that they needed to be able to effectively organize the situation, the landlord was being unreasonable about how the space needed to be maintained, it really wasn’t problematic."
2010,2010_168.txt,0,0.4754544198513031,"and, so do you have any knowledge about how patients successfully gain insight, or how you might help a patient try to gain insight?",i think that a big part is in as nonjudgmental a way as possible kind of trying to point out kind of how are things connected.
2010,2010_169.txt,0,0.5482339859008789,"and, do you think that when patients kind of come to you with that insight already that that is something that they’ve come to on their own or do you think that its often their families that assisted in the process?","i think it’s often either the family, but i feel like there’s been some kind of external event that’s been sort of almost like a wakeup call."
2010,2010_169.txt,0,0.798073947429657,"ok, so when they get some outside input.",i think there’s been some outside input.
2010,2010_169.txt,0,0.26495125889778137,"yeah, and things can also, i assume, become dangerous when individuals with hoarding disorder start to isolate, because then they don’t have that…","that outside calibration, yeah."
2010,2010_169.txt,0,0.5044816732406616,"so, those constructs are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness and the distress, the idea of overvalued ideation, unreasonable belief in the value of the items, and indifference.","i think i’m more likely to see the indifference, and i don’t know if that’s more of the reaction of, “i’ve been dealing with this so ling i’ve kind of stopped caring about it or how it might be having an impact on other people,” or almost like a withdrawal from the situation, almost like a learned helplessness or hopelessness tied into it."
2010,2010_169.txt,0,0.43297016620635986,"i think that falls into some kind of borderline category between indifferent and maybe overvalued ideation, not realizing what a big difference it would make.",well and then also not prioritizing the actions that are tied into the decluttering.
2010,2010_170.txt,0,0.3732353150844574,that makes sense.,"and, i think that the defensiveness, i think that depends on how you’re interacting with them."
2010,2010_170.txt,0,0.4103323221206665,"so, they’re feeling like the need to justify themselves right off the bat INUADIBLE.",right.
2010,2010_170.txt,0,0.4101005494594574,"and, the first thing we’d like you to do is just kind of think through some of the questions from an adapted version of the brown assessment of beliefs scale and we’d like you to just think about your patients and try to think about what, in your experience, your patients would say in response to these questions from the brown assessment of beliefs.",ok.
2010,2010_170.txt,0,0.41851305961608887,"and so, for example, one of the questions is, “what do you think has cause you to have these behaviors and do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?” so, just from your time spent treating patients, what do you think your patients believe is causing their behaviors?","hm, i’m thinking of a couple clients in particular where there’s a feeling that they need to either be able to control or compensate for a particular situation."
2010,2010_170.txt,0,0.23295143246650696,"so, maybe it starts out with more of a, kind of, experiential cause and then over time as they begin to build insight they begin to realize that it’s more of a psychiatric cause.","right, right."
2010,2010_171.txt,0,0.5754169821739197,“how convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding?”,"i think a lot of them would say, like percentage wise maybe 60% convinced, and depending on how they would define something bad."
2010,2010_171.txt,0,0.5785735249519348,"so, less something would happen to them and more they would experience it negatively.","right, it would more just be the emotional experience rather than “if i didn’t have this my family would disown me,” or some external consequence."
2010,2010_171.txt,0,0.41170042753219604,"so, you know, reasons that people give for hoarding, are they post hoc justifications versus actual reasons, and how do you go through that idea?","i’d say, you know, kind of similar to the way you think about an ocd, an obsessive thought with a related compulsion."
2010,2010_172.txt,0,0.3200911581516266,"so, it is a disorder of the way that people think about things versus their thoughts are just kind of covering up a biological need of some kind?",that’s a really interesting question.
2010,2010_172.txt,0,0.3591078519821167,INAUDIBLE,"um, i think for some people, yes, but i feel like there’s going to be some individuals where it really it is really much more of a learned and modeled behavior than something that is kind of biologically almost pre-programmed."
2010,2010_172.txt,0,0.3217546343803406,"and do you think… right, right so some of them perhaps it’s more of a learned behavior or something that they’ve done to cope with an event, whereas other people perhaps it’s more of an urge that then gets justified.",right.
2010,2010_172.txt,0,0.506754457950592,"and, do you think that cultural forces perhaps associated with value and self-worth and consumption and ownership of material possessions play any role in the development of hoarding disorder?","this i’m not sure of, because with the talk i did earlier today one of the questions – this was for professional organizers – they had the question about shopping addiction."
2010,2010_172.txt,0,0.30068567395210266,ok.,"i think one of the statistics was like 60 or 70% of american women identify as being, you know, shopping addicts."
2010,2010_173.txt,0,0.7641966342926025,"people might perceive it as obsessive, but that shopping addiction or that, you know, excessive accumulation of items through hoarding, that’s kind of separate from that but perhaps related as well.","i think so, and then also looking at the excessive acquisition from the hoarding side of things, that is not actual shopping."
2010,2010_173.txt,0,0.3294469714164734,"mhm, great.",and how is… and does that serve the same emotional purpose of shopping addiction or is it functionally different?
2010,2010_173.txt,0,0.5946369171142578,this is our kind of last group of questions for you.,ok.
2010,2010_173.txt,0,0.678516149520874,"so, do you feel like people presenting for treatment are normally self-motivated or more often by others?","i think it’s more often by others, at least for maybe the initial appointment and then it transitions over to them more wanting to do it for themselves."
2010,2010_173.txt,0,0.4871183931827545,yeah.,it’s more constructive for them.
2010,2010_173.txt,0,0.40074649453163147,"ok, and how long has the hoarding behavior typically been going on before you’ll see patients?",decades.
2010,2010_174.txt,0,0.42942145466804504,"and, do you ever get patients who are in earlier stages of hoarding disorder or have been hoarding for less long?","well i did have… in my current group, there are two clients who are younger than i am."
2010,2010_174.txt,0,0.7550395131111145,"just wondering if in the course of your, kind of, practice you had developed kind of a sense of the life course of hoarding disorder, like when it typically begins or if that seems to differ from patient to patient.","i definitely see it beginning, i would say by early twenties, and it’s not necessarily in the threshold for it to be a diagnosis of hoarding disorder, but the patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are contributing to the accumulation."
2010,2010_174.txt,0,0.5980984568595886,"and so, that’s pretty consistent that it starts that early?","i think so, yeah."
2010,2010_174.txt,0,0.2719191908836365,INAUDIBLE,"yeah, but it’s more… some of it is when did they have the space and the opportunity to acquire, or when did they maybe get upset with their parents for discarding things?"
2010,2010_174.txt,0,0.39283642172813416,"and so, i know that we discussed this a little as well in terms of the role that patients’ family and friends play in arriving at the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, and so are there relatives that are more often involved in this process?",i feel like it ends up being siblings.
2010,2010_175.txt,0,0.6067326068878174,do you feel like you see a fair amount of that?,not so much.
2010,2010_175.txt,0,0.4646960198879242,"or, do think that they perceive that it’s not the kind of place that hoarding disorder occurs?","i think that there is a growing awareness of it, but maybe there…."
2010,2010_175.txt,0,0.6972607374191284,ok.,i’m not sure.
2010,2010_175.txt,0,0.5580454468727112,it’s been a really great interview and it’s been a pleasure learning from you so we really appreciate you taking the time to go through really in detail with us.,happy to do it!
2010,2010_175.txt,0,0.46156224608421326,"your experiences are really interesting, so the final kind of question that we have for you to close out our interview is to have you go through what you think the biggest things we still don’t know about hoarding disorder are or the unanswered questions in your mind for the future.",hm.
2010,2010_175.txt,0,0.3102151155471802,"that’s interesting, yeah.","yeah, i think one of challenges, because there is the assumption, the faulty assumption that people who struggle with hoarding don’t want to get better, are treatment resistant."
2010,2010_176.txt,0,0.53882896900177,let me know if anybody comes to mind.,"well i think, i mean the email that NAME sent out, it kind of covered everybody."
2010,2010_176.txt,0,0.6493880748748779,"right, that’s why we’re kind of asking to make sure that we’re just comprehensive.","yeah, i think that it’s pretty comprehensive."
2010,2010_176.txt,0,0.7217654585838318,good point.,yeah.
2010,2010_177.txt,0,0.5775947570800781,"and, we really appreciate you being part of it, again.","oh, happy to, it sounds really cool."

2011,2011_178.txt,0,0.7129694223403931,does that all sound okay with you?,sure.
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.7665525674819946,is that all okay with you?,"yeah, that’s fine."
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.6087716221809387,"right, ok so they might come in because they’re personally distressed by their behavior because they’re encouraged by their friends or relatives or because there’s a local agency that’s intervened in their lives somehow and are forcing them to deal with their…","well the agency can’t force them to do anything, but the agency can force them to clean up or may go in and clean up their yard and send them a bill, and then the patient might be personally distressed and because of that experience it may contribute to them coming in."
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.47857868671417236,"those are the lists that we have for you today and to kind of move into the interview, i’d just like to start by asking you to describe for me a little bit of your background relating to hoarding disorder, your training, and your current either research or practice.",so i’m a psychiatrist.
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.49108678102493286,are you currently seeing patients with hoarding disorder clinically?,a few.
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.6162794828414917,how would you distinguish hoarding disorder from normal saving behavior?,"that the person is unable to discard unimportant items or items that otherwise lack value and because of the that, the living spaces become unusable."
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.327925443649292,ok.,"or they become cluttered and in the worse cases, they’re not usable."
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.8595484495162964,i mean can one be a hoarder if one kept valuable items instead of worthless items?,so you’re asking if someone can hoard things that do have value?
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.7542617917060852,right.,"yes, absolutely."
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.5847325325012207,and can you think of a case or…,i don’t recall having a patient like that.
2011,2011_179.txt,0,0.5280925631523132,"is that, would that be correct?",when i see them or the patient sees them?
2011,2011_180.txt,0,0.3435388207435608,i mean…,"the patient, the patient sees everything as having some value to them, whether it’s monetary, or sentimental, or other."
2011,2011_180.txt,0,0.533280611038208,i don’t know if that question makes sense.,that can be part of it.
2011,2011_180.txt,0,0.5164497494697571,"when you think about the patients that you’ve seen with hoarding disorder, can you think of a specific case or cases that were perhaps challenging to diagnose either clinically or in research because it was on the border between pathological and non-pathological behavior?","i can think of one case where a man collected books and his wife was quite distressed by it and the way she described it, he sounded like a hoarder."
2011,2011_180.txt,0,0.4492286443710327,and that was because…,"but that was, that was an example of where it was hard to draw the line."

2011,2011_180.txt,0,0.5675920248031616,so it wasn’t indiscriminate?,no.
2011,2011_180.txt,0,0.5205003023147583,are there any particular elements of the dsm five criteria that you regard as particularly difficult to apply or that you think that different clinicians may apply differently due to things like the language or clinical judgement?,"well, let me look up the criteria."

2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.33159175515174866,go ahead.,"so, uh, well let’s see so…i guess that allows me to also diagnose obsessive compulsive disorder but i think that quite a, a good, a fairly high percentage of ocd patients have some hoarding but it may not rise to the level of hoarding disorder."
2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.542425274848938,do you find that that is uh…,"no, i mean, that is self-evident if it’s present."
2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.793620228767395,is that correct?,yeah that’s correct.
2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.6336238384246826,how do you make the decision as to which diagnosis is kind of predominant or primarily…,"well, to me, if they meet criteria for both independently, i’ll give them both diagnoses."
2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.525650680065155,ok.,"if it’s just some minor hoarding, i’ll chalk that up to ocd."
2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.360348641872406,i’d like to return to the part of the dsm five that talks about congesting and cluttering active living areas and compromising intended use of the person’s space.,yeah ok.
2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.27883005142211914,so do you ever take that into account or how does that affect?,"that doesn’t seem to be a problem with the diagnosis because if people have tiny homes and they’re otherwise neat and tidy, you know, the behavior of hoarders is so distinctive that it’s hard to confuse that with someone who simply doesn’t have a lot of space available."
2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.4334849715232849,so you think that…,"so now, now i’m not seeing this but i ask patients, you know, would i be horrified if i saw your home?"
2011,2011_181.txt,0,0.35140907764434814,mm-hmm.,"and patients are usually uh, at least my long-term patients are usually fairly honest with me in describing what i would see."
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.4480416476726532,so you feel like…,"you have to, you have to ask a series of detailed, aggressively more detailed questions in order to get at it sometimes, but…"
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.5294384360313416,"so i guess that’s another, the question is does it seem to be a problem where people don’t see the clutter in the same way that someone who does not have hoarding disorder?","well, some of them don’t, some of them don’t seem to have a whole lot insight and maybe the spouse is the main complainer, is the person reporting and complaining about it."
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.4207112789154053,or how would you describe…,"the patient is, says “i’m a hoarder."
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.8973260521888733,"and it sounds like in your practice, most of the patients you see have fairly high levels of insight when you see them.",most of my patients have good insight.
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.3572024405002594,have you ever seen patients who have come in with very low insight?,yes.
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.3640959858894348,"and when you see those patients, do you have a process for helping patients try to gain insight or…","i don’t think you can, i don’t think you can."
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.6477434635162354,"and do you have a sense for the patients that you see how they acquired insight, if they always had insight into their problem or if something happened to help them?","well, the ones i am thinking of always had insight and over…i am thinking of one patient in particular whose hoarding has progressively gotten worse as she’s gotten older."
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.7871212363243103,and you feel like she’s just always been aware that it’s been a problem.,she’s always been aware.
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.46027058362960815,ok.,but she feels powerless to do anything about it.
2011,2011_182.txt,0,0.6427246928215027,"so it’s not a problem of her not knowing that, it’s an issue of…","no, no. she knows."
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.5222744941711426,"and so being defensive, might be someone who just doesn’t want to deal with the problem versus someone who has anosognosia who really doesn’t see that they have an illness.","i mean you see all of these things to varying degrees in most of the patients, but…i don’t actively think about those things when evaluating or treating a patient."
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.5113503336906433,ok.,"i’m not sure, i’m not sure if it would help me one way or another."
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.4007149040699005,ok.,"if the patient has no insight, i’m not gonna, i’m not gonna be able to give them insight."
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.6141100525856018,do feel like patients have a sense of what has caused them to be this way or is there…,"so what you’re asking, what they tell me is the cause?"
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.6971830725669861,yes.,"um, i’m not sure."
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.36966365575790405,"so a patient might say “i’m saving this, you know, item because it has sentimental value or because i might need it later,” do you feel like these reasons…","yeah, they typically, they say those things."
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.7239665389060974,"do you think that those are real, real reasons or do you think that they’re kind of post-hoc justifications for an underlying need?",i would think that they’re justifications.
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.4465521275997162,so you think…,every patient justifies their illness.
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.6494525074958801,so you think that the behavior comes first and then the rationale behind the need…,and then the rationale.
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.4878759980201721,do you have a sense for how long the hoarding behavior has typically been going on before you see patients?,"well, it depends on how old they are."
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.556641697883606,so…,many years or decades.
2011,2011_183.txt,0,0.5498858094215393,"so do you have a sense for when in people’s lives it tends to begin, so in childhood…?",probably by their twenties.
2011,2011_184.txt,0,0.6181357502937317,"and, so how long has it…how has the illness progressed over time, how has it come to…?","over time, it seems to get worse."
2011,2011_184.txt,0,0.39800330996513367,"and then as they age, do you feel like the illness worsens or do you feel like, um, for instance social factors like the isolation of children leaving home or spouses dying or…","well those things have an influence because if the kid’s living at home, the mother might force them to clean up their room so when he leaves to live on his own, he can do what he wants because mom isn’t there to force him to clean up."
2011,2011_184.txt,0,0.6090819835662842,"we’re kind of trying to get at whether that is because it is a progressive illness that worsens as people age or whether that’s a result of, you know, possessions accumulating over time, perhaps changes in levels of their social support as they get older…","i think, i think all of the things contribute because a) they might not have a spouse to keep the hoarding in check, b) they’re older, so they’ve accumulated stuff over a lifetime so they probably have more stuff or they have a large house and the kids are out of the home so there’s more space to accumulate stuff."
2011,2011_184.txt,0,0.33878886699676514,"and when you look at the current state of research on hoarding disorder, what for you are the biggest unanswered questions about this disorder?",could you repeat that?
2011,2011_184.txt,0,0.5836235880851746,"oh no. i said, as you kind of look over the current state of research regarding hoarding disorder, what are, for you, the biggest unanswered questions or the biggest things that we still don’t know about this disorder?","well, there are a number of things we don’t know."
2011,2011_184.txt,0,0.41538292169570923,and for you…,so there’s this unaddressed need to develop effective treatments.
2011,2011_185.txt,0,0.4130043685436249,"i guess, you know, in laymen’s terms why do you think that it doesn’t work, why do you think that it doesn’t work very well?","because every single hoarder patient that i’ve had has been referred for cbt and usually experts in ocd who understand hoarding and they’ve been trained in some of these models and the patient won’t persist, the patient won’t; it’s not that the treatment itself doesn’t offer something, it’s that the patient won’t do what the therapist tells them to do or they won’t persist at it."
2011,2011_185.txt,0,0.6288906931877136,"umm, for you, where would you see hoarding on kind of like the spectrum between those differences?",well my idea was that hoarding should not have been designated as an independent disorder.
2011,2011_185.txt,0,0.4453654885292053,so do you…,"it’s not a preponderant problem, but they have some tendency."
2011,2011_185.txt,0,0.5215659737586975,and do you see this kind of a pleasure component with acquiring with your hoarding patients or do you kind of find that to be…,"no, no because most patients say “you know, i really don’t like this, it’s upsetting” so, you know, we try to take the item away from them, we try to get them to throw it away."
2011,2011_185.txt,0,0.37725067138671875,"ok, well i really appreciate your time…","now, now there is a subgroup of people who hoard who might be said to have compulsive shopping, i’ve read quite a bit about that."
2011,2011_185.txt,0,0.3502129018306732,"and um, it sounds like in terms of your understanding of hoarding disorder, it’s a combination of either a genetic predisposition or behavioral modeling.",i think so.
2011,2011_186.txt,0,0.7279538512229919,do you give any kind of credence to the idea that being the response to trauma or as some patients might say the need to save because of poverty or anything like that?,"the trauma explanation, no. the other explanation, i…that you mentioned saving because they grew up poor or something, to me that’s environmental, so there’s always an environmental component to that."
2011,2011_186.txt,0,0.5437053442001343,have you ever encountered a child who you would characterize as a hoarder or a person under the age of eighteen?,i can’t think of any but i’m not a child psychiatrist.
2011,2011_186.txt,0,0.5270806550979614,do you have any questions for me about what we’re doing or anything i can answer?,"no, not at all."
2011,2011_186.txt,0,0.5630401968955994,i really appreciate your patience; i apologize for uh…,ok.
2011,2011_186.txt,0,0.6742271780967712,thank you very much.,ok.
2012,2012_187.txt,0,0.34525784850120544,"so, we are getting people to refer us to other people who they think are key experts so that’s how we got your name.",okay
2012,2012_187.txt,0,0.2964812219142914,"we are interested in exploring questions like insight in hording disorders, so how patients come to understand that they have a disorder.",sure.
2012,2012_187.txt,0,0.2824627459049225,and if that can be useful in helping patients come to treatment earlier and dealing with the problem in sight.,okay.
2012,2012_187.txt,0,0.5985177755355835,so that’s the idea behind our project.,sounds interesting.
2012,2012_187.txt,0,0.5833238363265991,i don’t know if you have any questions for me right of the bat.,"no, i don’t think so."
2012,2012_187.txt,0,0.6039387583732605,so that’s what we are going to be doing today.,okay.
2012,2012_187.txt,0,0.5807561278343201,stop me if i am going to fast or if you have any questions.,"no, you are fine."
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.46492382884025574,i will go ahead and read you the informed consent and you can let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything that i can clarify.,sounds cool.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.5233398675918579,"so, i will just go through the informed consent really fast and let me know.",okay.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.47991275787353516,"so, you are volunteering to participate in a research project conducted by carl mathews from the university of florida.",yep.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.42061474919319153,INAUDIBLE most interviewees find the discussion interesting and thought provoking but if you feel uncomfortable in any way during the interview session you have the right to decline to answer any questions or to end the interview.,okay.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.38872361183166504,"we will also not identify you by name in any reports, your confidentiality as a participant will remain secure, and obviously subsequent use of records of data will be subject to standard data use policies, which protect the anonymity of individuals and institutions.",okay.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.8960766196250916,okay?,okay.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.6925159096717834,all sound good?,yep.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.6336914300918579,any questions?,nope.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.42257261276245117,"so just to begin, if you wouldn’t mind briefly telling me your background related to hoarding disorder and how you are involved in either research or patient care.",sure.
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.662604033946991,"hello, did i lose you?",INAUDIBLE
2012,2012_188.txt,0,0.7145872116088867,hello.,"yes, can you hear me now?"
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.5869583487510681,"yes, i can hear you now, sorry about that.","okay, that’s weird."
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.5305414199829102,"yeah, i don’t know what that was.",all good?
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.5006273984909058,"so, you oversee the clinic, sorry.",i oversee that hoarding treatment protocol and provide patient treatment for hoarding disorder.
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.4713583290576935,is that correct?,i don’t see very many patients clinically.
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.6451044678688049,hello?,yeah.
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.557957112789154,i can try calling you back if that would be helpful?,i don’t know.
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.5521427989006042,you want me to try giving you a call back?,if it happens again let’s try another connection.
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.47567737102508545,that’s good.,so why don’t we stay CUTS_OUT difficult connection...
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.5596223473548889,"yep, there it goes.","there he is, do you want to try hanging up and calling me back."
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.999997615814209,okay.,okay.
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.6800534725189209,i am so sorry about that.,"no, no problem at all."
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.4914127588272095,what is your educational background?,yeah.
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.7339937090873718,and how long have you been working with patients with hoarding disorder?,"i think i have been dealing with hoarding disorder since probably, maybe 2003/2002, something like that."
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.3738973140716553,we are going to move into the part of the interview where we talk about the things that set hoarding disorder apart as a disorder from normal kinds of behaviors.,okay.
2012,2012_189.txt,0,0.5044357776641846,"so, for you when you think about hoarding disorder what are some of the most important differences between normal saving behavior such as perhaps collecting and hoarding disorder?",well i think that probably the main one that distinguishes any pathology from its normative behavioral cousin is the degree of dysfunction that it entails.
2012,2012_190.txt,0,0.46295490860939026,or is there a different way you would define impairment?,that inability to do basic things in the home as well as the ability to live safety in the home.
2012,2012_190.txt,0,0.41891878843307495,"so, it’s very kind of concretely linked to the home itself and their ability to exist in their home environment.","yes, i think that’s a big piece of it."
2012,2012_190.txt,0,0.2445535659790039,does that sound right?,"right, and they don’t derive much of a sense of pleasure from their items."
2012,2012_190.txt,0,0.40473124384880066,"okay, so your sense is that a person with this disorder doesn’t get as much satisfaction out of their behavior as a collector.","no, i don’t think so."
2012,2012_190.txt,0,0.49114084243774414,"that’s interesting, so it seems like in your mind this disorder then is much more linked to kind of obsessive compulsive spectrum where you are anxious about giving it up and maybe less related to something like compulsive gambling or compulsive shopping where you are actually enjoying the activity of acquiring, or is that not correct?",well there’s sort of two different pieces to hoarding.
2012,2012_190.txt,0,0.31923285126686096,okay.,"so i think there is probably two processes that kick in and that’s why i think hoarding overlaps somewhat with the obsessive compulsive kind of disorders, but i also think it overlaps somewhat with the impulse control disorders."
2012,2012_191.txt,0,0.7142946124076843,can you think of a specific case or cases that you encountered either clinically or in research where you felt it was challenging to diagnosis someone because they were either exhibiting either unusual kinds of behaviors or they were right on that boarder line between clinical and subclinical?,"so, you are asking me if i can identify a case where it was not clear whether it was clinical or not?"
2012,2012_191.txt,0,0.37629982829093933,"i mean, can you think of a person where it was a difficult call to say whether were exhibiting a variant of normal behavior or if they truly had hoarding disorder?","yeah, sure."
2012,2012_191.txt,0,0.6034221649169922,"and when you encounter cases like that how do you make that distinction, what really makes the difference for you?",i think what really makes the difference for me is the degree of functional impairment.
2012,2012_191.txt,0,0.3066757023334503,"so, things like INAUDIBLE.","i think it makes it harder because you know with the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, not only do all these symptoms have to be present but then you also have to be able to state with some certainty that the behaviors are not the result of some other mental disorder."
2012,2012_191.txt,0,0.40831780433654785,"is that the more common problem, is which disorder is it and not is this clinical or subclinical?",i’d say those are probably tied.
2012,2012_191.txt,0,0.45162060856819153,"so now kind of continuing to think about making the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, i’d like you to talk through with me some of the dsm 5 criteria?",sure.
2012,2012_192.txt,0,0.6057941913604736,"just before we start, when you think about the dsm5 criteria for hoarding disorder are there particular elements of the criteria that you regard as particularly difficult to apply or that perhaps different clinicians may apply differently or are perhaps more reliant on something like clinical judgment.",i think probably the hardest one for me is that last one of the symptoms are not attributable to another mental disorder.
2012,2012_192.txt,0,0.5714268684387207,"so, the first one is: persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value, and so the kind of question we had about your application of this one is: how are you determining value, and how does that the value of the items that are saved play into the diagnosis of hoarding disorder?",i think it’s very difficult to determine value because it’s so subjective.
2012,2012_192.txt,0,0.6490241885185242,does that sound right?,i think so.
2012,2012_193.txt,0,0.6490805745124817,does that sound right?,yeah.
2012,2012_193.txt,0,0.3440937101840973,right.,i think the reasons people give when you push them are not necessarily the actual reasons they are doing it.
2012,2012_193.txt,0,0.36539027094841003,right and that’s a question i was actually going to ask you later is: whether you feel the explanations are kind of post doc reasons to justify an underlying pathological need or if kind of the hoarding reasoning or thought processes is what came first or if the thought process is a product of them just justifying what they are doing?,i love that question.
2012,2012_193.txt,0,0.4307854473590851,"so, for you it’s a behavior that they do and then they watch themselves doing it and then they come up with reasons why they’ve done it.","yeah, i mean, i tend to think of hoarding a little more behaviorally and neurobiologically rather than cognitively as some of my colleagues do."
2012,2012_193.txt,0,0.44615450501441956,but it sounds like you kind of got on the biological side of that.,i mean i am all for the psychological explanation but i don’t think that that necessarily means that i am conscious that there are things that i am aware of.
2012,2012_194.txt,0,0.512251079082489,so just to return for a second to the dsm5 criteria..,yeah yeah.
2012,2012_194.txt,0,0.5972034335136414,"and how do things like the size of their home, or the amount of free space they have access to, or whether other people live with the, play into a diagnosis?",it’s a really good question because when two people engage in the exact same behavior but one has a big house and one has a small house you end up with different levels of clutter.
2012,2012_194.txt,0,0.5184059739112854,right.,"and i don’t know if we have a good way around that, i don’t know if we have a good way of resolving that."
2012,2012_194.txt,0,0.3835442364215851,do they then not have hoarding disorder because they don’t have clutter?,right.
2012,2012_195.txt,0,0.5870507955551147,"likewise, i kind of wonder how you judge the intended use of space, for instance if you have a guest room that you prefer to use for storage is that compromising intended use, or if you have a desk and the surface of your desk is covered with stuff as opposed to being open for space, you know some people prefer to use their tables to store things, and so i wonder how you judge the kind of intended use part of that criteria?","yeah, the way that i do it this is just flying by the seed of my pants is just that it’s probably pretty normal to have a space or two that you dedicate to storage."
2012,2012_195.txt,0,0.3769229054450989,"so sometimes people prefer their spaces to be more cluttered, they prefer to have more items around them and sometimes hoarders…",yeah.
2012,2012_195.txt,0,0.46379128098487854,about creating the space that they want to inhabit or is the space just kind of a byproduct of their need to save?,"i think it’s a byproduct, you know again i think that an awful lot of post talk rationalization that occurs."
2012,2012_195.txt,0,0.5266826748847961,how is this distress kind of assessed by a clinician?,"its primarily based on the persons self-report, and we might ask if i challenged you to throw away a magazine, how would you feel about that and your trying to get a sense of the whether the person would say that would be awful, i would feel like my arms are being ripped off or something like that."
2012,2012_196.txt,0,0.29414045810699463,"so, kind of to lead into that, do you find that when your patients have what we would call low insight that they deny stress associated with discarding?",yeah.
2012,2012_196.txt,0,0.4191570580005646,that they aren’t even aware of how they would feel if they had to discard?,"well, let me take that back."
2012,2012_196.txt,0,0.7563241720199585,how would you define insight?,i would define insight according to three different variables.
2012,2012_196.txt,0,0.7738882303237915,"so, they may be aware that they have a problem but just not want to deal with it?",they don’t want to acknowledge it to you because they don’t want to deal with it.
2012,2012_196.txt,0,0.8714784383773804,are they mutually exclusive?,they are not mutually exclusive.
2012,2012_197.txt,0,0.41833749413490295,whereas people who are defensive…,right.
2012,2012_197.txt,0,0.3054010570049286,whereas people who are defensive or who have overvalued ideation are at some level aware of the fact that they have a problem but either don’t want to deal with the problem or continue to believe unreasonable things despite the fact that they’re…,precisely.
2012,2012_197.txt,0,0.6411406397819519,is that what you mean by that?,yeah.
2012,2012_197.txt,0,0.3777785897254944,right.,"so, the person really and truly believes in their heart of hearts that this is a very valuable thing that they’re holding."
2012,2012_197.txt,0,0.6269164681434631,"and does that tend to take the form of “delusion” where they truly believe it has monetary value, or aesthetic value, or it’s has emotional value, like what is that delusion like?","i think it can vary i think probably the one i hear most often is either it has utility or that it has monetary value like, i’m going to sell it."
2012,2012_197.txt,0,0.6901962757110596,do you feel like there is a role for indifference in thinking about insight or is that something…,"yeah, i think of indifference as being sort of on the anosognosia spectrum."
2012,2012_197.txt,0,0.4194847345352173,how do you help patients do that?,it’s different.
2012,2012_197.txt,0,0.3298895061016083,"so, that’s just kind of to help them to see, to perceive that they have a problem is really what you are getting at?",right.
2012,2012_198.txt,0,0.3575640618801117,"for instance, if somebody’s chief providence with overvalued ideation they might be aware there is a deficit but still have a delusion.","well frankly, in a case like that i’m a little bit different."
2012,2012_198.txt,0,0.40779075026512146,okay.,in which my aim is more to help you critically evaluate what you are thinking and see if it’s realistic and maybe even do some hypothesis testing.
2012,2012_198.txt,0,0.4018983244895935,"and do you see these different kinds of insight as perhaps different points along a progress, do you feel like people start out with anosognosia and move towards defensiveness or overvalued ideation or do you think that that’s not necessarily how it works?",i don’t think that’s necessarily how it works.
2012,2012_198.txt,0,0.4021264910697937,"do you have any sense of how people gain that insight outside of a clinical setting, is it through interactions with family members or do they come to it on their own somehow?",i think it’s a mixture of both.
2012,2012_198.txt,0,0.5695005059242249,"and when you think about the patients you have come in either because they have been motivated by their family or some self-motivated, how long do these patients tend to say their behavior has gone on before they come in for treatment?",well most of them say they have been engaging in this behavior since adolescents or early adulthood.
2012,2012_199.txt,0,0.4413517713546753,how does it progress or how does it change over the course of a patient’s life?,good questions.
2012,2012_199.txt,0,0.3695499300956726,"right, so there is maybe a progressive aspect but also a social aspect and as your social life changes over your life course the manifestation of your disorder might worsen.","i think so, and there’s an environmental aspect, which is just that it takes a long time for the stuff to reach a critical mass."
2012,2012_200.txt,0,0.683900773525238,"so, the first question is if we were to ask one of your patients “what do you think has caused you to have these behaviors and do they have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause, what is your sense that your patients believe is causing their hoarding disorder?",i think that my patients would believe there is a psychiatric cause.
2012,2012_200.txt,0,0.5833726525306702,"and is your sense that they believe that it’s a biological illness, that there is a biological cause for their hoarding disorder or do they have psychological explanations for it?",i think most would have more psychological than biological explanations.
2012,2012_200.txt,0,0.671826958656311,so they would say “i have this disorder because i had an experience or because i”…,because i experienced trauma in my life or something like that.
2012,2012_200.txt,0,0.5457926392555237,that’s kind of adapted from ocd.,yeah.
2012,2012_200.txt,0,0.7588079571723938,do you think that that influences hoarding disorder at all or do you think that’s just kind of a side product or not related?,i think that cultural factors may shape the way that behavior of hoarding disorder manifests.
2012,2012_200.txt,0,0.34368234872817993,"ideas that associate saving behaviors with memory, so needing items as souvenirs or jogs for memory.",yeah.
2012,2012_200.txt,0,0.7395089864730835,what do you think is the connection between memory and saving behavior in hoarding disorder?,well its funny because you know most people with hoarding disorder have intact memory.
2012,2012_200.txt,0,0.7584158778190613,"so, they have anxiety about forgetting?","i think they have anxiety about forgetting and i think, again it depends on whether you believe that those reasons are really the causes of the behavior or they are justification."
2012,2012_201.txt,0,0.5362681746482849,"and again, that’s a very big question but.",yeah.
2012,2012_201.txt,0,0.4789227247238159,okay.,literally we don’t know anything about hoarding.
2012,2012_201.txt,0,0.48286759853363037,okay those are some big questions to answer in the future.,yes.
2012,2012_201.txt,0,0.6341798305511475,that’s all the questions that i have for you today.,"sure, my pleasure."
2013,2013_202.txt,0,0.2518024146556854,"i think that for that reason the people who, we’ll get into the course of the interview, but a lot of times clinicians kind of hit a wall when you ask them about people who have low insight into their disorder because they’ve never encountered any patients who have low insight into their disorder, because if they’re seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist they already have insight into their disorder to some extent.",yeah.
2013,2013_203.txt,0,0.4317854642868042,so that was part of the reason of kind of branching out and trying to talk to people who might be seeing CUTS_OFF.,let me give you just a tad bit of background on this too–
2013,2013_203.txt,0,0.4590558111667633,sure.,"–because again whether this even fits in this is a separate issue, i think, rather an important one."
2013,2013_204.txt,0,0.46323123574256897,"sorry to interrupt, what was going on in the house?","it was just filled with cats, the water and electricity were turned off, every room was stacked to the (inaudible, ) with cat cages, it was filthy, there was clutter everywhere, the cat cages some of them had groceries in them, sometimes with the cats, sometimes (inaudible, )."
2013,2013_205.txt,0,0.5275483727455139,"and prior to that, it hadn’t been in any previous editions of the dsm at all.","oh god no. well, hoarding disorder."
2013,2013_205.txt,0,0.5431709885597229,"yeah, yeah, yeah.","so, that’s the short history."
2013,2013_205.txt,0,0.525056779384613,what does your research look like in this topic right now?,well we’re not doing anything now.
2013,2013_205.txt,0,0.6825171709060669,"so, how many cases did you end up seeing while you were working on this topic?",well again it depends on what you mean by cases.
2013,2013_205.txt,0,0.45660823583602905,"so, you kind of would see them in the course of talking to people and your job as a veterinarian.",i would see them as the course of a law enforcement investigation basically.
2013,2013_205.txt,0,0.4856962263584137,"okay, so you would be called in at that point.",yeah.
2013,2013_206.txt,0,0.4423637390136719,how do you make that distinction in your mind?,well that’s pretty much established in the research and that’s been laid out very clearly in terms of the definition that we used and looking at any of our work INAUDIBLE it is a multi-part sort of thing.
2013,2013_206.txt,0,0.45305848121643066,or is it always a really clear–,well that’s why the INAUDIBLE piece is only one piece of it.
2013,2013_207.txt,0,0.3400833010673523,"so, you’ve never encountered a case with animal hoarding where you were like not really sure if this really counts as that, there’s a lot of animals…","well, i mean again recognize that other than for purposes of conversation there’s no usefulness to the language hoarding."
2013,2013_207.txt,0,0.4866985082626343,it doesn’t matter if they’re technically a hoarder or if they’re technically not.,"there’s no advantage and in fact there’s a lot of disadvantages, sadly."
2013,2013_207.txt,0,0.45791471004486084,so the fact that there are seventy-two cats doesn’t make it a difference that you have document each separate case.,technically it does not.
2013,2013_207.txt,0,0.4702998399734497,do they just start accumulating animals again?,"the truth of INAUDIBLE, the old adage you know we always said they would have a cat on the way home from court."
2013,2013_208.txt,0,0.426099956035614,have you ever had to take animals from the same person multiple times?,absolutely.
2013,2013_208.txt,0,0.5358133316040039,do you have any idea with the people that you encounter how long it’s been going on or when it started?,"that’s sort of a INAUDIBLE question because all of our research is really from cross-sectional information at the time of the case, so we don’t have a longitudinal."
2013,2013_209.txt,0,0.43642035126686096,what would they say?,well here’s an example in a book that you can get at INAUDIBLE it was written by NAME and NAME she’s a journalist and he’s a sociologist.
2013,2013_210.txt,0,0.5645981431007385,do you have a sense for…?,i think it’s probably complex and i don’t think this necessarily has to be a one-size-fits-all explanation.
2013,2013_210.txt,0,0.554780900478363,i wonder if you could talk me through some of the explanations that people give for their behavior when they’re confronted by charges of animal neglect.,there usually isn’t an explanation.
2013,2013_211.txt,0,0.5594599843025208,"so, we’ve talked a lot about how you kind of came to work NAME and NAME about the similarities with material object hoarding and i wonder if you could talk me through some of what you perceive are the differences, or the bigger differences, between material object hoarding and animal hoarding.","well the biggest, probably the biggest difference, unless proven otherwise, is that animals provide for a two-way relationship."
2013,2013_211.txt,0,0.3788589835166931,"so, the hoarder is looking for a response from the animal?",yeah and it may well be again that we don’t fully understand the range of etiological of backgrounds.
2013,2013_211.txt,0,0.42614609003067017,have you had experience with people who have either gained insight into their problem or else been referred to you or sought treatment for this in a way that has worked for them?,"so, my colleague NAME is probably the person who has done the most with that kind of work."
2013,2013_212.txt,0,0.49320730566978455,is it a problem of rural or urban or poverty or women or men?,"everywhere, it is everywhere."
2013,2013_212.txt,0,0.43729129433631897,"so they’ll exclusively take cats, or a particular kind of cat?",absolutely.
2013,2013_212.txt,0,0.5160409808158875,or does it tend to be like difficulty saying no to any animal?,"no, no, no. i mean i’m not going to say it’s a INAUDIBLE rule, but it certainly preponderates where people do one or the other."
2013,2013_212.txt,0,0.5200557112693787,like they’re looking for a particular kind of dog that they want to acquire or a particular breed?,there are people who again and we didn’t really investigate them INAUDIBLE but there was a subset that we started to talk about with a disorder was somebody that was at one point a professional dog breeder and a particular breed they were focusing on may be the type of the dog they showed and somewhere along the line it degenerated and they ended up being a hoarder with that breed.
2013,2013_213.txt,0,0.5254406929016113,"but it sounds like with animal hoarding there’s a lot more seeking out, so that maybe is a question i should ask you.","well, i think it’s possible that situations are not entirely terrible, because with animals it’s a very different thing to care for a dog than to care for a cat."
2013,2013_213.txt,0,0.40683382749557495,they just acquire whatever they can and sometimes their limited in their acquisition?,"i don’t know if anybody actually knows, but i think my own personal opinion is people have an affiliation just like they do with pets."
2013,2013_213.txt,0,0.5335378050804138,is it more of an inability to discard?,i think both.
2013,2013_213.txt,0,0.3169468641281128,that’s interesting.,"i mean it’s also a control issue too where if you’re a caregiver and your whole sort of INAUDIBLE is centered around being perceived as a caregiver and providing care, then you can’t provide care unless you have something that needs it."
2013,2013_214.txt,0,0.26501843333244324,"so, part of it is this identity of being a person who is a caregiver so identifying oneself as kind of like a good person because they’re taking care of so many dogs and cats, it’s a personal identity.",yes.
2013,2013_214.txt,0,0.5187292695045471,do you find that when you go into the home it’s cluttered and their car is full of stuff and also they have seventy-two cats?,"well again, it depends on how one defines the term hoarding because there’s a difference between just the accumulation of stuff in my mind versus, because they just didn’t throw it out like there’s piles of trash in the kitchen and old food, unsanitary conditions, very crowded, but they never deliberately said “oh, i want to collect INAUDIBLE.”"
2013,2013_214.txt,0,0.6398996114730835,do people who hoard animals also hoard objects?,"yes, so you will see certainly when you come into some of these places and again there’s a range of things, so sometimes yes, sometimes no. sometimes what you see is tons and tons of old pet food, bags of dog food, bags of cat food, empty cans of cat food, empty cans of dog food, you know litter bags, etc. so some of it is the INAUDIBLE of having animals and i don’t know that they’re hoarding that, they just don’t throw it away and that’s just how their lives are organized."
2013,2013_214.txt,0,0.400330126285553,interesting.,there was another case where we walked into the “shelter” and there was stall after stall after stall filled with chandeliers.
2013,2013_214.txt,0,0.544208824634552,interesting.,"so, yeah you see both."
2013,2013_214.txt,0,0.4190424978733063,it sounds like with animal hoarders a lot of times they have collections.,"well, it can be all of the above is all i’m saying."
2013,2013_215.txt,0,0.5000430345535278,and there does seem to be a parallel between seeking out animals to collect and seeking out chandeliers as opposed to with object hoarding where it’s just kind of like you said an accumulation of not throwing stuff out.,even with object hoarding though i mean there are people that do the trash pickup every day.
2013,2013_215.txt,0,0.3528302311897278,"so, just because we’re seeing people with a lot of animals doesn’t mean those people are necessarily similar in the reasons they’ve acquired those animals or how they ended up becoming people who acquire a lot of animals.","yeah, we don’t know."
2013,2013_215.txt,0,0.3353741765022278,i think a lot of the reason for those questions remaining unanswered is how difficult it is to find–,bingo!
2013,2013_215.txt,0,0.553328812122345,so do people self-identify as crazy cat ladies or do they say “i’m not a crazy cat lady because…”,"well, probably not the ones who truly are hoarders."
2013,2013_216.txt,0,0.4233701825141907,"right, that she’s listening to you describe her and she’s not seeing it.","and she came up and she chatted with me and i didn’t know who she was until after the fact somebody came up to me, a law enforcement agent came up and said, “i don’t know if you know this or not, but that was so-and-so and you know this is who she is” and i was like “wow, i never would’ve known it.”"
2013,2013_216.txt,0,0.4516870677471161,"again, i know this is a generalization i’m asking for.","well, the initial work we did and i think it has held up that they INAUDIBLE."
2013,2013_216.txt,0,0.32753726840019226,wow.,and she’s been in litigation now with the NAME and the local community and she’s got the means to be a very pretentious INAUDIBLE.
2013,2013_216.txt,0,0.37729573249816895,that is so interesting.,"there’s somebody who sort of, she doesn’t challenge the INAUDIBLE type, but she challenges a few of the others."
2013,2013_216.txt,0,0.24804924428462982,"right and then there’s that kind of correlation-causation problem where it’s like are they older and living alone and relatively impoverished because they are animal hoarders because those are they people who are able to become animal hoarders it makes them impoverished, it makes them live alone?","that’s a very good point, NAME."
2013,2013_216.txt,0,0.33738571405410767,do you see this as a behavior of a depressed person who can’t really control their life and is perhaps trying to cope with depression?,"i wouldn’t be qualified to make, i’m certainly not qualified by myself to make that judgement and we really don’t have the data because nobody has done clinical diagnostics on these samples."
2013,2013_217.txt,0,0.6659308075904846,like they are caught hearing voices?,it’s a very vocal delusion is all i can say.
2013,2013_217.txt,0,0.2422758936882019,it’s like a total blindspot about this one–,i mean there was NAME and NAME and their book NAME about a woman who was a psychiatrist in new york and she was a cat hoarder and she used to make her patients work with her cats as part of their therapy and she would encourage the patient to go home and collect their own population of cats.
2014,2014_218.txt,0,0.6903173923492432,"so now i’d like to move into the more qualitative part of the interview and just to start that off if you wouldn’t mind just briefly giving me a little bit of an overview of your background related to hoarding disorder, how you encounter patients with this disorder.","i have been working with people with hoarding disorder and doing research on hoarding disorder for about twenty years, probably started in the late ‘90s actually."
2014,2014_218.txt,0,0.5636369585990906,do you see patients clinically?,yes.
2014,2014_218.txt,0,0.423892080783844,and you hold a phd in which field?,"no, md."
2014,2014_218.txt,0,0.7440828084945679,"oh, you’re an md.","yeah, i’m a psychiatrist."
2014,2014_219.txt,0,0.3831215500831604,"so just to start the discussion i’d like you to give me an overview of what you think the most important differences, the most salient differences, between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps collecting, and hoarding disorder are.","yeah, okay, so and then there’s some literature and (inaudible, ) and colleagues on that and the differential."
2014,2014_220.txt,0,0.4712560176849365,can you hoard in that way or is that a distinguishing feature?,i mean i think sometimes there are.
2014,2014_220.txt,0,0.378383070230484,"okay, so it sounds like it’s not about the type of item or even that there is a type so much as that access of different types that they might have collectibles and might have a collection in the midst of many, many other things.",yeah and the motivation.
2014,2014_220.txt,0,0.4065708518028259,do you feel like that’s a distinguishing factor?,"yeah, because usually disorganization tends to be a prominent part of the problem in most patients with hoarding disorder and you don’t necessarily see that with people who are just collecting something."
2014,2014_221.txt,0,0.6592212915420532,"so, are they ashamed of their items?",i think there’s a great deal of shame amongst people with hoarding who do have insight into their condition.
2014,2014_221.txt,0,0.47422340512275696,that part of them realizes the behavior is problematic and that’s why they kind of hide it away or is it something else?,"no, i think that’s a big part of it."
2014,2014_222.txt,0,0.7665296196937561,can you think of a specific case or cases that was challenging to diagnose because you felt like it was kind of on the border between pathological and normal behavior?,"i would say the cases that i found hard to diagnose were not so much because of the difference between normal behavior, they were more because of a question about what was the primary problem."
2014,2014_223.txt,0,0.32042649388313293,"how do you decide if a diagnosis of hoarding or a diagnosis of ocd, for example, is a primary diagnosis?",so i think that probably the one thing that’s most crucial is reason for saving.
2014,2014_224.txt,0,0.5564868450164795,are there particular elements of these criteria that you regard as particularly difficult to apply or that you have ever thought different clinicians may apply differently or have to do with clinical judgement?,"yeah, i mean i’m biased because i wrote the first chapter of the criteria in my office a few years ago and then worked on the committee with the dsm-5 that worked on these criteria ten years ago or eight years ago."
2014,2014_225.txt,0,0.5073626041412354,is that a part of this diagnostic criteria?,"no, no i don’t think so."
2014,2014_226.txt,0,0.3738744258880615,so i’m wondering how you figure that into your diagnosis.,"yeah, i think you’re exactly right that the presence of clutter and the severity of clutter is influenced by a whole bunch of things that are completely external to the person’s psychopathology and for that reason (inaudible, ) sort of hoarding special interest groups at the foundation and our little research conferences."
2014,2014_227.txt,0,0.520025372505188,or could it be intended for storage?,right.
2014,2014_227.txt,0,0.5099586248397827,"so, for example, could one hoard digital media like digital photographs, digital, you know somebody who saved movies or books on hard drives obsessively.","yes, i’ve had patients who actually filled up multiple hard drives you know with gigabytes and terabytes worth of stuff that they have downloaded."
2014,2014_227.txt,0,0.5811733603477478,i’m wondering if you feel like that sense of being surrounded by items or being enclosed is part of what’s going on in hoarding disorder.,"yeah, so that’s another kind of area of subjectivity because it has to do with how people react to or what their own emotional sense is about openness versus closedness and clutter."
2014,2014_228.txt,0,0.6171916723251343,does that make sense as a question?,"yes, and that’s an important question that a bunch of people have tried to answer."
2014,2014_229.txt,0,0.6418940424919128,like how does distress and insight...,well actually what i find is the patients who have little insight are very distressed about discarding.
2014,2014_229.txt,0,0.5382663011550903,"but often what they mean is those people are not actually distressed by their behavior at all, they’re very distressed by discarding, but they’re not distressed by their own behavior.","yup and that was a big debate and that’s where there were (inaudible, ) and i disagreed because they were kind of writing the criteria and i think even one of their own rating scales, hoarding rating scales, that kind of implies that everybody with hoarding disorder has poor insight and doesn’t want to discard."
2014,2014_229.txt,0,0.3726075291633606,can you explain what you mean?,"yeah, there was this idea that if you had insight into it or somehow you’re not bothered by the attempts to discard it, you don’t have hoarding disorder."
2014,2014_230.txt,0,0.7500949501991272,so how do you define insight?,"well, i think insight is multi-dimensional."
2014,2014_231.txt,0,0.386103093624115,"if it was mostly externally driven, if it was mostly internally driven, how did people get there?",so almost everybody in our clinic who has hoarding disorder is there because they know they have hoarding disorder.
2014,2014_233.txt,0,0.6048540472984314,"so, i don’t know, i was very struck by this paper and this breakdown and i was just kind of wondering if you had read it, if you have thought about it.","no, i think i remember seeing it but not going through it, so i didn’t know about those four constructs or four factors that he was identifying."

2014,2014_235.txt,0,0.5050555467605591,"so is it more of a cognitive driven or more of a, i don’t know, i guess my question is breaking down so i’ll let you answer it.",i think different patients do have different motivations or different combinations.
2014,2014_236.txt,0,0.6262301206588745,if there is anything to that idea?,i would say i don’t think so.
2014,2014_236.txt,0,0.2592744529247284,and kind of the second thing that people say sometimes about hoarding disorder is that it’s related to early experiences of scarcity or somebody who’s experienced poverty and therefore reacts to it by having so much stuff and again is there anything to that idea in your experience.,"no, there isn’t."
2014,2014_237.txt,0,0.44787541031837463,"and just kind of as a closing out question, for you what do you think is the biggest unanswered questions about this disorder?","well, i think there’s several."
2015,2015_238.txt,0,0.4669966995716095,"so now we’re just going to get into a kind of semi-structure qualitative interview, and to start that off i’d just like you to give me a really brief idea of your professional background related to hoarding disorder, how you are involved with either research or treating patients with hoarding disorder.","yes, so i went to undergrad at NAME university where i majored in psychology and worked with several of the labs on campus doing research as an undergrad and became involved in a lab that studied anxiety and related disorders kind of more broadly, and so i ended up staying post my bachelor’s degree and getting a research assistant position there and a grant where i worked on anxiety treatment trials."
2015,2015_238.txt,0,0.5285599827766418,i know you said that it’s not your primary focus.,"no, i do not."
2015,2015_239.txt,0,0.347007155418396,"so in your mind, what are the most important differences between normal saving behaviors such as perhaps collecting or even extreme collecting and hoarding disorder?",if i had to name one thing i would say it’s the impairment that it causes.
2015,2015_239.txt,0,0.420295774936676,"i guess that’s maybe a tricky question but what i’m trying to get at is people change their lives and things have an impact on their lives, but what for you is really the line that pushes something like that into something that is an impairment?",that’s a good question.
2015,2015_240.txt,0,0.30379605293273926,"can you think of a specific case or an example of a patient where it was challenging to diagnose them, because it was on the border between pathological and non-pathological behavior?","yes, actually i can."
2015,2015_240.txt,0,0.6531413793563843,"so, for you the way that you made that distinction was that you took the cue from her in terms of her self-report of impairment or her self-report of distress.","yes, yeah for some part some impairment was very much self-reported in the sense that i did not know personally about her finances and never interacted with her or her husband in the room in a therapy session."
2015,2015_240.txt,0,0.5702983140945435,"and so, in terms of making the clinical distinction—even though it was kind of border line because she was self-reporting impairment—you went with her take on the situation.","yes, i mean i knew, given what she was presenting with, that that was the kind of reel on what she would fit diagnostically and i often times think about how would i treat this patient without necessarily making a clinical decision about a disorder—particularly when it can be a little bit, you know, maybe differentially, diagnostically could be a differential diagnostic question."
2015,2015_241.txt,0,0.4972403049468994,or things that are related to clinical judgement?,"let me think about that for a second, that’s a good question."
2015,2015_242.txt,0,0.24509043991565704,does that sound right?,"yeah, that’s sort of what i’m saying i mean i’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—i’m going to talk freely about this i hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, i mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common INAUDIBLE diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about oc it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and INAUDIBLE there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and i mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which i’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the oc and other related disorders like that impulsivity."
2015,2015_242.txt,0,0.46114128828048706,how do you determine if an aesthetic valuation is an inappropriate aesthetic valuation?,that’s a very good question.
2015,2015_243.txt,0,0.6645493507385254,how do you determine if a patient is appropriately valuing items?,i guess sometimes it’s in the number of things that they evaluate as valuable.
2015,2015_243.txt,0,0.5177568197250366,"and not so much that they correctly value valuable items and throw away trash, you know what i mean?",yeah that somethings have more—yeah that’s a good way to put it.
2015,2015_243.txt,0,0.2611190974712372,"and how do you determine, for example, if a person lives in a trailer vs if the person has the ability to have a very big house with two or three rooms for storage, how does that play into your ability to make a diagnosis of hoarding disorder?","yeah, that’s a really good question, one that i’ve thought about a lot."
2015,2015_244.txt,0,0.4099070727825165,or even going a step forward and using the surface of a desk to work on as opposed to using the surface of a desk for storage?,"yeah, i would say that’s when i would consider it kind of like on the line and maybe more subclinical."
2015,2015_244.txt,0,0.5919798612594604,how does that figure into it?,home size?
2015,2015_244.txt,0,0.32789599895477295,"so if you can keep acquiring stuff and have it not impair your life, you don’t have a disorder?","that would be my thought, yeah."
2015,2015_245.txt,0,0.5372702479362488,how do you assess distress in that context?,"that is hard, typically what i do when i was treating patients is we would do a behavioral experiment in the first session where i would actually ask them to bring in a couple of items, and the idea was that i was going to keep the items for a week and then they would be returned back to the patient just to kind of see and to get a gage like you know kind of like an actual behavioral design or experiment to check what their distress level was regarding parting with the item at the moment."
2015,2015_245.txt,0,0.5552833080291748,"so, they are able to self-identify themselves as having distress?","yes, they are not as able to identify the impairment, i would say, that’s where the insight comes in for me."
2015,2015_246.txt,0,0.48332735896110535,"and so, as we’ve talked about a lot of the literature surrounding hoarding disorder describes many hoarding patients as having low insight, and so the first question to start out with is how would you as a clinician define insight?",i mean think that i often times define it in impairment as well.
2015,2015_246.txt,0,0.5063790082931519,"mmhm, so like acknowledgement of distress.",yes.
2015,2015_246.txt,0,0.61152583360672,what level of insight do you think that most levels of patients that you’ve seen are?,let me think of some of the patients that i remember treating.
2015,2015_246.txt,0,0.4264119565486908,"and in your experience with the patients that you’ve seen, do you have any knowledge of how they came to gain that insight on their own or what the process was of them realizing their disorder?",for most of them it became impairment.
2015,2015_247.txt,0,0.4909130036830902,i’ll go through the list again if that would be helpful.,that would be.
2015,2015_247.txt,0,0.48737019300460815,which is the most important for you with patients with hoarding disorder?,"that’s a good question, i’ve definitely seen the first three in patients."
2015,2015_247.txt,0,0.5324611067771912,"and when you try to approach a patient who has low insight, what are some of the ways in which you help a patient to gain insight?","i guess sometimes i try to do, in my approach, kind of like alongside of reflecting back like you don’t see this as a problem so you can’t think of ways in which this isn’t the best for you."
2015,2015_248.txt,0,0.4927966594696045,"so rather than trying to force it on them, you get them to kind of say it.","yeah, versus getting them to understand what are some of the benefits of changing the behavior?"
2015,2015_248.txt,0,0.5263592004776001,what do they think?,"that’s actually a great question, i’ve actually talked with the people that i’ve worked with a lot."
2015,2015_249.txt,0,0.297354131937027,"that’s interesting, so she kind of saw hoarding as a self-protective, almost like a creation of a shell or a safe space?",yes!
2015,2015_249.txt,0,0.3844466507434845,"do you think that the cognition justifies something that’s going on in the brain and is justifying it, or do you think that the justifications are actually what’s causing the behavior?","gosh, that’s a very good question."
2015,2015_249.txt,0,0.7070648074150085,"yeah, i agree that it’s a very difficult question to answer and it’s been very interesting.","yeah, the questions you’re asking are so fascinating."
2015,2015_250.txt,0,0.3226343095302582,"do you think that hoarding disorder and the things that kind of play into people’s acquisition and keeping things, do you think that there is an aspect to which cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions and ownership, do you think that there’s any association between those two kinds of ideas in hoarding?",i think it would be hard for there not to be.
2015,2015_250.txt,0,0.2813720405101776,"do you think that that could have anything to do with the development of hoarding disorder, just because it seems like many hoarders talk about their possessions in terms of memory and forgetting?","yeah, and what’s the question?"
2015,2015_250.txt,0,0.34671729803085327,"yeah, no, i guess i just wanted to talk about that or to see if you had any thoughts on that issue of if you had encountered that?","i definitely have, i mean thinking about mardi gras like i said earlier, almost like every memory she had of mardi gras would be erased if she got rid of all the cups or maybe all the cups but one."
2015,2015_250.txt,0,0.4549943804740906,"and it’s interesting because it doesn’t sound like the cups were necessarily a reminder that the event existed, but more something in between, you know what i mean, more of like a physical acknowledgement.","representation of that, yes."
2015,2015_251.txt,0,0.5678113102912903,like they think that the memory will be gone and they will forget the memory or is it--?,"yes, i think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis i actually did a memory INAUDIBLE and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there."
2015,2015_251.txt,0,0.545230507850647,"i don’t think that’s ever come up in an interview before but that is, i think that brings very true...it’s something that nobody else has picked up on and something that i’d like to talk to you about.","yeah, it’s definitely fascinating."
2015,2015_251.txt,0,0.2994982600212097,that they have trouble distinguishing between things that that should be remembered and things that are able to be forgotten?,"yes, yeah, i don’t think i’ve ever thought about that but yes."
2016,2016_252.txt,0,0.535345196723938,"i want to be respectful of your time throughout this interview so if we get close to running out of time at any point please just let me know and we will stop, okay?",okay.
2016,2016_252.txt,0,0.37062251567840576,so first i'd just like to have you briefly give me a background on your own work with hoarding disorder in terms of your educational background and also how you came to be interested in hoarding disorder.,okay.
2016,2016_252.txt,0,0.4924900233745575,and you're mostly concerned with seeing patients clinically?,excuse me?
2016,2016_252.txt,0,0.5995975136756897,you're mostly concerned with clinical care of patients with hoarding disorder?,"yeah, that’s my, my work is clinical rather than research."
2016,2016_252.txt,0,0.6180509328842163,"so for you, what are the most important differences between what could be considered normal saving behavior, perhaps such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?","well, i think the most important discriminating factor is that the hoarding has gotten to the point where it’s interfering with their living situation, often a precluding safe entry or exit from their home, or causing them to not be able to use certain parts of their home, or their car for that matter."
2016,2016_252.txt,0,0.4687764346599579,"so for you, the distinction between normal saving behavior or even, you know, borderline cases like somebody who's an extreme collector is whether their home is still safe for that and able to be used, is that correct?","yeah, or they, you know, significant interference with their ability to use certain parts of their home, things like that."
2016,2016_252.txt,0,0.33547016978263855,"and could you just describe like how you, how you make a decision like that or does that never come up for you?",i honestly think that the people where i’ve thought that they had hoarding disorder was really pretty clear.
2016,2016_253.txt,0,0.7806262373924255,so very few borderline cases in your experience.,"yeah, i don’t see much that, that really falls in the borderline range of this kind of thing, you know."
2016,2016_253.txt,0,0.6294299960136414,so…,there’s considerable overlap.
2016,2016_253.txt,0,0.5379123687744141,"so these, these disorders are common, and do you ever feel like it's difficult to determine if somebody is primarily suffering from hoarding disorder or if for example, they're severely depressed and are just unable to clean up their space, does that ever become an issue for you and your practice?","the thing, realistically, i think they’re at the point where i think they’ve got a real hoarding problem."
2016,2016_253.txt,0,0.3337799906730652,so their primary problem might actually be depression.,yeah.
2016,2016_253.txt,0,0.5640490055084229,"and as you mentioned, that's a fairly recent conceptual distinction and i wonder how you see that play out in your own practice or if you think it’s a valid distinction to be made.","well, i think it’s a valid distinction and, again, in the past we used to consider hoarding just a variation of obsessive-compulsive disorder."
2016,2016_253.txt,0,0.3591964542865753,"so it seems like with that it is, in your mind, they are different, but they often can co-occur, although they can occur separately as well.",right.
2016,2016_253.txt,0,0.5746399760246277,"just again, this is not, we're not trying to get statistically significant, we're just asking people about their experiences with their patients that they find that it's very common in the patient populations that they see to have it overlap with ocd symptoms or if in their experience, it’s to be expected.","yeah, i, i think maybe 20-25% of people with hoarding are also people with ocd, i don’t…you know, i…that’s a guess."
2016,2016_254.txt,0,0.5732445120811462,i assume you do.,[inaudible ) i can’t quite hear.
2016,2016_254.txt,0,0.392907053232193,"i was just wondering if you use, i assume that you use the dsm five criteria in your practice with the intent of diagnosing an individual with hoarding disorder.",right.
2016,2016_254.txt,0,0.4998774826526642,perhaps things that are related to …,"i think that sort of generally true with the dsm, but i think they’re, they’re reasonably clear."
2016,2016_254.txt,0,0.5821884870529175,i can read them to you if you’d like.,"i actually turn to the right page, i..."
2016,2016_254.txt,0,0.586877167224884,"do you ever struggle with the idea of a hoarder’s possessions, having actual value?","well, you know, some people obviously are saving things that, that do have some financial value that could be sold or, you know, could be collected, kind of thing."
2016,2016_254.txt,0,0.38460323214530945,how does that fit into this criteria?,"yeah, yeah but, but they’re, they’re still collecting or hoarding in a way that doesn’t, treats that actual value in a way that makes sense."
2016,2016_254.txt,0,0.43396395444869995,"yeah, that makes sense.","it looks like, at least a reasonable amount of time they’re not treating it the way i would expect people to rationally treat things in terms of their value."
2016,2016_254.txt,0,0.4253981113433838,"so when you say rationally treat things in terms of their value, you mean, they might have a collection of objectively valuable items, but rather than, you know, selling them or displaying them, they just accumulate them.",they pile them in a corner somewhere.
2016,2016_255.txt,0,0.5320306420326233,how does that play into determining whether their possessions can just en-clutter their active living areas.,"well, i think even people that have got lots of resources and lots of property still can end up with what looks like hoarding, even if it’s, you know, not impacting them as much as it might somebody that has limited resources."
2016,2016_255.txt,0,0.47324737906455994,do you feel like it's easier to develop or to identify hoarding disorder in somebody who has a smaller space?,"i don’t know if it is… i can think of some people that i’ve worked with who, you know, have plenty of resources and just have lots and lots of stuff in various places."
2016,2016_255.txt,0,0.49218907952308655,"do you find that those kinds of distinctions are at play in making a diagnosis of hoarding disorder or do you find that it's very clear cut and, intended use isn’t easy?","most of time it is pretty clear that, that there are significant parts of their home, for example, that are compromised in the, in the, you know like, they can’t use the dining room table to eat at because it’s piled with stuff."
2016,2016_255.txt,0,0.36184272170066833,"did they just describe their living space to you, or do you have other ways of, of examining that question?","well, my other really useful thing there is to, a, send a pictures and rating scale…"
2016,2016_255.txt,0,0.3356662392616272,you use their rating scale.,"…that, in years, you know, it, it was developed by name and company."
2016,2016_256.txt,0,0.3936757743358612,and i wonder how you make the determination of how much distress is normal or abnormal when it comes to discarding.,"well, yeah if, if you can describe the, the sentimental attachment to an object that, again, fits with my conceptualization of how people usually think about objects."
2016,2016_256.txt,0,0.4774869978427887,so it sounds like there's barely borderline cases for you that it's usually pretty clear cut that the attachment is extreme.,"pretty much, yeah."
2016,2016_256.txt,0,0.6734296679496765,so the first thing i'd like to ask you is how you as a clinician understand the concept of insight.,"well, i think that i mean by the term insight is understanding that this particular way of dealing with things is really outside the range of what we expect in normal experience and is, in some ways, interfering with their living their lives."

2016,2016_256.txt,0,0.40380144119262695,what’s your process for helping a patient with low insight?,"well i, you know, i want to talk to them about what exact things are happening."
2016,2016_256.txt,0,0.5881448984146118,that’s what you concentrate on.,right.
2016,2016_257.txt,0,0.3015129864215851,"and, in your experience, the patients that come to you with high levels of insight already, how have they, or do you have any sense of how they have gained that insight on their own or before they've come to you?","i’m sorry, i lost a little bit of what you said [inaudible )"
2016,2016_257.txt,0,0.2523031234741211,"so when patients come to you and already are self-identifying as people who have a problem with hoarding disorder, do you have any sense of how they gained that insight or what the process was that led them to let them to come and seek treatment?",that’s a tough one.
2016,2016_258.txt,0,0.5068506002426147,"in your experience with people with hoarding disorder, do they, how do these different constructs breakdown in your patients?","well, i think the anosognosia kind of thing is certainly a presentation that is not unusual, again, more often folks that are brought to treatment [inaudible ) seek it themselves."
2016,2016_258.txt,0,0.7372870445251465,can you explain what you mean.,excuse me?
2016,2016_258.txt,0,0.4166456460952759,"i don’t, i’m not…","yeah, well, when we talk about people being defensive, i think it’s really conceptualized as, ordinarily at least, and, conceptualized as somehow you’re approaching something that is unconscious sleep, triggering their distress or whatever, and that’s a conceptualization model that i don’t think makes much sense."
2016,2016_258.txt,0,0.999997615814209,okay.,okay.
2016,2016_258.txt,0,0.4141297936439514,so defensiveness is more of a behavior or reaction rather than a construct.,yeah.
2016,2016_259.txt,0,0.39236152172088623,"so for you it seems that it’s more of a post hoc justification, but that there’s still avoidance based reasons for why they do things.",yeah.
2016,2016_259.txt,0,0.58819180727005,okay.,anything can be avoidance.
2016,2016_259.txt,0,0.5663881301879883,and i wonder if you have any sense for your patients how long their behavior has typically been going on before you see them?,"yeah, for most people it probably starts much earlier in life than we ever know about it."
2016,2016_259.txt,0,0.3699115216732025,"so it sounds like some little bit about this disorder is social and has to do with isolation, which is perhaps…","i think that increases it, yeah."
2016,2016_259.txt,0,0.44296932220458984,i mean i guess there’s also a cause and effect problem—,right.
2016,2016_260.txt,0,0.3462062478065491,"—in terms of whether people grow more isolated because of their behavior or their, you know, more isolated status enhances their behavior.","right, well i think it probably goes both directions."
2016,2016_260.txt,0,0.3966381847858429,do you ever feel that there are cultural forces associated with value that associate value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions that may play a role in the development of hoarding disorder or that…,"why, i think if it’s a factor, it’s not a dominant factor."
2016,2016_260.txt,0,0.46110159158706665,so…,"again, it’s related to these ideas that if i don’t have something, then i won’t feel bad."
2016,2016_260.txt,0,0.540579617023468,"in your experience, how does that balance out in the patients that you see?","well i think it varies across patients, but i think that both elements are likely to be present in practically ever hoarder."
2016,2016_260.txt,0,0.5677289366722107,"so for each patient there’s a little bit of both, for some there’s more of a positive acquiring, and for some there is more…","yeah, i think there is a variable mix, but i think most are present in practically everybody with hoarding."
2016,2016_260.txt,0,0.4718460440635681,how do you feel that figures into…,"i think it’s an important part of what maintains hoarding, but i think it’s because of misunderstanding of how memory works."
2016,2016_260.txt,0,0.37361085414886475,"so it seems to be the kind of like a, almost a cognitive mistaking the object with the memory.",right.
2016,2016_261.txt,0,0.42296233773231506,"but if you were to answer one question, what question…",okay.
2017,2017_262.txt,0,0.4669966995716095,"so now we’re just going to get into a kind of semi-structure qualitative interview, and to start that off i’d just like you to give me a really brief idea of your professional background related to hoarding disorder, how you are involved with either research or treating patients with hoarding disorder.","yes, so i went to undergrad at NAME university where i majored in psychology and worked with several of the labs on campus doing research as an undergrad and became involved in a lab that studied anxiety and related disorders kind of more broadly, and so i ended up staying post my bachelor’s degree and getting a research assistant position there and a grant where i worked on anxiety treatment trials."
2017,2017_262.txt,0,0.5285599827766418,i know you said that it’s not your primary focus.,"no, i do not."
2017,2017_263.txt,0,0.347007155418396,"so in your mind, what are the most important differences between normal saving behaviors such as perhaps collecting or even extreme collecting and hoarding disorder?",if i had to name one thing i would say it’s the impairment that it causes.
2017,2017_263.txt,0,0.420295774936676,"i guess that’s maybe a tricky question but what i’m trying to get at is people change their lives and things have an impact on their lives, but what for you is really the line that pushes something like that into something that is an impairment?",that’s a good question.
2017,2017_264.txt,0,0.30379605293273926,"can you think of a specific case or an example of a patient where it was challenging to diagnose them, because it was on the border between pathological and non-pathological behavior?","yes, actually i can."
2017,2017_264.txt,0,0.6531413793563843,"so, for you the way that you made that distinction was that you took the cue from her in terms of her self-report of impairment or her self-report of distress.","yes, yeah for some part some impairment was very much self-reported in the sense that i did not know personally about her finances and never interacted with her or her husband in the room in a therapy session."
2017,2017_264.txt,0,0.5702983140945435,"and so, in terms of making the clinical distinction—even though it was kind of border line because she was self-reporting impairment—you went with her take on the situation.","yes, i mean i knew, given what she was presenting with, that that was the kind of reel on what she would fit diagnostically and i often times think about how would i treat this patient without necessarily making a clinical decision about a disorder—particularly when it can be a little bit, you know, maybe differentially, diagnostically could be a differential diagnostic question."
2017,2017_265.txt,0,0.4972403049468994,or things that are related to clinical judgement?,"let me think about that for a second, that’s a good question."
2017,2017_266.txt,0,0.24509043991565704,does that sound right?,"yeah, that’s sort of what i’m saying i mean i’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—i’m going to talk freely about this i hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, i mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common INAUDIBLE diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about oc it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and INAUDIBLE there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and i mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which i’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the oc and other related disorders like that impulsivity."
2017,2017_266.txt,0,0.46114128828048706,how do you determine if an aesthetic valuation is an inappropriate aesthetic valuation?,that’s a very good question.
2017,2017_267.txt,0,0.6645493507385254,how do you determine if a patient is appropriately valuing items?,i guess sometimes it’s in the number of things that they evaluate as valuable.
2017,2017_267.txt,0,0.5177568197250366,"and not so much that they correctly value valuable items and throw away trash, you know what i mean?",yeah that somethings have more—yeah that’s a good way to put it.
2017,2017_267.txt,0,0.2611190974712372,"and how do you determine, for example, if a person lives in a trailer vs if the person has the ability to have a very big house with two or three rooms for storage, how does that play into your ability to make a diagnosis of hoarding disorder?","yeah, that’s a really good question, one that i’ve thought about a lot."
2017,2017_268.txt,0,0.4099070727825165,or even going a step forward and using the surface of a desk to work on as opposed to using the surface of a desk for storage?,"yeah, i would say that’s when i would consider it kind of like on the line and maybe more subclinical."
2017,2017_268.txt,0,0.5919798612594604,how does that figure into it?,home size?
2017,2017_268.txt,0,0.32789599895477295,"so if you can keep acquiring stuff and have it not impair your life, you don’t have a disorder?","that would be my thought, yeah."
2017,2017_269.txt,0,0.5372702479362488,how do you assess distress in that context?,"that is hard, typically what i do when i was treating patients is we would do a behavioral experiment in the first session where i would actually ask them to bring in a couple of items, and the idea was that i was going to keep the items for a week and then they would be returned back to the patient just to kind of see and to get a gage like you know kind of like an actual behavioral design or experiment to check what their distress level was regarding parting with the item at the moment."
2017,2017_269.txt,0,0.5552833080291748,"so, they are able to self-identify themselves as having distress?","yes, they are not as able to identify the impairment, i would say, that’s where the insight comes in for me."
2017,2017_270.txt,0,0.48332735896110535,"and so, as we’ve talked about a lot of the literature surrounding hoarding disorder describes many hoarding patients as having low insight, and so the first question to start out with is how would you as a clinician define insight?",i mean think that i often times define it in impairment as well.
2017,2017_270.txt,0,0.5063790082931519,"mmhm, so like acknowledgement of distress.",yes.
2017,2017_270.txt,0,0.61152583360672,what level of insight do you think that most levels of patients that you’ve seen are?,let me think of some of the patients that i remember treating.
2017,2017_270.txt,0,0.4264119565486908,"and in your experience with the patients that you’ve seen, do you have any knowledge of how they came to gain that insight on their own or what the process was of them realizing their disorder?",for most of them it became impairment.
2017,2017_271.txt,0,0.4909130036830902,i’ll go through the list again if that would be helpful.,that would be.
2017,2017_271.txt,0,0.48737019300460815,which is the most important for you with patients with hoarding disorder?,"that’s a good question, i’ve definitely seen the first three in patients."
2017,2017_271.txt,0,0.5324611067771912,"and when you try to approach a patient who has low insight, what are some of the ways in which you help a patient to gain insight?","i guess sometimes i try to do, in my approach, kind of like alongside of reflecting back like you don’t see this as a problem so you can’t think of ways in which this isn’t the best for you."
2017,2017_272.txt,0,0.4927966594696045,"so rather than trying to force it on them, you get them to kind of say it.","yeah, versus getting them to understand what are some of the benefits of changing the behavior?"
2017,2017_272.txt,0,0.5263592004776001,what do they think?,"that’s actually a great question, i’ve actually talked with the people that i’ve worked with a lot."
2017,2017_273.txt,0,0.297354131937027,"that’s interesting, so she kind of saw hoarding as a self-protective, almost like a creation of a shell or a safe space?",yes!
2017,2017_273.txt,0,0.3844466507434845,"do you think that the cognition justifies something that’s going on in the brain and is justifying it, or do you think that the justifications are actually what’s causing the behavior?","gosh, that’s a very good question."
2017,2017_273.txt,0,0.7070648074150085,"yeah, i agree that it’s a very difficult question to answer and it’s been very interesting.","yeah, the questions you’re asking are so fascinating."
2017,2017_274.txt,0,0.3226343095302582,"do you think that hoarding disorder and the things that kind of play into people’s acquisition and keeping things, do you think that there is an aspect to which cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions and ownership, do you think that there’s any association between those two kinds of ideas in hoarding?",i think it would be hard for there not to be.
2017,2017_274.txt,0,0.2813720405101776,"do you think that that could have anything to do with the development of hoarding disorder, just because it seems like many hoarders talk about their possessions in terms of memory and forgetting?","yeah, and what’s the question?"
2017,2017_274.txt,0,0.34671729803085327,"yeah, no, i guess i just wanted to talk about that or to see if you had any thoughts on that issue of if you had encountered that?","i definitely have, i mean thinking about mardi gras like i said earlier, almost like every memory she had of mardi gras would be erased if she got rid of all the cups or maybe all the cups but one."
2017,2017_274.txt,0,0.4549943804740906,"and it’s interesting because it doesn’t sound like the cups were necessarily a reminder that the event existed, but more something in between, you know what i mean, more of like a physical acknowledgement.","representation of that, yes."
2017,2017_275.txt,0,0.5678113102912903,like they think that the memory will be gone and they will forget the memory or is it--?,"yes, i think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis i actually did a memory INAUDIBLE and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there."
2017,2017_275.txt,0,0.545230507850647,"i don’t think that’s ever come up in an interview before but that is, i think that brings very true...it’s something that nobody else has picked up on and something that i’d like to talk to you about.","yeah, it’s definitely fascinating."
2017,2017_275.txt,0,0.2994982600212097,that they have trouble distinguishing between things that that should be remembered and things that are able to be forgotten?,"yes, yeah, i don’t think i’ve ever thought about that but yes."
2018,2018_276.txt,0,0.5738174915313721,"and just to begin, i would like if you wouldn't mind for you to just give me a brief introduction of your background related to hoarding disorder, your education and how you are involved with hoarding disorder.","a ph.d. in behavioral analysis and my thesis was on hoarding in animal models, of the neural basis and evolution of hoarding in non-humans."
2018,2018_276.txt,0,0.49067172408103943,what do you mean by individual differences?,people who are not clinically diagnosed who vary on the degree to which they express tendencies for hoarding.
2018,2018_276.txt,0,0.6444944739341736,"or even on the extreme end of normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?","i think it’s normal, and everyone, to some degree, saves things they think might be useful or memorabilia."
2018,2018_276.txt,0,0.3807874619960785,so the environment itself is what distinguishes it.,"i would say for the most part, but i’d say someone with a clinical disorder is not receptive or malleable like, to intervention."
2018,2018_276.txt,0,0.2961931526660919,okay.,"so like, if it’s a person who has a hoarding tendency but they don’t have a disorder, if you went to their house and you tried to help them go through things, they can probably do it."
2018,2018_276.txt,0,0.5251165628433228,that makes sense.,they’re more resistant than a typical person.
2018,2018_277.txt,0,0.6055887341499329,did you ever…?,what’s the question exactly?
2018,2018_277.txt,0,0.44357097148895264,"just to have you talk through a specific case that was particularly difficult to decide whether or not it constituted hoarding disorder and how you ended up making the decision, of what, of what it was or what it wasn't.","well, for example, we have cases where people have extremely full areas of the house, like a garage or basement or an attic."
2018,2018_277.txt,0,0.6183682680130005,and so for you—,yeah.
2018,2018_277.txt,0,0.6868032813072205,does that sound right?,right.
2018,2018_277.txt,0,0.5252659916877747,do you find that those distinctions are difficult to make?,not really.
2018,2018_277.txt,0,0.355813205242157,"so their house is completely filled with like sports memorabilia or something like that, but not indiscriminate items?",yeah.
2018,2018_278.txt,0,0.38371142745018005,"how do you decide if, how do you use that value criteria in the dsm-5 criteria?","well, there’s a lot of objects in hoarding where, like you paid money for it, but then as a used item, it’s almost worthless."
2018,2018_278.txt,0,0.37227529287338257,so literal—,"so, if they wanted to sell it, would they get really money for it that would be the [inaudible ) of lunch more than like, pocket change."
2018,2018_278.txt,0,0.289075642824173,but the items that they're hoarding are actually objectively valuable.,i think that is extremely rare…
2018,2018_278.txt,0,0.4900662899017334,sure.,"… to think this, this extremely rare, it’s certainly not like, very typical case."
2018,2018_278.txt,0,0.735636830329895,"okay, that makes sense.",yeah.
2018,2018_278.txt,0,0.41399484872817993,even if it substantially compromises the intended use of the space?,"yeah, i would say [inaudible ), like there’s some, like, magical case where it has no bearing on their life, and now, i just think it’s like so unlikely, i’ll just sign off."
2018,2018_279.txt,0,0.5843734741210938,"okay. so, kind of taking a step back from the dsm-5 criteria, when you think about the criteria overall, are there any elements of the criteria that you find particularly difficult to apply to patients or that you sometimes wonder that different clinicians might apply differently or that are more or less reliant on clinical judgment?","i think it’s weird for them to say that it has to include distress, to a point of distress, because the patients have so little insight and they’re so, like, self-justifying in their behavior."
2018,2018_279.txt,0,0.3156476318836212,i understand.,which is a reason i think it's hard to treat because they don't show up at the clinic because they don't want help.
2018,2018_279.txt,0,0.5382468104362488,"right, so the problem with—",that’s what i think is weird.
2018,2018_279.txt,0,0.29801061749458313,"—yeah, the problem with insight prevents them from being distressed unless, unless somebody is trying to take their stuff away essentially.",right.
2018,2018_279.txt,0,0.5423725843429565,is that a part of this distress resulting from accumulation in a space and not being able to use that space?,i would say no because i think people buy and still to the extent of the space and capacity for doing so.
2018,2018_279.txt,0,0.36510369181632996,right.,"like, that you should be getting rid of but refuse to, it’s filled with stuff like you actually need but you have trouble finding somewhere to put it."
2018,2018_280.txt,0,0.3858951926231384,is it pretty clear?,"i don't think it matters what culture was assigned the use for that room, i just think it matters like, what you need to be doing on a daily basis is compromised."
2018,2018_280.txt,0,0.5611290335655212,so…,"i do think that’s a factor, yes."
2018,2018_280.txt,0,0.3256909251213074,okay.,"i think because of the fear element, having the item surrounding a person, it’s like literally a sense of security and they feel uncomfortable in empty areas or cleared out areas."

2018,2018_280.txt,0,0.4122236967086792,how would you define insight?,being aware that you have a problem that is not typical and that would be better off un-needing it.

2020,2020_294.txt,0,0.6801474094390869,"okay, thank you for that. um, so it sounds like you have a very broad experience, both with individual patients, with research, and with working with communities. so, for the first part of our interview, we're trying to focus on how you conceive of hoarding as a disorder, how you diagnose it, how you know it when you see it. and then we're going to move to the discussion of insight, and the purpose of this process is to understand how clinicians are looking at hoarding disorder, and then to talk to patients about how they identify the disorder in themselves and the purpose of that is to help understand the patient process of gaining insight. so, for you as a clinician, what are some of the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps collecting, and hoarding disorder?","so the excessive accumulation of material to the point that it impairs their ability to function. it's not organized as in a collection, it's not useful as in a collection, it takes over and impairs their ability to function. people with hoarding disorder typically are distressed by it, unlike collectors, and describe difficulty discarding, which collectors will not except perhaps in relation to the enlargement of their collection and material that may be a little peripheral to it. excessive acquiring of items."
2020,2020_295.txt,0,0.7293368577957153,"so it sound like the biggest difference in your mind that there are kind of maybe, it sound like from what you just said maybe two main differences. one is that the items themselves are so excessive and exist in a disordered state that they can really impair the person's ability to function; while in a collection, you wouldn't expect such excessive acquisition and they would be more organized and it wouldn't impair function. does that sound right?","yeah, and displayed suitably, maintained, controlled, yeah. without the difficulty discarding, generally speaking, that we see in hoarders. so in hoarders, i look for a pervasive difficulty discarding, saving of everything, it's not thematically connected, it's not necessarily a collection at all, it has nothing to do with collecting, often the presence of insight, the recognition that it's excessive themselves but not always."
2020,2020_295.txt,0,0.7413607239723206,"could you have a person with hoarding disorder who hoards particular items? so, somebody who fills their home completely with cuckoo clocks or clown memorabilia. so, i guess what i'm getting at is is the non-discriminant aspect a key, or is it possible to have a patient with hoarding disorder who is discriminating to come extent, along the lines of the ways that a collector might?","i guess i've seen some who have that, i mean usually all hoarders gravitate to certain kinds of material. so, if it's newspaper i don't think most people would think of it as collecting, but i've also seen hoarders who's collection, one guy for example, who collected model cars. but, again, his accumulation of cars was excessive, he had multiples of cars, they had overtaken his home to the point that he could not live in it appropriately, could not have people over, was worried about it being a fire hazard and getting inspected, he identified himself as unable to discard things or part with things. and so, even though there was a thematic connection, and some qualities in common with a collector, it went way beyond."
2020,2020_295.txt,0,0.5874403715133667,"can you think of ever encountering a case or cases that was really on the borderline and was challenging to diagnose for that reason, where you were really unsure if it was hoarding disorder or not?",hoarding vs. collecting? no.
2020,2020_295.txt,0,0.4668380320072174,"hoarding versus collecting, no never?","no, i don't think so actually."
2020,2020_295.txt,0,0.7312933802604675,"how about on the boarder between hoarding and an alternative diagnosis, such as ocd or depression? do you find that distinction to be difficult to make sometimes clinically?","generally not, generally not. i certainly will see a lot of hoarding disorder that is comorbid and exasperated by ocd, and i will see people with ocd who accumulate because of their ocd where i don't think it's hoarding, so i certainly see all the gray zones in there. i don't find that one causes me a whole lot of difficulty, generally speaking."
2020,2020_296.txt,0,0.6389211416244507,"and when you're telling between them, it seems like what you're saying is it goes back to the root cause of the behavior. that ocd can cause accumulation of items similar to hoarding disorder, but still be driven by ocd motivations.","absolutely, so people with, i have numerous in my practice, with contamination concerns who can't touch things they're brought in the house because of cleanliness versus dirtiness and they need to do washing rituals and end up avoiding handling things and end up avoiding discarding for that reason. i have individuals with fears of something incriminating being on any paper material, and so they have to check it, or being worried about throwing out something valuable getting mixed in with the items they want to discard, so the checking rituals become prohibitory difficult. you know, somebody with obsessions around personal information and identity theft, who looks to all intensive purposes superficially like a hoarder because he accumulates everything that comes in the door, but it's really about his concern around identity theft and his having to check it meticulously to make sure he didn't somehow get a piece of mail mixed up with it or something that has his phone number or credit card number or any other information on it. so, i've seen a broad variety of cases like that, but i think usually when you explore the motivation for the difficulty around the discarding, i feel clinically myself that it's not all that difficult to tease apart."
2020,2020_296.txt,0,0.4758627712726593,have you ever encountered a case of sub-clinical hoarding?,many.
2020,2020_296.txt,0,0.3000413775444031,and what does that look like?,"um, people who will comment to me that they feel they have a bit of excessive accumulation, they may themselves note that they have a bit of difficulty discarding, it's hard for them to do it, they feel a sense of reluctance to part with things, but they'll tell me, you know, eventually they get to it or they've build up a safety network with a family member checking in with them ever 3 months, if they themselves have difficulty, to kind of help them work through it so that they say when we discuss the condition of their home, that their accumulation of material does not in any way impact on their ability to live the way they want to live in their home or use the space suitably, not in a significant way."
2020,2020_296.txt,0,0.6088500022888184,"so, it's subclinical in that case, even though they have the impulse, they're able to kind of keep it in check and manage their space.","with difficulty often, yeah that would be the kind of, profile in my mind of a subclinical hoarder."
2020,2020_297.txt,0,0.6166142225265503,"okay, so now i'd like to talk through the dsm-v criteria pretty briefly. are there any aspects of the dsm-v criteria that you find particularly difficult to apply or that you have thought that different clinicians may apply differently? either things to do with the language or related to clinical judgement?","um, for the most part i feel like criteria works pretty well, actually. i've questioned, in the early days i was strongly influenced by gail steketee and randy frost, thinking about acquiring as a core feature and wondered if it shouldn't be up there as a diagnostic feature, but over the years i've seen so many who don't endorse it as an active part, that if it were a requirement for diagnosis, it would have to be an option, right, it would have to be not absolutely required. so, i think that's actually fair, that's been a change in my thinking over the years. i sometimes think the language around the urge to save things is just a little bit, maybe just a little bit awkward potentially, because i think when i meet with individuals, you know it just says difficulty discarding regardless of the actual--the need to save due to distress associated with discarding. i think that's part of it, but for many of them it's also the strong urge to keep things. and sometimes i will meet people who say, ""it's not that i can't discard them, i just feel the need to keep everything cuz i might want it or need it."" so, sometimes the way that the criteria is phrased sometimes seems like a slightly awkward fit to me for that reason."
2020,2020_297.txt,0,0.7198609113693237,"mhhm, so one of the criteria discussed kind of difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of actual value, and i'm wondering if you ever think of the value of items as part of your kind of process. do you have to have value, does the objective value of the item play into it? so, could someone, for instance, hypothetically hoard extremely valuable items? there was a, for instance as an example, a case of an art collector who's house was completely filled and absolutely unorganized and unmanageable, but all of the objects were, you know, priceless art artifacts or paintings and sculptures. so is the value of the items a part of your use of that diagnostic criteria?","no, not really. no, i wouldn't say that if they were living in a disorganized state, identified having more stuff than space to keep it, and it was compromising their pleasure and ability to live normally in their home, even if it's all objectively value, but i would still see it as hoarding."
2020,2020_298.txt,0,0.719904363155365,"so, one of the criteria that clinicians have talked about in different ways is the one that says that the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas, and substantially compromises their intended use. so, i guess the question that this criteria begs for me is different people live in difference spaces, you know, if you are living in a trailer you have very little space and you require very few items to congest and compromise it, whereas if you are extremely wealthy and can afford six storage units and have a huge house, you may never reach the point where your living area is substantially compromised. and i'm wondering how you think about that when you go through the process of using this criteria?","i think it can be a conundrum and it can cloud and potentially lead to under diagnose of those who are in the wealthier economic strata. but, on the other hand, when i've met individuals like that who have the luxury of lots of space, they're typically also not distressed by the problem because they have enough space that they can still live very well in the space they have. and so, from the perspective of distress or impairment, they won't meet either. so, if i may i can give you one very straight forward example like that, who's an individual i've seen on and off for years for ocd who is from a very wealthy family. he lives alone in a 5 bedroom home, and has essentially a butler to assist him. he buys about 30 bespoke suits a year even though he doesn't have more than a few occasions a year to wear them, and he has accumulated all the old ones, not to mention other types of items of clothing, such that in his five bedroom home, he sleeps in one bedroom, has one room that's a guest room, and the other three are closet space."
2020,2020_298.txt,0,0.24817277491092682,wow,"right? he is not distressed by it, he objectively recognizes that he accumulates too much, and he would say that he has trouble parting with the old ones and he sees that it's excessive, the acquiring of them, but it doesn't really distress him in any meaningful way, it doesn't impair him. he has the ability to function beautifully in his house and has people over all the time, his butler helps him keep his clothing collection organized, there's no hardship. from a neurobiological perspective, i think he's somebody who in a research study if our criteria didn't exclude him, would probably show the same neurobiological issues but don't think that clinically he's at threshold, because of his material wealth and ability to live comfortably."
2020,2020_299.txt,0,0.43774792551994324,"it is an interesting facet of hoarding disorder that someone can have the same neurobiology and have the same thoughts and even the same behaviors but, because of their kind of socioeconomic status, just not have a disorder. it's been difficult for me to think of another disorder like that, where you just won't be diagnosed with it. so, i don't know","actually, well, i'm gonna just put out there, if you think about it for a moment, mild adhd in people who have moved into creative professions, where they're required and praised for their ingenuity and innovativeness and creativity, i've seen a few individuals throughout the years who have told me that if they didn't have their inattentiveness, that they think it would be more difficult for them to come up with some of those ideas. you know, they're not quite the same, but there's a bit of that. i think people with bipolar disorder, where the manias are mostly cyclic mood disorders where they have hypomanias or have has few manias but long periods of hypomania, who would tell me they don't want to go on mood stabilizers because they work in a creative area, such as writing, and they worry it would impact their ability to come up with their ideas."

2020,2020_299.txt,0,0.7405441999435425,"sure, and i guess the other difficulty with hoarding disorder is that distress criteria. so, this person is not meeting distress criteria, because objectively speaking, his home is not compromised. but many hoarders don't endorse distress because they have such as low insight into their behavior. and so that's sort of the--","right, and then i look at the behavior. i mean, that's where i think, because we have the impairment or inability to maintain safety for yourself or others, it's not perfect, and you're absolutely right, i hadn't given that enough thought when you asked about problems with the criteria, but typically in those situations we'll say there's some concern, they deny that it's a problem. i have a lady like that with ocd and hoarding, she's been evicted 5 times, she generally over the years has denied that her hoarding is a big problem it just angers others around her. but objectively, there would certainly be a fire hazard and a times, she'd have vermin, so, right? i think the criteria aren't bad as an effort to try and get at that and give us enough venue."
2020,2020_300.txt,0,0.7795107364654541,"sure, and you know, this interview isn't an effort to discredit the criteria, it's just kind of an effort to think through them and to understand kind of how clinicians are applying them. it's interesting for that reason, and it's also interesting because you know different people can have different ideas on a normal spectrum of how much is too much. so, some people really like having clutter around, they feel better in a space that's more full of items than others, and we wouldn't think that that's strange, but it crosses a line with hoarding disorder in terms of safety and sometimes not with distress, sometimes with distress. so, i'm wondering again, like the beautiful example you gave of the man with his bespoke suits, would it be possible to have hoarding disorder with, for example, digital media? so, could somebody hoard emails and books online, and pdfs, and have just hard drives full of material and would that be a hoarder?","i've had trouble with that one. i mean, people ask about it, i've read about it myself, and i've had clients who do have problems with accumulating a lot of online material, far more than they could ever use, review, even access because it's not, they're not able to organize it appropriately anymore. but, i'm a little hard pressed, because if it were solely the digital media, i've not seen someone where it's solely digital accumulation without physical accumulation of other material. so, in those cases where i've seen the two coexisting, i would say that the electronic acquiring or accumulation is a feature of their hoarding difficulty. i guess i haven't been presented with a person who solely accumulates digitally and who would say their living circumstances physically are fine. i don't know what that would look like and how i would feel comfortable applying the diagnostic criteria, unless they were really distressed by their accumulation or reported spending too much time and effort, for example, on trying to catalog or organize it, i haven't read into that. but i think that if i heard somebody with that kind of description, where they've said, ""i myself am distressed by my electronic accumulation, i spend too much time acquiring electronic materials, i can't organize them to find what i want and it's troubling me and getting in the way because i'm spending so much effort on it,"" that would probably be them somebody i might end up diagnosing as an ocrd not otherwise specified kind of situation. but i've never seen one like that, so i don't know if those really exist."
2020,2020_300.txt,0,0.38944849371910095,"it's kind of along the lines of the collector example, where people may do that, but it's very rarely confined to one sphere like that.",yeah.
2020,2020_301.txt,0,0.773867130279541,"another area that i've thought about is this substantially compromises intended use. so, in the example of the patient that you gave, he has five bedrooms and 3 of which are closets, which is not their intended use, and i guess, who, how do you decide where it crosses the line for intended use? i mean, someone may store stuff in a bathtub and say, ""i don't take baths, i'll shower at the gym."" someone may store stuff on the stove and say, ""well i don't ever cook and i don't know how to cook, so it makes sense for me to use my stove as a storage space."" i guess what i'm saying is, is there a line with that intended use aspect of the criteria, or is it all kind of about functional status and safety?","that's a really good one, interviewer. i think it comes down mostly to the distress and functional status and safety. because, like in the example of my patient, who says the bedroom is a sleeping place? i mean he has a very large home, it's about 4,000 square feet, so just because the builder defined it as bedrooms, doesn't to me mean that they're not useful for their intended use."
2020,2020_301.txt,0,0.4757181704044342,"mhhm, yeah that's kind of what i was getting at is you know, if it's your space, if that's your home,","it defines it accordingly, but and it--so your interesting one is what if it covers the stovetop but the person says, ""i never cook, i never have cooked, i never wish to cook."" so, i think if somebody told me that, they've never cooked, they've never fried, they don't own frying pans, they don't have any desire to learn to fry an egg or to put up boiling water on a stovetop, so for them it is not a concern or a problem in any way, shape or form, then i would be hard pressed to find hoarding or clutter that's excessive simply based on that stovetop example. however, it's rarely in isolation. it's going to impact multiple areas of the home, and i would suspect there would be other areas where it's much more clearcut. but, i think you're right, it will be colored by their insight and justification. so, the hoarders i see, when i ask where they sleep who say they sleep on their comfy chair but they prefer it to their bed, they think they sleep better upright, so they don't want to sleep in their bed anyway, where you're right, i'm opposing my own judgment. i'm saying i think that's getting in the way of its intended use."
2020,2020_302.txt,0,0.5177159905433655,"and that's a difficult distinction, i mean, there are clinicians and researchers who think of hoarding disorder as a way of kind of making the space more conformable, so who kind of conceive of it as people who like to be surrounded by items, who feel safer and more at home when they are kind of closed in a little bit, and so i guess what that kind of gets at is at what point are we saying that people's homes, that they can't kind of manage their own space in a way that feels good to them? and making that distinction i guess can be difficult unless it's a very clear kind of safety and health hazard.","yeah, yeah. i don't have a clear answer, i guess. it does come down to like a INAUDIBLE judgment on my part sometimes about whether it's getting in the way of their ability to function and their intended use. you're right, there can be gray zones."
2020,2020_302.txt,0,0.8371957540512085,"and, i guess, the next part of the interview, this leads into it quite nicely because the last part of the dsm-v that i'd like to discuss with you is about distress and then talking about insight. so, um, one really interesting thing that i've encountered in these interviews is the way that different clinicians think about this distress associated with discarding. so, some people kind of apply this criteria to mean they are distressed by their behavior, their behavior distresses them and they recognize that their life is impaired, and other people say ""no, actually that's not required at all, that's not what's meant by distress, what's meant is that they would hypothetically experience distress if they were discarding. so there is no actual distress in the disorder itself, when they keep their items they're fine, but if you try to make them throw it away, that's when they would experience distress and that's what the criteria is getting at. so, i'm wondering how you apply that distress criteria?","i usually interpret it as, i totally agree with the second group, that there are hoarders who don't have distress except when they're forces to discard, and if they've been successfully avoiding it for enough time, it's not a problem. but then the way that i apply the criteria is that they don't meet distress, but i will look for impairment instead. the way i am looking for distress to use the diagnostic criteria is distress at the problem, distress at the way they're living, or distress of the way it's bringing them into conflict with others or the impact on their finances from their excessive acquiring. but, distressed at some aspect of the problem, which absolutely correctly you're pointing out will only be there if there is some degree of insight."
2020,2020_302.txt,0,0.7033524513244629,"so, let's talk about insight, one thing that i ask clinicians is to tell me how they would define insight in the case of hoarding. what does insight mean?",i think insight typically here means the recognition of the excessive feature of their accumulated belongings. and the recognition that it is getting in the way of their being able to live the kind of ritual filling life they would otherwise like to lead.
2020,2020_302.txt,0,0.7965582609176636,"so insight for you involves recognition that their behavior is impairing. so, distress is a key feature of insight for you.","distress is more related to insight, yeah."
2020,2020_303.txt,0,0.6898180246353149,"so, could a person have insight and say, ""yeah i have hoarding disorder and this behavior is abnormal and its impairing my life, but it's my life and i want to keep my items"" is that a patient with insight, or where would insight kind of fit into that for that patient? they recognize their disorder is real, but they don't want to change it. they don't feel distressed by it, could you have insight without distress?","yes, i'd say if you recognize that they still have a problem in the way they relate to stuff, they're still insightful about one aspect of the problem, they may say it's poor insight, depending on how they described it and depending on what i was objectively hearing about their life."
2020,2020_303.txt,0,0.6632233262062073,"and when you see patients, how much insight do they typically have when they come to you?","so the population i see typically ranges between fair to good insight, because i am a psychiatrist to which people are referred for treatment. i'm not out there in the community, i'm at a hospital setting, a tertiary care hospital setting. i mean i get the occasional one where they're coming just because their family members have pushed them, but they're a small minority of the people i see myself."
2020,2020_303.txt,0,0.5185084342956543,"and so when you're seeing people who have reasonably good insight, do you have any idea how they gained insight on their own or what that process looked like for them?","i don't know that i do have a good feel for that, it typically comes on gradually but no i would say i don't have any specific understanding of what triggered them to begin to recognize that it was a problem."
2020,2020_304.txt,0,0.5342366099357605,"so, there was this paper published by randy frost where he talks about the concept of insight, and he in the paper broke it down into different constructs, and i'd like to read you these constructs and have you think with me through which in your mind are the most important or how you see them related to each other. so the constructs that randy came up with are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness, overvalued ideation, so that would be more of a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items, or indifference. um, and i'm wondering how you see these fitting together in people's insight. so, these are interesting to me because they are so varied. so, overvalued ideation or anosognosia even, sound almost more like a delusional disorder where you're looking at an item and you have an unreasonable belief that the item is more valuable than it is, or you're looking at your space and you think that your space looks normal, even though is objectively, you know no one with objectivity would see it as normal. whereas defensiveness is much more based on behavior and indifference also is very behavioral and seems sort of like related to depression and just not caring about space. so, i guess what i'm getting at with this question is how do you think about these and do you see them all as equally relevant or do you feel like some are more central to insight as you understand it in hoarding disorder?","so, i have to confess i have not given this any thought before and i haven't seen that paper, so this is the first i'm hearing about this model for insight or the different aspects of insight, but i think it's really interesting and kind of a-- what was the first one again?"

2020,2020_304.txt,0,0.3435865640640259,"okay, how so?","well i kind of, so the others are like core features of their... would define why they don't have insight. whereas defensiveness is more of a reaction to some insight, and not wishing to acknowledge a problem. so in a way defensiveness almost implies some degree on insight."
2020,2020_304.txt,0,0.5249563455581665,"mhhm, in order to be defensive you have to know that there's something to defend.","exactly, so don't know that i would agree with defensiveness being one of the constructs. but the other three sound really good and right on to me, actually, and very much map onto my experience."
2020,2020_304.txt,0,0.6324662566184998,"so, do you see a degree of, i mean i don't want to overstate it, but something along the lines of a delusion with hoarding patients? do you think that when they look at items they are literally delusional at times in terms of their beliefs?","i've seen, i have not, i know that it's described, i have not really seen people. i'm trying to think if i have seen people who i thought were clearly at the delusional rather than poor or almost absent insight. i don't think i've actually seen anybody where i've termed it delusional."
2020,2020_305.txt,0,0.6418693661689758,"so i guess what i'm imagining here is somebody who's space is just really, you know, over cluttered. like the example you gave where there's rodents, they're being evicted, and they look at their space and they say, ""this looks fine to me, this looks like a normal home"" and i guess i'm wondering is is that because they're in denial about it? or is that because they truly are looking at something and seeing something different than reality?","so i think there is this perceptual problem, the anosognosia, which could also be termed in a milder form as clutter blindness, right? and so i see that all the time in some of my people with hoarding where they really don't see it registering the same way others would and i find photos very useful in that regard, because sometimes they'll take photos and bring them in to show me, and when we look at the photos together they together will say, ""that looks a lot worse than i realized, i see what you're seeing and i hadn't looked at it that way."" that part of it really fits, and so many overvalued ideations i see all the time, but to call them truly delusional as a psychiatrist, i'm trying to think whether i've seen anybody."
2020,2020_305.txt,0,0.636728048324585,"i guess part of the reason i'm curious is because i've also been talking to people about animal hoarding, and people who talk about animal hoarding are very comfortable, or some of them are anyway,","i'm sorry, yes, yes let me take that back. one case i've seen, who was an animal hoarder who i thought was frankly delusional, you're right. but he didn't have any other feature of hoarding, he actually had severe ocd and some INAUDIBLE issues. but, i did believe he was delusional."

2020,2020_306.txt,0,0.5851054787635803,i think it's because animal hoarding is even worse than object hoarding in terms of people ever seeking treatment or staying in treatment.,"yeah, yeah, so i just haven't had them, so it's a really really interesting question. um, but that one case who comes clearly to my mind was somebody where i realized after time that only when frankly, anyway there's a number of complications in his case that make it even more interesting and complicated, but i ended up coming to the decision that he had, i called him a delusional disorder and it was with regard to the animals because he describes himself as safe keeping them and taking care of these animals that would otherwise be destroyed eventually, and when i next had contact was after there had been a home inspection and housing authorities and spca etcetera had gotten involved, and they reported animals in his home that had died and in deplorable conditions. and even so, when i met him he maintained in a way that i found seemed totally believable and frankly delusional that he was taking good care of them."
2020,2020_306.txt,0,0.5838174223899841,"yeah, that seems to be a pretty common experience with animal hoarders and i've gotten really curious about the relationship between the two disorders because behaviorally, and kind of conceptually, it makes sense that they would be related and both related to ocd, but there seems to be something about animal hoarding that crosses lines that object hoarding just doesn't seem to cross. and, this wasn't, i don't think this was actually on your list but sometimes clinicians will talk about their patients with hoarding disorder who kind of over-identify with objects or over-empathize with objects of have some emotional connections with objects","oh yeah, absolutely i've seen that one, i missed it. an individual of mine who sees objects as having feelings and the ways she treats it is core to the difficulty discarding, because if you treat anything with disrespect and make it feel like its unwanted would be hurting it, yeah."
2020,2020_306.txt,0,0.2590935230255127,"and i'm wondering almost if animal hoarding is maybe an extension of that aspect of object hoarding, where animals are, they kind of over-empathize with them are they are so concerned about harm to them that they, i don't know i'm still working on it, that might be a future direction but i wanted to get your ideas. i have a couple of closing questions, so i don't want to keep you longer than you have though, so if you need to go just let me know.","i have 5 minutes, okay, but then i do have to wrap up."
2020,2020_306.txt,0,0.27007102966308594,"yeah, absolutely. so, this is a hard one, but we talked about the reasons that people give for their hoarding behavior, and i'm wondering if you think that these are the real reasons that they're saving, the reasons that they give, or are these reasons post-hoc justifications for an underlying biological need, which they will do and then they'll kind of retrospectively justify them cognitively?",i don't know how you would test that model.
2020,2020_306.txt,0,0.5261107087135315,"yeah, i guess it's just a speculative question it's not a testable one.","i'm trying to see offhand a way that you would do a study which would enable you to discriminate that. if i say then give that as the reason, and they seem to believe that, even if it's post hoc, how are we going to distinguish that?"
2020,2020_307.txt,0,0.36343294382095337,"sure, so maybe it's not even a meaningful distinction for that reason.","not that i see it right now. now it might be once we developed, if we could develop and identify a good biomarker of hoarding disorder, then you could begin to test that, right?"
2020,2020_307.txt,0,0.4630813002586365,"yeah, the analogy that i was thinking of is like a compulsive disorder or like an impulse control problem, where you do something and you can't help but do it and then afterwards you think of a reason why you did it. and if hoarding is like that, if hoarding is a behavioral driven and then kind of afterwards cognitively driven or cognitively justified, but you're right that would be very difficult to test.",i don't think it's testable currently. i'd be really interested if somebody found a way to do it.
2020,2020_307.txt,0,0.5684506893157959,"as a final question, i'm wondering if you have any idea from your patients and conversations with them how long their behavior's been going on and how it developed over the course of their life. do they describe it as starting at a certain point? and i guess the reason i'm asking this is hoarding is, as you i'm sure know, if more prevalent in elderly people and i've wondered is that because of the social factors? is that because those people tend to be more isolated and perhaps living alone and they've had the impulse or the behavior their whole life and it only reaches clinical levels as they get older and less able to deal with it? do you have any idea about that from your patients?","yeah, so one thing i often talk about with my patients is differentiating between the difficulty they have in the way they relate to stuff, and the legacy in the years of accumulation, and i think there's inadequate weight given to that distinction. so that, for example, i will see many people who go through a course of cbt or an INAUDIBLE treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. and so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. but, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. sorry i'm trying to think now what your question was."
2020,2020_308.txt,0,0.6755399703979492,"yeah, about the life course kind of of hoarding disorder and how it is impacted by age.","yeah, so the reason i was mentioning that, which i think is a real problem in the way we often understand hoarding and i think it's a real problem with patients who understand hoarding that leads them to minimize the gains in treatment or to see them as relatively lacking in value because that legacy is still there, is that often the insight only seems to develop as a result of those years of the legacy of the accumulation. so, many people i see will say when they look back absolutely as it's been reported in other studies, you know they identified difficulty with discarding going back to their early adult years or teens or sometimes even late childhood, but the accumulation took time to get out of control and quite often i find hoarders that i see who are usually in their 40s to 60s, although i've seen some younger ones, will often say it got out of control because of environmental changes. their spouse left them of their relationship ended or their children moved out or their aging parents downsized or died. and as a result they've been presented with even more stuff and it totally overwhelmed their ability and their limited ability to cope with it and to deal. at that point, they now recognize the problem. so, i think there's a bit of an artificiality in our saying it's more prevalent among the elderly, which is simply related to the objective reality, which is that it takes years for the accumulation in many cases to really reach that threshold of intolerance or impairment that's recognized by the individual."
2021,2021_309.txt,0,0.5794621109962463,"okay, perfect. okay so now we're going to get into the more conversational part of our interview, and for this i'd like you to just begin by giving me a little bit of background about you in terms of how you encounter individuals with this disorder.","um, well i do research and i have two lines of research having to do with hoarding, one with community-based interventions for hoarding and there i don't actually talk to people who have hoarding themselves, i'm talking with some of the service providers, like a fire department guy or a street nurse or something like that, and they talk about patients. and we also collect data, so there's data about the cases, but it's quite impoverished because there's no person attached to it. the other line of my research has to do with psychological functioning in hoarding, and there we actually have people who identify as having problems with hoarding come into our research lab and we give them a diagnostic interview and a bunch of testing. i directly listen to the diagnostic interviews, so i hear--i don't conduct them but i supervise them, so i hear quite a lot of stories from these recordings. and finally i supervise a INAUDIBLE doing group INAUDIBLE for hoarding. and so we usually have less than 6 clients per year and two students, probably like 2 more that don't work out for the group, and i watch all of those sessions, but i also attend home visits. i get to know the clients personally, that way INAUDIBLE. i also have treated hoarding individually, but i just don't have time to do that all of the time."

2021,2021_309.txt,0,0.287471741437912,interesting.,"so some people have a lot of space and some people don't have that much space, but people make choices in relation to that space and i think people who hoard are not making those choices."

2021,2021_310.txt,0,0.5028640627861023,"okay, so it's not a sudden influx of items, it's a slow acquisition.","yeah, yeah. every once in a while i'll hear about somebody who inherited stuff, you know. we had to clean out mom's house and i didn't know what to do with it so everything's here. every once in a while i hear something like that, but often i think that it's that they're just not noticing until there's some kind of tipping point. that the space to maneuver has gotten littler and littler and the amount of space they have to sit on the sofa has gotten smaller and smaller."
2021,2021_311.txt,0,0.5895142555236816,can you think of a case or cases that you thought was really challenging to diagnose or challenging to determine if the person truly had hoarding disorder or not and could you describe an instance like that for me?,"yeah, i can tell you about a case from last week. so this was a young woman, maybe in her 30s, she had moved into her apartment maybe only 8 months earlier, so she hadn't lived there very long. it's a very small apartment, her kitchen and living room were kind of all together like in one area, and her bedroom was a separate room, and the photos of the kitchen itself, like the place where you would prepare food and store things did not look hoarded at all. it looked extremely functional in the kitchen, but once you stepped away from the counters, there were piles of things that were more disorganized, but she described the things as not being hers or being temporarily there. like for example, there were some closet doors that she said belonged to the landlord. and i have a hard time knowing when somebody says that, that this object is temporarily there it just belongs to someone else, i have a hard time knowing how to evaluate that in the context of hoarding because people tell themselves stories about objects in their homes. about, oh yes this belongs to someone else, and they kind of...the fact that is has sat there for a while and it's actually going to sit there for the next five years is not part of the story that they tell themselves. so, i don't quite know how to evaluate it. the most problematic room was her bedroom, however, where the mattress was on the floor and there was no visible floor space in the entire length of the room and she described this situation as being due to the fact that in the previous apartment, her bed had been a loft and she hadn't yet been able to get a bed up on a loft because it takes 3 people to handle the loft. and that under the bed, once the loft was there, would be perfect storage space for all this stuff that was in her bedroom. the things in her bedroom included bikes and quite a large pile of pillows that was not actually on her bed, and the photos made it clear that she actually sleeps on a tiny part of the bed because the rest of the bed is covered with stuff. and so it, partly because the photo was of a bed on the floor, so like if your bed is up, like my bed is a couple feet above the floor, that means that if my possessions were at the height of the bed, that would be two and a half feet of debris. but her bed was on the floor, so it made it look a little fuller than it was. but it's still true that you couldn't walk in it, and she said she couldn't walk over to the other side of the bedroom, so i have a really hard time trying to sort out, especially because different areas of the home had different functional abilities. like the bedroom looked pretty not functional, the kitchen looked perfectly functional. so yeah, that was a hard one for me."
2021,2021_312.txt,0,0.6450437307357788,"it seems like there were a bunch of different components. so part of it was that the apartment, some part seemed usable and some parts seemed less usable and it was difficult to evaluate how long the situation was gonna stay like that. so maybe that would've been acceptable if her apartment was gonna stay in that condition for a little while, but if that was a permanent state it might be evaluated differently. and then also because her bed wasn't typically arranged the way a typical bed would, it sounds like it also made it more difficult to evaluate like how much there really was in these photographs. does that sound right?","i think that's right, that's right. and also because we weren't physically in the room, we couldn't...it didn't look like there was a lot in the closets, but i've also seen that in hoarded homes. like where everything is in the middle of the room and the closets are empty LAUGHS. and so yeah i had a really hard time sorting that. oh and she also said that--she described a hallway in which there was a washer, a dryer, and a desk and we didn't have photos of this part, but she said her landlord had come by to let her boyfriend into the apartment and he'd seen the hallway and he'd said to her, ""this needs to be cleaned up."" like apparently it was really overflowing with laundry and things like that and so that made me think oh there's pressure, like obviously that hallway looks quite full. but then she said that the landlord had told her, ""you know, whenever you'd like me to come back, whenever you feel ready for me to come back and have a look that it's cleaned up you just let me know."" so that means that he didn't think it was urgent, like really freak out, but clearly he thought something was not right in there."
2021,2021_312.txt,0,0.2993593215942383,"so that was kind of your way of imagining what somebody who was outside this home would think of the home, and from that you typed up that it was unusual but maybe not truly alarming.","yeah, exactly, yeah."
2021,2021_312.txt,0,0.3694407343864441,and so how did you end up making the decision? what decision did you end up coming to?,"we ended up, or i ended up deciding that she didn't meet criteria for hoarding because i felt like her home was too functional, but i also didn't put her in the healthy control group because she had too much hoarding for me to feel like she was clearly in either group. so we have a category that we call sub-clinical, where we see if the person's endorsing all the right mental state around their objects. there's just not quite enough impairment, so i put her in that category."
2021,2021_313.txt,0,0.45988401770591736,do you see very many people who fall in that category of sub-clinical?,"you know, we would see more but we try to screen them out and we use photographs in our telephone screening. i think what gets in the way is the questions that you would ask to evaluate whether someone has difficulties discarding things that other people might part with. that kind of question for a person who doesn't know anything about hoarding, they may say yes if they have just a strong attachment to things or if they've always been the kind of person who's a bit messy or if maybe they have a family member who's a minimalist, so they have some kind of conflict about it. but they're not actually anywhere close to hoarding, they'll say yes to all of those mental state questions."
2021,2021_313.txt,0,0.3776906430721283,because they don't really have a context for what an abnormal response would look like.,"exactly, exactly. and then when we look at the photos of their home we go, ""oh, right."" you know like had one woman who said, ""oh gosh, my bedroom is barely functional, you know sometimes i walk across the room and i trip on my shoes."" and we looked at her bedroom and actually yeah there was a pair of shoes on the floor, but that doesn't mean hoarding. it's just a bit of a messy person."
2021,2021_313.txt,0,0.665827214717865,"mhm, i can totally understand that too, having...you know, it's interesting to do these interviews because when you don't--when i started out doing them i didn't know anything really about hoarding disorder and reading the diagnostic criteria i was like, ""well this is so vague,"" but when you talk to experts they're like, ""it's honestly really not difficult to tell."" you know like it's not vague at all, but it's interesting too because it does seem to be a little bit of a gestalt, almost like a you just know it when you see it kind of a thing, rather than there being a clear yes or no boundary.","it is hard to describe, i would say it's like the concept of a INAUDIBLE set, there are hoarded homes that are clearly hoarded, they pretty much all look alike. but there are a lot of cases that kind of fall in the middle that are difficult, and it might be because there's somebody else in the home who is keeping a lid on things."
2021,2021_314.txt,0,0.584194004535675,"i mean, it's unusual as a disorder--and we're gonna talk about this in just a minute, so maybe i'll hold off on that comment. before i ask you that, do you find that it's difficult to make the distinction between hoarding disorder and other mental health disorders that might result in accumulating items? so depression, you know being too depressed to really clean up after yourself or being obsessive compulsive and having fears related to throwing things away. do you find that that's a difficult distinction to make?","i would say it's not a difficult distinction in my research or in our treatment program, i don't find that to be difficult at all. but i do think it could be difficult in the community setting, because the community let's say is having providers or something like that, they're not really making diagnosis and i'll bear with them in oh there's unsafe conditions here, and being able to figure out what's the appropriate intervention, it differs if it's unsafe because the person is so depressed they can't clean up after themselves. or if it's unsafe because the person is trying to run bicycle track shop to feed their drug addiction. you know, it's different intervention. like i think sometimes those are harder, probably wouldn't be very hard if it was a clinician making the judgement, but they're not. they're people from different backgrounds and training and it is hard for them."
2021,2021_314.txt,0,0.3644567131996155,"and it's not difficult for you as a clinician because you find it very easy to kind of talk to a person for a little while and figure out on the basis of their motivation for saving, why they're--which disorder they have?","yeah, and also what they're saving."
2021,2021_314.txt,0,0.27989986538887024,how so?,"you know because it--well, i come across people who are very poor and they're saving things to sell and they're not saving the same kinds of things. and actually they actually do sell them, unlike someone with hoarding who might say, ""oh i intend to sell them"" but nothing ever proceeds. and also i think the presence of, so in cases where i've seen where i thought this is really depression, it isn't hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. you know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a INAUDIBLE and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row. so it doesn't look like intentionally saved containers, like somebody might wash out their containers and might have 150 of them. but they're not just discarded with the food still in them right by the bed."
2021,2021_314.txt,0,0.3316623866558075,"so you can kind of see that the person hasn't necessarily decided to save them, they've just fallen where they fall.",exactly.
2021,2021_314.txt,0,0.7157135009765625,"now we're gonna talk a little bit more through the diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder, and before i start to ask specific questions about those criteria, do you have any thoughts as to part of the criteria that you have found difficult to apply or that you have thought different clinicians might apply differently or that rely on clinical judgement?","i think one of the challenges i have in training graduate students to diagnose hoarding, one of the difficulties i have is that they sometimes get so distracted by the psychological aspects of the diagnostic criteria, that they forget there's got to be a hoard."
2021,2021_315.txt,0,0.31125423312187195,"okay, can you explain what you mean?","i mean the person can say, ""oh yes i have great difficulty discarding, yes i acquire a lot"" and on why they intend to save these things, ""oh getting rid of them would be very upsetting to me"" but if there is no hoard, if there is no accumulation of possessions but if it's severe enough that we want to apply the word ""disorder"" to it, then we don't have a diagnosis. when you ask people about their impairment, if they don't have hoarding but they have too much stuff they will endorse impairment. it just dines't meet my threshold for impairment. like if you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning off your dining table before you can sit down and eat, that doesn't count as hoarding to me."
2021,2021_315.txt,0,0.5371444821357727,"well so that's kind of the cracks of the issue for me, is that i at least am very hard pressed to think of another disorder that requires external objects to be said to exist. you know like, it's been like a mystery for me in doing these interviews like how do you diagnose something that essentially you have to say exists in the person's mind, but you can only diagnose it if they have totally external items in sufficient quantities. you know like you would never diagnose like diabetes or hypertension or something based on how much ice cream or sugar that person has got their hands on, and if--","no, but i don't thin that's the right way to think about it. i think that by looking at the person's home, it like gives you a measurement. so it's more like getting a person suspected of an eating disorder to stand on a scale. and if they're not underweight, it doesn't matter how much they say yes they're afraid of getting fat and they restrict their eating. if they're not underweight, they're not anorexic."
2021,2021_315.txt,0,0.6088143587112427,"i think that that's an interesting analogy. the other strange part about hoarding disorder that we'll talk about a little bit more, at least for me, is the criteria of distress because often people with hoarding disorder will not endorse distress. they'll say, ""i'm totally happy with the situation as it is"" and they might even deny that they would be distressed if they had to throw items away. but even then it would be hypothetical distress, but they might even deny that. whereas as you mentioned, sometimes people who don't meet criteria for hoarding disorder will say they're distressed but the clinician has to say that's not true distress somehow. so you have again the situation where one person is saying, ""i'm not distressed"" and we're saying, ""oh yes you are."" you know what i mean? like i wonder how you asses distress in the context of hoarding.",well isn't the criteria distress or impairment?
2021,2021_316.txt,0,0.25023820996284485,yes.,"because for people who hoard, i see that as being similar to anorexia, bulimia, alcohol use disorder. there are a few disorders like that where the person might not be distressed, but an outside person can see there's obvious impairment here. it might be true even for attention problems, like attention deficit problems, so for the person who actually has hoarding disorder and they're saying, ""i'm not distressed"", that to me, because the criteria really is distress or impairment, and you can see these other disorders where they're egosyntonic, really. i don't have trouble with that one, i do have trouble with the other thing you mentioned, which is...so wait a minute, you're saying you're distressed and i'm saying not. i think that, i guess for me though...like the eating disorders, where you have to have all of the criteria or you don't get the diagnosis, in hoarding you have to have all of the criteria. and so if the person says ""i'm distressed,"" i almost say, ""well you're not distressed enough if i don't see a hoard."""
2021,2021_316.txt,0,0.5620266795158386,"so there's also this question in the diagnostic criteria, one of the criteria anyway reads, ""persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value."" and i'm wondering, is it a requirement that some of the possessions in the hoard to be a hoard are not objectively valuable or that there's a determination of inappropriate valuation at some point. so either they're objectively worthless and the person thinks they're worth money, or there's things that the person is sentimentally attached to that it just doesn't kind of make sense to be so sentimentally attached to those particular items? i guess the reason that i'm asking this is that i read this really interesting article this morning about a couple who their home appeared to be totally hoarded out, they couldn't have people over, it was totally filled to the brim, but then they were found to actually be in the possession of a very valuable art collection, which they donated and was valued at millions of dollars. i mean it made their apartment totally non-functional for a decade, but when somebody actually went through the items, they found that they were excessively, they were actually really valuable works of art. and yes they were impairing the couple's use of the home, but it was appropriate for them to be saved because they were so valuable. would that count as hoarding disorder? is there an element of either lack of value in the objects or indiscriminateness in the saving? does that make sense?","yeah, so the way i...i agree that that wording could be improved for sure. but when i see that criteria in driving that is this idea that nobody would just throw away their possessions indiscriminately, yet we would all get rid of some items. you know, the chopsticks that came with my sushi last night, i'm not gonna keep them because i have too many chopsticks already. and i think that the regardless of their, i forget how you said it was worded."
2021,2021_317.txt,0,0.35890695452690125,"actual value, yeah.","yeah, regardless of their actual value, i think that they attempt to try to say things that other people would get rid of. but when you use that language to ask inner beauty, many of them would say, ""i don't know what other people look at."" LAUGHS so that's not good language, you can't use that one. but that's the way i see it, is in effort to say do you keep stuff that other people would get rid of? and i see that as thinking and being responsive to your space. like do you keep stuff that other people would say, ""i'd rather have this space than this object in my life."" and in terms of the paintings, how i would view that would depend on what else is in the home. like if the paintings were the only thing in the home that was making someone think, ""oh, this is hoarding"" then i might think it doesn't sound like hoarding to me."
2021,2021_317.txt,0,0.5082974433898926,and is that because the person was only saving one sort of thing?,well that would make it certainly atypical for hoarding for sure. but also it would make it look more like a collection to me than hoarding.
2021,2021_317.txt,0,0.7196106910705566,"okay, and just to kind of get myself clear, can you have a collection that takes up so much room in your house that you can't use the house? i mean, or could you hoard, i guess i'm still struggling with that distinction. like if i had a toothpaste cap collection, and it filled my entire bathroom so i couldn't even wash my hands, how would i know if i had a collection or a hoard?","yeah, i think that's a really good thing to be confused about. it's also one of those things where there's this unspoken kind of social norms at play. toothpaste caps are not commonly accepted as a collectible, art is. even weird little things like things that have ducks on them, are recognized. it might not be something that i would want to collect, but people collect them. and hoarding involves a collection of things that don't, like i could see a guy who collected these age-old vitamin bottles because...i mean they were empty, he had eaten the vitamins out of them, but they don't make them the same way anymore. they've changed the style of bottle for this vitamin, so he saw that as a collection but i didn't see that as a collection. and INAUDIBLE why not LAUGHS, that's where i kind of in depth thinking well because society doesn't say it's a collection."
2021,2021_317.txt,0,0.5221778154373169,it's not a collectible.,"yeah, a collectible or something that someone would say, ""oh an expression of my personality is in this collection, you know because i love ducks."" or this is an investment of mine, i've become an expert on this thing, i'm now an art expert and i now have a good eye for this particular kind of thing. and those sort of statements you can't really apply to toothpaste caps or vitamin bottles."
2021,2021_317.txt,0,0.6557424068450928,so you couldn't be a vitamin bottle connoisseur.,"LAUGHS yeah, yeah and it would be different if he had a collection of different kinds of vitamin bottles, you know like different kind of bottles like you might see in an antique shop. but this was all one kind of vitamin bottle."
2021,2021_318.txt,0,0.5564777851104736,"and how do you make that determination about value when somebody is saying to you something about the sentimental value of an item? how do you determine if it's an appropriate or inappropriate sentimental valuation? so you know, somebody saying i can't throw away this box of baby clothes because my daughter wore them when she was a baby. is that a matter of sort of extent?","for me, that's why i come back to being responsive to the space available. so a person who is living in a big house where they raised their children, it's not uncommon for people to have an area of the basement that has their kid's possessions, they might want it someday. but if it's interfering with their living space, most people...very few people keep every single thing their baby ever touched. there's some decisions along the way of stuff you gotta get rid of, and so where you draw the line seems to me to be around the space you have available."
2021,2021_318.txt,0,0.6262674331665039,"one of the other criteria reads, ""the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter living areas and substantially compromises their intended use."" and i'm thinking about, for example the example that you gave earlier of the woman who had her countertops totally clear and thus was not compromising the intended use of her kitchen, but what if i gave you a counter example where her clutter extended to the countertops but she said, ""i don't know how to cook and i don't have any cooking supplies, and so this is how i want to use my kitchen counters because i'll never use them for cooking."" how do you determine that kind of intended use? i mean you could again extend that example outward and say, ""i don't have any guests, so why do i need a guest room? i only shower so i don't need a bathtub."" you know, you could extend out to the point of absurdity, but how do you draw the line on a patient by patient basis?","right, yeah so i think that's a really good question you're making and it sounds like you're implicitly noting that people will make accommodations in their lives and then use the fact that they've made an accommodation to the symptom as a kind of a rationalization. like this isn't really that big of a problem because i don't paint it big. and i would say that if i see one example of something like that in the home, where the person is saying, ""well i don't really cook so it doesn't matter that my stove is covered in stuff"" if that was all i saw was just the one example, i might go, ""okay,""but usually we see many more examples. that's what i would be looking for and i think that's one of the things that troubles me about that case that i gave you, is that i only really see the bedroom being impairment, and so that troubles me."
2021,2021_319.txt,0,0.46939903497695923,"because you would look for multiple ways that the space was being compromised by the items and just one might not be enough but you'd want to look and see is the amount of stuff really impairing the person's use of their home beyond this single example, and is it extended to multiple examples.","that's right, and also i would be looking to satisfy myself if, are they telling me a story about who they are as a person and that's real and that would be true even if they didn't have stuff, or are they telling me a story of how they've accommodated to their symptoms?"
2021,2021_319.txt,0,0.3709794282913208,"i guess that you could ask that same question in kind of a larger way about this disorder. i mean, do you feel that when somebody tells you, ""i'm saving this item because i might use it someday or i'm afraid to waste it,"" do you feel like they're justifying the fact that they have already decided to save it? like is the symptom ""i have to save things"" and then they come up with reasons sort of post-hoc to justify that behavior? or do you feel like it's the reasoning that's driving the saving behavior? does that make sense as a question?","that's a good question, i don't know the answer to that...i really don't."
2021,2021_319.txt,0,0.6510257720947266,"it's something that i wonder a lot about with hoarding symptoms because the answers--the reasons that people give for why they're saving are so uniform, it really makes me wonder are these just the reasons that we as a society have decided it's appropriate to save, so when somebody is compulsively saving are they just reciting the reasons that that might be okay, or are their reasons more psychological and more cognitive and more driving? you know is it more similar to an obsessive-compulsive disorder where they're really worried about memory and poverty and things they might need?","yeah, i can think of it around kind of being a good person, and a good person is prepared for emergencies and a good person is true to their artistic selves and a good person doesn't waste things. and whichever one of those reason for saving kind of talks to their sense of ""i'm a good person."" i'm hesitant to totally disregard that as a rationalization of the behavior, but it certainly looks like that and smells like that at times but i just don't really know."

2021,2021_320.txt,0,0.6913180351257324,"kind of to follow that up, different individuals--so one of the reasons i found your initial response to my question about how you can tell hoarding disorder to be so interesting, is that different people might like to have different amounts of stuff around them. so, i might like to have a totally clear desk, whereas my sister might really prefer a desk that's cluttered and she might say something like, ""well i think better when there are more items around me."" and i wonder if you ever think of hoarding disorder as being an extension of that sort of concept, or maybe less about the individual items and more about the relationship between a person and objects in space. so, i like to be more enclosed, or they like to have a busier...i think the word they used is chaotic, you know they like to have things that they can look at and see everywhere around them; rather than somebody who prefers simplicity in their space.","yeah, i think there's something to that. i don't know, however, how much of that is familiarity because hoarding is not an episodic problem and it didn't develop yesterday in the person. so, that's kind of in part what i was also meaning about the slow creep of the hoard, but their home has come to look and feel in a certain way. we have a hoarded room in my lab, and it really does look like a hoarded room, and there's a different smell about that room. there's no squalor in the room but there's kind of that dusty cardboard sort of smell and if that's the smell that you've come to associate with the home, then that would be a comforting smell. and there's also a different acoustic in that room than in the room next door, which is perfectly empty. and if that's the acoustic that you've come to associate with home, then that's gonna be appealing to you and having a lot less stuff in it is going to feel weird."
2021,2021_320.txt,0,0.47705766558647156,"so it's hard to tell whether it's just that you're accustomed to your space being that way, versus if that's really what you're trying to accomplish by making our space that way.","yeah, and i think that's part of what's relevant about having hoarding in your family, that if you grew up in a hoarded home then you've always had this kind of aesthetic around the home in terms of what the walls look like and what it sounds like and what is smells like."
2021,2021_320.txt,0,0.4215150773525238,"mhhm, kind of speaking to the point that you've made about the creep of the hoard, a lot of the literature around hoarding suggests that patients with this disorder are older, although that might not be where it always starts. do you have a sense with your patients how long it's been going on when they come to see you?",decades.
2021,2021_321.txt,0,0.64998859167099,"and i guess my question is, do you view hoarding as a disorder that is progressive in a sense of getting worse with age, like the behavior intensifies as a person ages? or do you think that the reason older people tend to have it is more related to them needing time to have accumulated that much stuff? you know, them being maybe in a social place in their lives where older people are going to be more isolated, their children have left, you know maybe left their stuff at home, they're more likely to be in a stable living space for a longer period of time rather than moving to new apartments every couple of years. or even it's just getting picked up at that stage because they are less mobile. i guess what i'm asking is do you think it's progressive? do you think it worsens with age, maybe do to cognitive issues or do you think that it's mostly a side effect? that it happens to be seen mostly with older people for more kind of lifestyle or social reasons?","i think it's both. i think that all of the reasons that you listed about why it might be more evident in older people, all of those ring true and i would say maybe up until early older adulthood that would be the primary driver. maybe add to that list deceased parents, so now you have the extra stuff that you don't know what to do with, and then i think that there probably is a progressive, even if there's not like cognitive decline, there's physical decline. and so, you get a new printer, what do you do with the old one? well it's harder to do stuff like that when you're 75 than if you're 35."

2021,2021_321.txt,0,0.533542811870575,"that's interesting, i would like to know the answer to that. that's a good way of figuring that out. like maybe they've been more intentional and then at a certain point they've just stopped discarding because it's harder and that would be a way you could figure that out.","yeah, exactly. yeah because people do stop acquiring in some point in life, like you get everything you need so you're not acquiring these things intentionally like just to add to, like ""oh geez i could use a INAUDIBLE or whatever"" LAUGHS."
2021,2021_321.txt,0,0.4343196749687195,so you think that maybe the intentional acquiring like shopping acquiring stops at a certain point or slows down and then it becomes more passive.,"yeah i think it probably slows, yeah. you'll still need a new printer every once in a while, but you wouldn't necessarily upgrade."

2021,2021_323.txt,0,0.6326326131820679,"so insight isn't related necessarily to the desire for treatment or the desire to change their behavior, insight is simply the ability to know that their behavior departs from the norm. and then separate form that is the desire to fix the behavior or to make their home different, to discard, all that is not insight, it's more like willingness for treatment.","yeah, i would agree with all of that except for the parting with the norm, in that my partner, for example, will often stay up very late working, and she knows it's bad for her. she knows that if she's been working on the computer she's not going to sleep well that night, she knows that her work is slower at 2 in the morning, but she persists in doing it. so she doesn't actually have a desire to change, but she has excellent insight about the consequences of this behavior. so i wouldn't say deviations from the norm, so much as i would say they can realistically evaluate the consequences."

2022,2022_326.txt,0,0.7429727911949158,"okay, so for the first portion of the interview we're going to be talking about the ways that clinicians identify patients with hoarding disorder. and just to begin i'd like to ask you, for you what are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps collecting or any kind of normal saving, and hoarding disorder? is it a spectrum? are there clear delineators and if so, what are they?","i see clear differentiation between concepts like collecting and hoarding, or someone who is just a bit untidy, if you will, versus someone who has hoarding behavior if not meeting diagnostic criteria, and for me there's a couple of pieces there. one is certainly about the volume of possessions, but that's only important in the context of the ability to carry out daily life activities. so i think you cross the line when you've got interference in carrying out adls and that accompanied by these strong beliefs and emotions certainly sets someone who is collecting or someone who is a bit untidy apart from someone with hoarding behavior. so i think pure physical manifestation is dangerous, i think we can't make an assessment based on that alone, especially when we're talking about diagnostic levels of hoarding. i think you have to consider those other features as well."
2022,2022_326.txt,0,0.7997016906738281,can you think of an example of a case that was challenging for you to diagnose or that you felt was borderline or was an interesting sort of challenge to decide if it indeed constituted hoarding disorder or not? have you ever encountered a case like that?,"yeah, you know so it was not a question of--it was a differential diagnosis, the most interesting case but maybe that's a different question. are you asking me only about did i know if it was hoarding or not hoarding? or hoarding vs something else?"
2022,2022_327.txt,0,0.7200005054473877,"yeah, so another problem that you might've encountered is distinguishing hoarding disorder from often comorbid and related disorders, like depression or ocd.","yeah, yeah, i think the cases of hoarding if i have the kind of clinical information that i was just telling you about, i don't feel like i've struggled very much in those domains. but sometimes i'm called by a community organization and they describe a dwelling to me and i haven't had the opportunity to talk to the person or conduct clinical assessments, i find those nearly impossible because i refuse to sort of say something just based on the volume of possessions alone, but i think the more difficult clinical decisions for me have been differential diagnostic decisions and i can think immediately of one case where there was the saving of rather bizarre items, and i was differentially trying to diagnose whether the hoarding was secondary to ocd or whether hoarding was primary and there were two primary co-occurring conditions. it was very tricky, i think the number of cases where we have hoarding in the context of ocd and kind of bizarre saving are limited. you know, they don't number many overall, so i find those very tricky to figure out what the driver is, what the obsessions and compulsions are. the other situation that i currently am working in and is of great interest to me from a research perspective, but having to do with diagnostics is hoarding in cases of severe substance abuse. so, in downtown east side of vancouver, in the single room occupancy, sro housing, there's a very very high drug-use rate, opioids largely and hoarding in sros is overwhelming, this portion of the city and it's very tricky to figure out if the hoarding is secondary to the substance abuse, if it is a more primal sort of animal kind of instinct hoarding, you know the nesting kind of hoarding that stephanie preston has written about, or whether it's primary hoarding. and if it is primary hoarding, is it for, you know, for a means to an end of living because these people are in such obvious poverty. so, those conditions where it's not only a co-occurring other diagnostic problem like substance abuse, but the social elements of life i think really complicate diagnosis sometimes."
2022,2022_327.txt,0,0.45414087176322937,"so when you say social elements of life, you mean, for instance, poverty and worry about not having enough to eat later so therefore saving things now, that sort of thing.","yeah, more particularly i'm thinking of it's very common for people from sros to save things for their chop shops and so it's very hard in a room to know if what's being saved is actually, there's attachment to it and/or if it's a means to a way of life. and if the person is using substances, making that assessment is next to impossible actually."
2022,2022_328.txt,0,0.6049482226371765,"we're gonna talk a little bit more about that later. in fact, the next section of the interview we're gonna talk a little bit about the specific dsm-v criteria, and as i move into that section of the interview, i wonder if at the outside there are particular elements of the dsm-v criteria that you think might be particularly difficult to apply or that you've thought on clinical judgement they might be applied differently by different clinicians in different places. does anything spring to mind about the criteria off the top of your head?","i was working really closely with NAME when the criteria was developed for field trial actually. so, the first thing that comes to mind, which has been a longstanding conversation, is the distress or impairment in functioning criteria, so that ""or"" is an interesting one there. and of course reflects the egosyntonic vs egodystonic nature of hoarding and all of the controversy that kind of comes up around that, and i think in some ways we put that discussion to bed, but in other ways i think it's really still quite a central question. not so much is a disorder a disorder if it is egosyntonic, but what does it mean when it is egosyntonic in terms of things like insight and motivation for treatment? so that's one piece, i think another piece that's really interesting to me, and has been since the time of sort of looking at that criteria, is acquisition as a specifier and i'm thinking more broadly about the relationship to compulsive buying sort of the works that NAME is doing and the models of compulsive buying and how we understand. certainly buying is only one form of acquisition, but what the interrelationship is between those two things, especially given the impulse-control problem that is inherent in acquisition that is different in other elements of hoarding behavior. we don't see quite that same impulse-control problem, or at least manifesting in the same way. and then the third thing that i would say is this differential piece between, that the hoarding is better accounted for by other medical or mental health, you know physical or mental health problems and i think, you know, dementia is a whole place, brain injury is a whole place where actually doing the differential diagnosis to understand what the driver is is really complicated, and i don't think the structured energy for hoarding disorder as it currently stands or any of our other assessments, they weren't developed to help us make those differentials. so, i think we're really locked, i think, in those domains."
2022,2022_329.txt,0,0.756736159324646,"many of that we're gonna talk about more in just a minute. i'm gonna move through the criteria now and read you a phrase, and then we'll talk about the issues kind of as they come up. and, you know, i just want to hear as i read you the phrase what you think about when you apply this particular part of the criteria. the first part is persistent difficult discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value, and that really reminds me of the conversation we just had about how you determine actual value when you're in a, for instance, the example you gave where things are being sold to a chop shop and everybody is kind of scrambling for small amounts of money. so, what, how do you go about deciding if an item is valuable or not in that context and whether there is kind of inappropriate attachment versus appropriate attachment?","yeah, that's a very complicated question depending on who you ask, right, you get a very different answer. so my objective assessment, or seemingly objective assessment, is not objective at all of course because i'm influenced by my own cultural elements and all of those things play into this, right, so depending on who's making that assessment about the value of objects and certainly if you talk to the person who's doing the saving and the hoarding of those objects, they often are not of limited value and the monetary or market value is one value and it seems to be, in some ways, the implicit value that we assign as part of the diagnostic criteria. so i think other values are considered, but probably not equally so yeah, i think that phrase is really dependent on who's doing the assessment."
2022,2022_329.txt,0,0.5137032866477966,"and i guess what i'm wondering also is is the kind of lack of value or lack of selectivity a central component of hoarding disorder? i mean, can you hoard all of only one item? can your house be full of cuckoo clocks and you have hoarding disorder? or is the disorder necessary for the disorder? does that make sense?","yeah, well i don't, i would say that if the number of whatever the one object is is causing interference and it meets the rest of the criteria, probably i would say one item is sufficient, though it would be hard to imagine how the rest of the criteria would be met with that."
2022,2022_330.txt,0,0.4769500494003296,"another really interesting example that i read about is an example of a couple, and maybe you've heard of this it's a pretty famous story, they lived in a very small apartment in new york city, which was entirely filled up with objects to the point that they couldn't use the space, they couldn't host people, they couldn't sit down in their own apartment. it just so happened that it was an art collection, and when they died it was an extremely valuable art collection that they had accumulated over the course of like 60 years of living in new york city and it was all donated to the met and valued at like $6 million, but prior to them dying nobody was able to view the art, nobody was able to enter the apartment, it was basically an unlivable space. and i guess the question i have is does that count as hoarding disorder if they're hoarding appropriately valuable items in a small space that they can no longer use as an apartment?","yeah, it's a very interesting question because in a way it doesn't meet that criteria of value. but for me, i guess what i'm articulating a lot here is my own weighting of those criteria, so that if it's causing interference in the ability to use their space for the purpose intended, regardless of the actual value, that other criteria weighs a bit heavier for me probably than the actual value. i find that a more subjective criteria in lots of ways."
2022,2022_331.txt,0,0.7735310792922974,"so, this criteria you're talking about, the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use, i guess i'm wondering...well two things. first of all, you gave the example of a supplemental housing situation where they only have one room, and i'm wondering how you make an assessment of hoarding disorder when people can occupy such different amounts of space. so, if you owned a mansion and were very very rich and could afford kind of infinite storage units, such that your space was never compromised, would you ever have hoarding disorder? would you ever meet criteria for hoarding disorder? versus somebody who is living in a one bedroom apartment where the amount of stuff they have, you know, you could have a very normal amount of stuff but if you don't have any space, your space will be congested. so, how do you take that into account and do you take that into account? would a person who has a mansion ever have hoarding disorder if they couldn't fill up their mansion?","you know, for me the answer is yes and i've had the opportunity to treat a number of people over the years who have sort of unlimited resources and a woman in massachusetts comes right to mind. she lived in a over 6,0000 square foot home, she had a full staff of people, and while all of that was true and she had a team of people who were literally helping her manage the accumulation of possessions so that the physical interference was somewhat kept at bay, the other elements that we've been talking about, that is the attachment to the objects through the strong beliefs and the emotions, the kind of avoidance behaviors, all of that was deeply intact and interfering in her ability to live as she wished to be living. so this was a woman who, for example, couldn't let any water run down the drain without...she had to save in the sink or in the shower, she collected all of that water and stored it and repurposed it. and so you can see the sort of ideas there and the interference in her ability to sort of live in a normal, whatever that means, way even though the clutter was being managed, the same ideas were also the wastefulness and being in control and these perfectionistic ideas generalized from clothing and books to water in this case. so i think space is, yes it's certainly made complicated by the fact that someone who moved from 2300 square feet to 900 square feet now has to manage their hoarding, but we know that those things are not causal in any way. so, the space alone is not causal but makes diagnosis certainly more complicated, assessment diagnosis more complicated. it doesn't necessarily make intervention more complicated, once you have clearly decided what it is, then you can kind of go forward from there."
2022,2022_332.txt,0,0.6439281105995178,"another interesting diagnostic example that clinicians offered when we were talking about this criteria, and i'd love to hear what you think of this, is a patient that they treated who hoarded digital media so that their objects actually took up very little physical space, but the patient was incapable of ever deleting an email that they ever received or saved all of their browser history and was accumulating slowly hard drives filled with books on pdf and had tens of thousands of them and the physical space in their apartment actually was pretty small, but it was a similar sort of urge or a similar sort of distress with discarding and all of the justifications that the person gave for saving the digital media sounded like hoarding disorder. you know like, ""i'll read all of these books someday, i might need it sometime, i'm afraid i'll forget"" it didn't seem to sound like ocd but there were no physical objects in sight. so do you think that that would meet criteria for you?","um, you know it would be...i've had similar cases, perhaps even a bit more extreme where there were multiple screens and a person was kind of unable to, they had to constantly kind of monitor things and then back in the day of vhs tapes and those kinds of things, the accumulation of that kind of technology, vcrs and things which generally speaking does take up quite a lot less space. in the absence of saving other objects, i'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. for me, the times that i have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly. one case that i can think of, yeah so i don't think strictly it would been the criteria because it wouldn't meet that interference piece, but if it were in the context of other things, perhaps."
2022,2022_333.txt,0,0.665611207485199,"you mentioned the kind of like nesting or space kind of creation way of thinking about hoarding, and i mean there is a normal kind of degree of variance in the kinds of spaces that people like to inhabit. like some people might enjoy a very clear desk, other people might really like to have clutter on their desk and have them feel productive and you know, so i guess how do you think about hoarding disorder in that way? do you feel like its, that that kind of, that hoarding is a way of creating a comfortable space? do you see that in your patients? is that part of how you think about the use of space in hoarding disorder?","yeah, i suppose i see it more probably than even just space, i think. the sociologist in me thinks a lot about the idea of home and how people make home and how objects serve as one way for people to make home, but that there's a whole body of literature in sociology about being builders and the nesting piece that we talked about within hoarding is not far from this idea of the usefulness of objects for building, this construct in sociology, and sometimes building is related to making home but sometimes people just build for the sake of building. and i don't mean that in quite the literal--so just to state that it's a construct. and so yes, i see it quite broadly and i think that the continuum is a long one and that we don't fully understand all of the elements, all of the variables, if you will. for example, cultural or geographic region variations in how people use space or the idea of building or building homes, i think we haven't begun to tap into understanding those pieces."
2022,2022_333.txt,0,0.6619954705238342,"it is really amazing and cool that you bring that up. that's actually a project that i'm working on, i'm actually an anthropology student INAUDIBLE phd, so one of the things that i'm working on is a way of looking at what hoarding disorder can teach us about building homes. so, if that's interesting to you, i don't have anybody that i'm working with on this in anthropology or sociology, so if you wanna talk about that at any point i would love to have somebody to work with on that because it's just been a fun, interesting side project--cuz that's exactly what a lot of this made me think of when i started to encounter it, is what, how those two kinds of ideas or literatures are related. anyway, that's a side note.","yeah, feel free to contact me about that work. i'm in a collaboration with, i think you're also talking with my colleague she's NAME who's a clinical psychologist at INSTITUTION and we are in a collaborative partnership with a third person who's name is NAME and he is a sociologist where i choose to have my academic life and social work, he's in sociology and we're writing a paper right now with some of these concepts in them called, ""making room"" is our working title, but yeah i'd be delighted. there's not a lot of conversation about this, so anytime you'd like feel free to reach out."
2022,2022_334.txt,0,0.4672287702560425,"yeah, i'll follow up our conversation today with an email. we're actually gonna start, i told you at the beginning, we're gonna start talking to patients shortly and i'm actually building a whole section. so we have, this is totally off topic from the interview, but we have a partnership with NAME's lab and hopefully NAME's lab and they both have large kind of research studies going on in hoarding disorder, so a large body of patients who have already consented to do research and we're gonna be calling and doing interviews and asking them about home and what they think of when they think of home and how their space, how items contribute to the building of their home. so, if that would be something that you would like to help us to design, that's the stage that we're at--the design stage--and hopefully we'll be starting within the next couple of months with the patient interviews, so if that's interesting to you i would love to like really really truly deeply would love to have mentorship on that because it's something that i've been doing totally on my own.","yeah for sure, let's continue the conversation about it."
2022,2022_335.txt,0,0.8763211369514465,"sorry, so the last of the criteria that i'd like to talk through with you is about distress and it's gonna move us into a conversation about insight that you've kind of already foreshadowed, and the criteria reads, ""this difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them."" and so the question that i have is about how you're determining distress in this context? if a patient has very low insight and doesn't think that their hoarding is a problem, you know, denies that they are at all distressed and says they're perfectly happy with their space the way that it is, how is the distress kind of criteria met or if the person says they're not impaired, how do you determine what constitutes impairment?","yeah i think the distress question is slightly more difficult than the impairment question. i think often times it is the collateral context, the people around the person with hoarding that are the distress markers, if you will. so they are the family members or the housing inspector or the child welfare organization, are the markers of distress so they are the ones who are bothered by the saving and the manifestation of the objects, and sometimes in the face of that evidence in clinical interview i have been successful in having clients acknowledge at least why others might be distressed, even if they are not distressed. so they continue to deny their own, but are willing to say, ""yes i hear it from other people and i can see why they would be bothered and/or worried."" so that's one path that i take in clinical interview for assessment purposes of distress. i think the measures--and i would say that the measures that we have, the standardized measures, you know the hoarding rating scale or the saving inventory revise very little in these ways. they do more in the area of impairment if the person has some amount of insight, but we know that insight of course, or lack thereof, is part of the pathology of this problem. it's also fluctuating, right, so in any given moment a person may be able to say, ""yes this is deeply impairing and deeply distressing"" and in the very next moment they may deny both of those things, again as part of the illness. so i think both, for me clinically, both distress and impairment is part of my clinical interview more than, i come at those things through the clinical interview more than i use those standardized assessments. i don't think what we have available right now does a very good job."
2022,2022_336.txt,0,0.627194344997406,"i mean it's interesting for me as a--so, somebody who's not in this field at all--to think about hoarding disorder because in a sense it's unique in two respects. one is it's a disorder that you can't really diagnose from the patient's body or even from their, like an examination of their mind or their speech, it requires external objects to diagnose and i can't think of another disorder that requires something truly external to the patient to have. and then it's maybe not unique in disorders in that the insight problem exists for many psychiatric disorders, where people will deny that they have a problem, but i think this quality of the disorder is distressing to others is also a way that hoarding is weirdly kind of external to the patient themselves. that when clinicians in these interviews talk about distress, they often talk about other people's distress other than the patient's. the patient's spouse, the patient's family, or you know that kind of society at large is distressed, and the patient themselves is the one who is kind of being told that they fit this distress criteria, but often it's the distress of others that is driving them in or is what's really happening. and i don't know i guess i'm just trying to get your thoughts on that on why you think, in this particular case, insight is kind of a problem in that way or why it's having this kind of strange externalizing effect?","yeah, well i think wherever you have something that is egosyntonic, it's not surprising. true in other conditions, right, so if something feels consistent and right and good, even if there is...intrapsychically if it feels consistent and right and good, evidence from the external world then is what creates the dissonance or ambivalence at best, which then of course can be explored and enhanced, leading potentially to some motivational change. but i think the quality of the fact that these objects are often for people with hoarding where they have their primary relationship, they are where they spend most of their time, they are the source of their identity and good feelings about themselves, and so in the same way that we think about being in a relationship with another person who others might be able to judge from the outside and say, ""oh i wish you wouldn't hang out with that person, they're not good for her"" that person doesn't feel that distress. they enjoy that relationship, they enjoy that experience, they're getting whatever they're getting from that relationship and i think the relationship with the objects is very similar here."
2022,2022_336.txt,0,0.4538159668445587,"that's interesting, like having an abusive relationship with objects.",i'm sorry?
2022,2022_337.txt,0,0.4111880660057068,like having an abusive relationship with objects.,"yeah, yeah, certainly one that is not fully healthy or supporting the person from, in all domains yes. and the, i think the insight piece is tricky because there is to some degree in many people who hoard recognition that they are not like other people. if this weren't true, shame wound't be present. if that wasn't true, there wouldn't be worry about stigma or inviting people in or fear of negative consequences. so, i think this insight piece is worthy of enormous amounts of research and exploration because it is not, for most people, entirely absent. the insight into the impairment, the functional impairment or the negative consequences for self might be more diminished, but for most people that i've encountered clinically, now hundreds of people with hoarding, this idea that they're not like others seems to be present at lest to some greater or lesser extent. so, that part of insight is a little trickier for me. how do we help people who have some awareness that they're not like others actually use that to either be able to articulate the distress that they feel, or to move them toward being more motivated--intrinsically motivated--for treatment?"
2022,2022_337.txt,0,0.592272937297821,"mhhm, i mean it really is a very interesting problem, particularly with hoarding disorder, and i think you are exactly right as to why because they do realize that they're different, it's just that they don't see their differentness as a problem and in some cases, in many cases, they see it almost as being a good thing, a thing that is better about them than other people.","that's right, that other people just somehow don't understand the value of things in the way that they do, yep."
2022,2022_337.txt,0,0.30399826169013977,"and i mean, as a clinician it must be unusual to encounter people like that and to also at the same time see that they are exceptionally creative and that sometimes there's almost something cool about having a person who really sees value in objects and appreciates them in that way.","that's right, that's right yeah for sure."
2022,2022_338.txt,0,0.7322587370872498,"so there was this wonderful paper by randy frost about the concept of insight, which is really the big one that discusses it and breaks it down and he broke it down into four different constructs that one could talk about when one talks about insight, and i'm gonna read them to you. the first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia or kind of the lack of ability to perceive your illness or that something is wrong and causing you distress or reducing quality of life, the third is overvalued ideation, which is kind of the persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items which could be mild or could be delusional, and then the final one is indifference. and i wonder if you see all of these in your patients, if you see some of them as being more important than others or how you relate what you think of as insight or low insight to these different ideas of defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideation and indifference?","yeah, i think for me the first three i would say i see in equal distribution frequently, and sometimes overlapping. the indifference is...i see far less i would say, at least as i understand randy to have been talking about it, and i think i also would say about the first three that i see them as present at different levels and with fluctuation as i was saying earlier. so, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. and i remember when i first started to treat this problem as a young INAUDIBLE clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. it was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then i'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. and then sure as i got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know. so, yeah i think i could probably count on two hands the number of patients out of the hundreds that i've worked with where the indifference was very strong. i think it's a much more limited feature from my perspective."
2022,2022_338.txt,0,0.6481515169143677,"it's interesting to me because overvalued ideation certainly, and anosognosia perhaps to a lesser extent, almost sound like a psychosis or like an inability to perceive reality. like you look at an object and you truly believe that it's worth more than it is in a way that departs from reality, or you look at a space and you truly cannot see the space as it exists, and i wonder if that's a part of insight for you? if that kind of like break from reality and the ability to perceive reality, is that a big part for you? is that a small part?","i think it's a big part, though when i compare it to--i also do work in the area of animal hoarding--and when i compare those two to the sort of delusional, articulated, persistent delusional beliefs that we hear alongside animal hoarding, that makes the anosognosia and overvalued ideation look like nothing, quite honestly. it makes it look like mild."
2022,2022_339.txt,0,0.4746844172477722,i was just gonna follow up and ask you about animal hoarding.,"people who hoard animals have this very strong delusional belief, you know, they can be standing in four feet of feces among carcasses of animals and tell you that they're the only person to provide good care. and so i think it is on a continuum and when i think only about object hoarding, i would say that yes i would agree with you that it probably tends towards something less in touch with reality, though my clinical experience of it is i've never actually had to think in my mind, ""oh is this person not in touch with reality?"" what it is is such a deeply held belief, it is the definition of a core belief in my mind because it is just this belief that, ""because i own this pen, it is worth more than you will ever understand, it is worth more than any other pen like it in the store, it is because it is mine and it has been with me on this journey."" so, that's the flavor of it much more so than a dissociated reality, at least to my experience. sorry, one caveat though i would say is the saving of bizarre items that we see in the smaller percentage of hoarding that overlaps with ocd. sometimes that overvalued ideation takes a bit more of an out of touch feeling around the bizarre items, but i would say that's the exception and not the rule."
2022,2022_339.txt,0,0.7791768312454224,"and when you think about the reasons people give, which we made a list of at the beginning, the reasons that they save items. so, those may be related that core belief and maybe even including it, when you think about hoarding disorder, do you feel like the reasons you gave like it's sentimental, it might help me to not forget things, you know those sorts of reasons, do you feel like they are truly driving the disorder? or do you feel like they're kind of post-hoc justifications that the patient has for kind of an underlying essential biological need to save things, and then they just kind of...they save it, they need to save it, and then when you ask them why, they kind of generate a justification for it?","um...no, it is my belief that as an anxiety-based disorder that the saving that is happening and the justification for the saving is based in fear and worry, and it is the excessive fear and worry that leads to the thinking that is reinforced both with the accompanying strong emotion. so they have this fear and then all of the accompanying emotions alongside the fear about what will happen if i don't have this object, and what leads me to say that is when i hear these justifications from clients, it's often accompanied by a clear articulation of a very bad thing that would happen to them or to someone that they loved, ranging from some bodily harm to something akin to some kind of disaster. so, it feels to me not like a justification, it seems that it is this primal urge that is driven by fear and fear's powerful, right? and sometimes it's there for good reasons, but in other cases it is not justified, and i think that's where things get confused for people with hoarding."
2022,2022_340.txt,0,0.7063333988189697,"do you see, and this is of particular interest to me, but do you see kind of cultural values relating to the proper way to own items or dispose of them or maybe forces associating value and self-worth with ownership and material goods, do you see them as related? and maybe one example may be people who save things because they're worried about the environment. do you feel like those reasons that people give to save are reflections of those kinds of, maybe like larger ideas about the place of items in the world and the things that can happen with them? i don't know, that was a very vague question.","yeah no, i see them. certainly my social work and sociology training, i see them as intricately connected. i think, and again i think we haven't scratched the surface here, but i think it ranges from personal values and cultural elements across the cultural and societal levels. so, i sort of see that pcs model. i think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and i think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. i think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. i think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. one of the things that i'm, you know i remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding? would the phenomenon even have roots, because it couldn't manifest in the same ways? so, i think yeah i think there's a whole pile of questions and no answers in that category, but i certainly see culture and society as being deeply influential around this problem."
2022,2022_341.txt,0,0.5794583559036255,"and i want to be respectful of your time, so if you have to go at any point please just let me know, i'm pretty much at my last question. so, when you typically encounter hoarders, how long do they say that their behavior has been going on?","well...i mean the, i was part of the clinical trial, i was a study therapist on the INAUDIBLE trial, from which the data emerged that people begin saving and INAUDIBLE. and so i treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. i would say that's the vast majority of the people that i've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. and the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. i will say i've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. so, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. but most of the people, and i don't work primarily with older adults, i'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but i think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. you know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. and because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem. and so i think, unless they actually ask for help or come forwards, figuring out the progression of this is very tricky business."
2022,2022_342.txt,0,0.5426938533782959,"yeah, so that's kind of along the lines of what i was going to ask you about. how do you distinguish between chronically progressive and kind of the normal sort of social life events, which happen to many people? like your parents die and leave you a bunch of stuff, your children leave home and so you're now alone in the house, your marriage ends or your spouse dies and so you're more isolated? and do you as a clinician think that it's related to things like dementia, and therefore related to aging, and therefore that's why we see it as more prevalent in older adults? or do you see it as progressive in more of a kind of social sense in the sense that people tend to have more items and be more isolated as they age?","yeah, i think the demential piece is again an area that's really understudied and not well understood. i think anything that we have is, you know we have a few good studies but it's mostly hypothesis at this point. i think for me the normal life events against a back trap, again all of those vulnerabilities, against a back trap of those genetic predispositions for this and neurobiological features and factors that are brought to life means that certainly it can be present for a long time before it reaches the flashpoint, or it might be a slow...you know, the snowball rolling down the hill that gains this momentum and size as it goes. and i think we don't fully understand any of that yet, i think clinically the most important thing that we can do as part of our assessment is to take that decade by decade like history and really try to understand what were the best vulnerabilities for developing this problem. you know, if we can get approximate age of onset and then what does the chronicity look like and then what were the periods of worsening course, i think that would give us our best bet for hopefully someday earlier intervention and maybe prevention work, but we're such a long way from that."
2022,2022_342.txt,0,0.6388475894927979,can you hear me okay?,yes.
2022,2022_342.txt,0,0.683475911617279,"okay, that's the last little list we have for you, and now i'd like to get into the more kind of conversational portion of our interview. could you just begin by giving me a brief overview in terms of your background related to hoarding disorder?","sure, so for the past nine years, i have worked in a community agency doing individual group treatments for hoarding disorder. i also work in a care facility and am currently doing research and treatment and on creating an assessment to care planning method for hoarding disorder in care settings. i also work as a clinical social worker doing private practice, individual or family work with people with hoarding disorder."
2022,2022_342.txt,0,0.48772239685058594,"okay, and your educational background?",i have a master's in social work and a bachelor's in psychology.
2022,2022_342.txt,0,0.34043052792549133,"okay. okay, so the first thing i'd like to talk to you about in this interview is about how you distinguish hoarding disorder from other kind of behaviors that are more on the spectrum of normalcy and how you diagnose it? do you diagnose people with hoarding disorder clinically?",no.
2022,2022_343.txt,0,0.4011893570423126,"okay, i'm gonna start by asking you kind of broad questions, and then i'd like to ask you a little bit about the specific dns-iv criteria, although i know you don't necessarily use them in diagnosis, i assume you're really familiar with them. is that correct?",yeah.
2022,2022_343.txt,0,0.7062113285064697,"just to begin with as a broad first question, for you what are the most important differences between things that are on the spectrum of normal saving behavior, even thinking about something like extreme collecting, and hoarding disorder? how do you differentiate?","um, so it would be the...like the emotional attachment to the item, usually people that have just collecting behaviors don't feel that emotional connection to the object, they look at the object differently. so, generally when people want to get rid of something, if they don't have hoarding disorder they can get rid of it with little help or a little bit of time. people with hoarding disorder will get extreme amounts of anxiety when they think about or try to discard something. so, that's the biggest difference is the emotional attachment and the feelings regarding the item."
2022,2022_343.txt,0,0.4086908996105194,is there a different in terms of--,"and it's also--sorry. a lot of times it's not just one type of item. like with collectors, collectors will collect like certain things but people with hoarding disorder will usually, it'll be random items. so, it could be different types of items, not just one type."
2022,2022_343.txt,0,0.23809164762496948,"so, it sounds like individuals who are collectors will not have the same degree of emotional attachment and will not have the same kind of emotional reaction to discarding, whereas individuals with hoarding disorder have a strong emotional attachment and also individuals with hoarding disorder tend not to gravitate to certain kinds of items, they tend to be more indiscriminate.",yes.
2022,2022_343.txt,0,0.5304601192474365,"have you ever encountered an individual that you felt was a borderline case, or somebody who you were kind of not sure about whether they would fit this diagnosis or not, and can you tell me a little bit about a case like that?","yeah, so i INAUDIBLE mostly because families are involved or because of the space. you know, a lot of my clients don't actually meet clinical diagnosis, or wouldn't meet a clinical diagnosis because they may live in a facility that has certain rules or certain guidelines, or they may live with their family members or have been working on their hoarding disorder for long periods of time, but they still have the emotional attachment to objects and they still have the anxiety and the difficulty discarding and trouble with organization, so they still have all of the trouble that goes along with the hoarding disorder, but their space may not meet the diagnosis. so, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it. so, they may still be suffering from the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but not actually meet a diagnosis. so, i will get clients like that often."
2022,2022_344.txt,0,0.5444555878639221,"do you ever feel that there is a borderline or a difficult with hoarding disorder in other co-morbid disorders? so, do you ever have difficulty telling if somebody is truly depressed or perhaps has a sense of compulsive disorder, versus they truly have hoarding disorder?","yes, i do see that but because i do treatment in the field, regardless of whatever they're struggling with, a lot of the treatment for the actual trouble with the items is the same. so, i'll be working with them, you know if they have other issues going on, you know working with their anxiety but then working with their hoarding problem the same way as i would with anybody."

2022,2022_344.txt,0,0.5215038657188416,it's a justification rather than a real thing.,"yeah exactly, a justification. so, you know if you have 5 of something you only maybe need 2 of at the most, but that is a reason a lot of my clients use."
2022,2022_345.txt,0,0.7725173234939575,"now i'd like to talk more specifically about the dsm-iv criteria themselves. thinking about the diagnosis of hoarding and the criteria for the diagnosis of hoarding, are there any particular elements that kind of off the top of your head you think of as particularly difficult to apply or that different clinicians might apply differently or might be particularly subjective?","well i think that the dsm-iv doesn't really take into account other settings. like, you may see hoarding disorder or hoarding behavior, so i have to often...even though somebody had hoarding behaviors in the community but no one ever really diagnosed them, and if they come into a care setting like a long-term care setting or a hospital, they're still having that hoarding behavior and the difficulty discarding, but they wouldn't meet the criteria because their space isn't cluttered because they're living in a care home, but they still would have hoarding disorder. so, i think there's a lack of looking at the INAUDIBLE spaces with the diagnosis. so, i think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. and you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. i also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. like in the area where i live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience. so, clients can't see somebody that can diagnose them with something because of the lack of experience with professionals. i have no idea if i answered your whole question LAUGHS."
2022,2022_345.txt,0,0.2842586040496826,"yeah, no you totally did. it sounds like particularly you're talking about the part of the dsm-iv that says, ""the difficulty discarding possessions results the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use,"" and it sounds like your problem with this is that people sometimes don't have control over their spaces, and so their active living areas aren't technically compromised and so they don't meet this criteria and so then they don't get the diagnosis, even though they exhibit all of the behaviors and ideation that go along with hoarding disorder. does that seem right?","yes, that's right."
2022,2022_345.txt,0,0.7027260661125183,"yeah i mean that is a question that i have about the dsm-iv as well and i was gonna ask you in particular, in situations like this how you make a judgement about whether you would consider them a person with hoarding disorder when this criteria isn't met, and it sounds like what you're saying is for you this criteria isn't a deal breaker. that they might not have congested and cluttered active living areas, but that they still might be a person with hoarding disorder. does that?","yeah, exactly. so, you know if they have the difficulty discarding, trouble with decision-making, all the other things, i think that they still may have hoarding disorder but because we can't get a diagnosis i kind of differentiate hoarding behavior and hoarding disorder because we can't have a diagnosis, but i see this often in my work."
2022,2022_346.txt,0,0.7069658637046814,"so there's another component about the dsm-iv that talks about difficulty discarding regardless of actual value, and i'm wondering if you've ever dealt with this as a component of wondering if somebody is an individual with hoarding disorder? so, does the value of the possessions that they're saving play into your thinking about this disorder? we tend to think of individuals with hoarding disorder as saving things that are objectively valueless or over-estimating the value of items, but could you have a person who has this disorder who saves things that are valuable?","yes, yeah that also is something...like i have clients who will only hoard brand-new item, like electronics, but they have the same feelings towards these objects even though they haven't used them, they have no immediate use for it, it's cluttering up you know. they can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so i think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. so, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. i think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working INAUDIBLE what they think is valuable or not."
2022,2022_346.txt,0,0.3319789171218872,"so, it sounds like for you the really crucial thing with individuals with this--and i like how you say this behavior, it sounds like it really comes down to the kind of attachment to objects, their emotional connection to object. does that sound right?","exactly, yeah."
2022,2022_346.txt,0,0.646370530128479,"and so it doesn't really matter what they're saving or how much they have because how much they have and what they're saving is kind of contextual, but if they have that strong sense of emotional connection to an object, that for you qualifies them as at least having behavior even if you can't technically give them the diagnosis. does that sound right?","right and maybe also with the decision-making. like when i talk to people, when they have difficulties knowing what to recycle and what to put in the garbage and what's still usable and what isn't usable, that also can be an indication to me along with the attachment to the object and those emotional feelings towards the object, that can be telling to me about whether they have hoarding behavior."
2022,2022_347.txt,0,0.6913899183273315,"do you feel like there's a component of hoarding i guess we'll say behavior that is about the management of space? so, some people might enjoy a very clear and open space, whereas other people may feel really comfortable being surrounded by objects in a different way. do you feel like is a part of hoarding behavior, or do you think that that is separate or not always seen, or sometimes?","yeah, i think it depends on the person and you know i think it really takes a lot of time to understand somebody. like why do they feel safe in a place that has a lot of stuff? like what is it about the stuff and their space that is making them feel comfortable? and i think it's really important for anybody to understand that not everybody lives in the same way, like i wound't necessarily live in a home like my friend who has lots of stuff, but she may be more comfortable in that space than i am. so, i think when i look at it, i look at why they are living in that space and if there's safety lists involved that they're not considering, like i can see a lot from somebody i get a lot of consultations about. you know, this person is hoarding and then i go into their home and they just have a lot of stuff. there's no safety risks, but their family or their mental health worker just views it as being like not good or not a way that they would live. so, you know, in my experience i look at...when i'm looking specifically at space, less at their attachment, i look at the safety risks."
2022,2022_347.txt,0,0.5501854419708252,"so, you might go into somebody's house and feel like wow this is really a lot of stuff, but you don't make the call as to whether it's a disorder on the basis of your subjective impression of how much they have. you really only look at their space in terms of can they...is it interfering with their activities of daily living, can they get in and out of the house, does that sound right?","right, or if it's a fire risk and do they really feel safe in that space or comfortable in that space, or do they just feel uncomfortable with changing that space? so, i kind of have to make sure there's a differentiation between what's comfortable for them and if they're just not wanting to deal with the space. but really looking less at my own feelings towards their home, if that makes sense."
2022,2022_347.txt,0,0.3660016357898712,do you frequently asses your clients' homes or space as part of an evaluation?,"yes, especially because--"
2022,2022_347.txt,0,0.8200454711914062,and do you typically go to their home?,"yeah, i go to their homes."
2022,2022_347.txt,0,0.3281484842300415,"and what were you going to say, especially because?","because that's kind of the only way that people get some service or...you know, that's the only way that i'm often involved in their space is because somebody else said that their space is unsafe for them to live in, so i look at the safety risks. if someone invites me into their home, generally it's because they want to make changes on their own and i do look at the safety risks but...yeah the safety risks is one of the biggest things i look at."
2022,2022_348.txt,0,0.2458357810974121,"so, often it's because somebody else has judges their space to be kind of a risk, and so you go into their home to assess the safety and to see if it really is a risk.",exactly.
2022,2022_348.txt,0,0.7466393709182739,"earlier i asked you for a list of ways that you could tell a person had hoarding disorder, and i wonder if in addition to kind of the objective list, when i do these interviews with clinicians they sometimes say that like if they were to look at a waiting room at a new patient, they would often be able to feel like they could tell if that person was coming in for hoarding problems, and they kind of give almost like a stereotypical picture of what that patient looks like. i wonder if you have a sense, if a patient is sitting in your waiting room, you've never seen them before but you kind of can guess that they're there for hoarding problems. what does that person look like?","so, well there are i guess times where i have an idea that they may have it, but i also want to add that a lot of people have hoarding problems and they don't look like it at all. many of my clients work full-time jobs and they work in government jobs and they work as teachers or whatever, and they don't look at all like they would have a typical hoarding disorder, but if i saw somebody that you know...they usually are carrying a lot of random things like shopping bags or reusable bags that have like a lot of paper or bottles. sometimes they look like they haven't bathed or showered because they may not have the ability to shower often. they may look, sometimes they wear layers of clothing or have items that wouldn't really fit with going out to an appointment on them like quite a bit of books or papers or scrap papers."
2022,2022_348.txt,0,0.3610740900039673,"do you feel like there are likewise kind of stereotypical personalities, like they tend to be a certain kind of person, they tend to have certain other kind of non-clinical personality traits?",no.

2022,2022_348.txt,0,0.7262598872184753,"so like for example, sometimes clinicians will say that their hoarding clients are particularly creative, are particularly bubbly or extraverted, want to be involved in everything that's around them, that's the kind of thing i'm getting at.","okay, well i do think that a lot of my clients do think in very creative ways, like they may not be creative like art creative, but they can find uses for items that i would never think about. so, they can reuse objects or have ideas for certain things that they can create or use them for, but for me my clients vary so much from extraverted to introverted, it just kind of depends on the person. but yeah, they do have very creative minds and often seem a bit disorganized. like, they can't organize, it may not be about their items or their space, but they sometimes have very disorganized thinking. so, it's hard for them to stick to one topic at a time when talking. they'll kind of move around in the conversation and get distracted."
2022,2022_349.txt,0,0.29897284507751465,"so, kind of the same sort of difficulty judging the importance or prioritizing in speech as they might have with objects.","yes, exactly."
2022,2022_349.txt,0,0.7206171751022339,"so, now i'd like to talk about the criteria in the dsm which says, ""this difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them."" so, i guess i'm wondering how you asses that kind of degree of distress associated with discarding? especially because people might deny distress, so it may be purely hypothetical distress, so they might be more distressed at their behavior--i guess first of all, how do you make that assessment?","yeah, so when discussing about what to discard, if clients have difficulty knowing where to start of what items to discard. so, they may look at like a newspaper from 10 years ago the same as they would a brand new book. so, they don't know what to discard, they have no starting point so when they start to think about discarding you can tell by body language that they're having difficulty even deciding what item to pick up and then getting distressed when thinking about what to do with it. so, it's not just about like, ""i'm gonna get rid of...in this table i'm gonna pick up all the garbage and throw the garbage away,"" but what is garbage and what isn't garbage. so, i think that is a distress because when they try to make a decision, they just kind of shut down and they can't make that decision. so, they have difficulty knowing where to start, and then the anxiety that they get. so, a lot of times they'll do self-talk like, ""well i guess i could get rid of this,"" or ""i could use this for this"" or you know, they can't really make that one decision quickly. they have to kind of go through the motions of what if. they always talk about what ifs, and i know they're starting to get distressed when they're thinking about all the possibilities. when they're trying to make a decision it's, ""what could go wrong."" they start catastrophizing, you know, ""if i got rid of this item,"" kind of think about the worst possible thing that could happen, instead of just, ""i'm getting rid of it and then it's out of my head."" and then they will start to ruminate on the possibility that they made a mistake if they do make a decision, so that's kind of how i measure distress. they may not say, ""i[m distressed"" or that they have difficulty, but the length of time even to make a decision is telling."
2022,2022_349.txt,0,0.29633867740631104,"do you have patients that deny that they would be distressed if they discarded? so, you're sitting with a patient and you say, ""well if you were to throw out this news paper, would it distress you?"" and they would say, ""no, i would be fine throwing it out,"" do you have that interaction with patients? or is it--",yeah.
2022,2022_349.txt,0,0.43372705578804016,"how do you feel with that? how do you kind of push on that? do you ask them to then discard it, or?","yeah, basically."

2022,2022_350.txt,0,0.5300927758216858,so you have to kind of confront them with it before they are even aware that they would be distressed.,"yeah, or you know i think sometimes they know they may be distressed or have difficulty, but they don't want to admit it. i think what matters a lot for like the practitioner working with them is to have a really strong therapeutic relationship, where they feel comfortable talking about their feelings. otherwise, helping them to reach a level of insight into their feelings is really difficult, and it's hard to learn new behaviors and to work on the actual attachment or the emotional part of the treatment if they don't have insight into their feelings."
2022,2022_350.txt,0,0.748200535774231,"you use the word insight, and insight is a lot, in hoarding literature, kind of identified as a difficulty with this disorder, so i'd like to turn the conversation to insight, but first i want to ask how you would define insight in the context of hoarding disorder?","whether people can recognize that they are having difficulties or anxieties or difficulties with discarding if they see the risks involved with their behavior. so, if they, you know...i don't always, it doesn't always matter to me if they say, ""i have hoarding disorder, i have a hoarding problem"" or ""i hoard items,"" because i think there's a lot of negative aspects to using that word with clients, they don't want to be labeled. and so i don't always think like insight means they have to--"
2022,2022_350.txt,0,0.6472280025482178,identify as a hoarder.,"identify that they are hoarding or have a hoarding problem. so, it's more about whether they see the risks involved or whether they see what their behavior is doing to others and what it's doing to themselves, even if they can't recognize their feelings. but you know, do they understand that they're having difficulty sleeping because they have so much stuff in their bed that they sleep on the couch? and that it's the amount of stuff that they have is contributing to the fact that they can't do certain things or that they are having difficulty discarding that other people wouldn't have."
2022,2022_351.txt,0,0.7434773445129395,"and when you see clients, how much insight would you say most people have by the time you see them?","it depends on how they're being referred to me. so, you know i often get family members that will ask me to go and talk to their family member with them, kind of like an intervention or going in to assess. the city might ask me to go in and assess, so it depends if the client is asking to see help or agreeing with seeking help, or not. so, if the client is agreeing, they usually have some level of insight. usually they can't understand all of how their behaviors are contributing to their anxiety or depression or whatever, or how much of a safety risk it is, but they have an idea that they have an issue, but if somebody else is referring them they usually have some insight that they have more stuff than other people, but they don't know why other people are bothered by it. so, it kind of depends on how they come to me. and i often find clients who have a lot of stuff and are having difficulty, they have some insight. like, a lot of times i know research says that they don't, but i find that they do understand that their living spaces do not fit other living spaces. or how society deems them to have certain living spaces, that's why they're not letting people into their home, because they know they're going to be judged based on their living space. they may not understand fully, but they have some insight."
2022,2022_351.txt,0,0.3372713327407837,"so, it sounds like you're almost drawing a distinction here between two different kind of levels or kinds of insight. so, it sounds like you're saying that most people are aware that they have more space than average, or they have more stuff than average, and to some extent are aware that there's stigma around having this much stuff or that other people might not get it. and then there's kind of the second level, which is recognizing that having so much stuff is causing them distress, or causing their life to have--having negative impacts on their lives. and it sounds like you're saying the first kind of insight, recognizing the behavior as abnormal is pretty common, and then the second level of insight, recognizing the behavior as kind of contributing to difficulties in their life, is less common or more difficult to achieve. does that sound right?","yes, i think so yeah."

2022,2022_354.txt,0,0.7947106957435608,"so it seems like they're saving it and then maybe when they're questioned as to why they're saving it, they're coming up with a reason.","yeah, i think it could be different in different people, but it my experience most of the time, they'll say a reason why they're saving it and then i will kind of refuse that and say ""well there has to be more,"" and then they'll come up with another reason. so, i don't think that the reason for actually saving that they're giving me is the reason why they're saving it."
2022,2022_354.txt,0,0.4464865028858185,"so, the behavior is kind of driving the justification.",i think so.
2022,2022_355.txt,0,0.5598275661468506,"how long have these kinds of, for the patients you tend to see, how long has the behavior typically been doing on when you see them? do you have any sense of that?","well on average from my experience, they've had these saving behaviors, the difficulty discarding for a long long period of time, probably as long as they can remember. they remember childhood and having some behaviors, but it hasn't gotten to the point where it's been a problem or that they've recognized or someone else has noticed as being a problem. usually they can tell me about some big event that happened like loss of their family and they've inherited some things and they've ended up having so many things that it became overwhelming and they just kind of gave up on managing it. so, usually they've been managing it, you know they've always had a little bit too much stuff but something has prompted them to stop managing it, and then it became out of control like a health issue, or caring for a family member, or loss of the family member, some big event. it's not always like that, but generally they talk about having these behaviors for like their life."
2022,2022_356.txt,0,0.7796710133552551,"so, literature on hoarding disorder kind of says it tends to be older people who are people with hoarding problems, and i guess i'm wondering do you feel like it's because it's a progressive disorder, so it worsens with age, maybe with cognitive decline? or do you feel like that's more related to their life course in terms of their parents have died, they've inherited things, their children have left their home, or their spouses died, or they've gotten divorced and now they--it's not that the behavior necessarily has gotten worse so much as their life has changed to the point that the management of objects has gotten out of control? like due to mobility issues just with having a house and accumulating stuff within it, or maybe both?","yeah, i think it's a little bit of both but i think it's usually, like for my clients i have clients that are 18 to 90-something years old, and i think that all of the older clients can talk about that they did have some of the behaviors and the tendencies until something happened, and i think it's accumulation of the objects or major stressors that have caused backsliding. you know, they often will talk about how they tried to manage it or that they tried to keep things clear and they tried to work on their discarding, and then something else has happened. so i think when they're adults there's also accumulation of stuff, the life events that have happened, they're also accumulating a lot of the times stuff of their children or grandchildren that lived in their home, they're also dealing with major life stressors that may be contributing to the difficulties that they're having. they also have mobility and other health issues that are involved, so they can't do the same things that they used to do like move things around or get rid of things. they may not be driving, but i think that it may not be that the actual hoarding or the actual feelings or attachment has gotten worse with older adults, i think it's accumulation of what's happened in their life. like the life events and the accumulation of items, because my clients that are 18 can talk about items the same way and have the same feelings as somebody in their 80s. and usually the older adults don't have the outside influence of their parents or spouse or partner, roommates that are stopping them from over cluttering. you know, they're usually living alone or they're in their own space so that they're able to accumulate in a way. they're not having like that outside influence."
2022,2022_356.txt,0,0.5422475934028625,"so it sounds like the impulse may be the same, but it's a lot of social factors that turn it into a bigger problem for older adults. so, younger people might have hoarding behavior and might have the kind of ideation that goes along with it. does that sound right?","yes. in some cases i do have some younger clients that they are having, like their houses are so filled that they can't use spaces and would meet the dsm diagnosis, but they also have other factors too like they do have health issues. they may have fibromyalgia, they may have ibs or some other medical issues that make it difficult for them to manage everything."
2023,2023_357.txt,0,0.5504308938980103,"so that's the last list that i have for you. how are we doing on time, do you have to run?","i'm okay, i sent actually an email just to say that i'm gonna be a few minutes late so if it's 10 minutes more i'll be okay."
2023,2023_357.txt,0,0.7800934314727783,"yeah, so let's have you tell me a little bit about your background just very briefly in terms of your training and how you see individuals with hoarding disorder.","sure, so i'm a trained psychologist and social worker and i came to my work with hoarding actually through work with ocd first and then began working more with people with hoarding over time. i think based on my earlier experiences, some people found it very frustrating to work with people with hoarding, i more challenging but fascinating as well. so i kind of move in that direction and was much more INAUDIBLE kind of behavioral therapy training or erp to start with back in the day before INAUDIBLE and randy frost developed more specialized treatment and kind of moved more into that model. and then i've kind of expanded into multiple models in terms of thinking about various domains and working in housing and public health and other areas as well. so, have kind of like expanded out in that, but definitely come from a mental health background in terms of training."
2023,2023_357.txt,0,0.391274631023407,"so now i'd like to talk to you about the ways that you diagnose hoarding disorder, and specifically about the dsm-iv criteria. please cut us off when you have to go and i'll follow up over email, and if we can find another time that's great, but i want to get as far as we can get but let me know when you're out of time, okay?","yeah, no problem."
2023,2023_357.txt,0,0.6245071291923523,"okay. so, thinking about the dsm-iv criteria specifically, are there any aspect of the dsm-iv specifically off the top of your head that you regard as kind of difficult to apply or that you thought perhaps rely on clinical judgement or that you worry that different clinicians might apply differently?","that's a good question, i think the fact that acquisition is a specifier as opposed to one of the core criteria can potentially be, it's not difficult to use but at the same time i think that could be confusing to some in terms of how to apply it, especially in the community in terms of using it as opposed to kind of research focused. and also i think in terms of insight, where sometimes there's some confusion in terms of where some clients feel pushed against the wall so they'll seem reluctant or seem like they're not recognizing what the issue is, but there's a lot of shame and other experiences that they've had, so it's not really that they totally lack insight, but to actually...i don't want to say admit a problem but to like speak to it a certain way makes them feel like they're gonna have to comply with their things and it's scary in terms of having, what are their rights in that scenario or the dynamics of the family and so forth as well."
2023,2023_358.txt,0,0.7412910461425781,"so there's a whole conversation i'd like to have with you about insight and what exactly that means, and i'm not sure we're gonna have time for it today but it sounds like what you're saying is that a lot of times it may seem like an individual doesn't have insight because they're not admitting that they have a problem, but they may actually be more aware of their problem but just be unable to admit it because admitting it would kind of seem to push them to take some kind of action or to be judged somehow. does that sound right?","yeah, and some people don't necessarily want mental health treatment, you know like in the case of i want to hold onto my housing. you know, ""i'm not necessarily interested in mental health treatment, i want to hold onto my housing."" so, that's very different from somebody who's in mental health care already in addressing the issue of insight. i guess when i'm thinking of insight i'm thinking around the dsm specifically, so i'm thinking about how do people kind of what do they say in terms of what do they recognize in terms of labeling and what accounts perhaps for that as well."
2023,2023_358.txt,0,0.23833498358726501,"right, right.","i think the other things is that, so there's comorbidity that come out with hoarding around depression, around ocd and so forth and i think that sometimes there's confusion in the field around that in terms of what is what. people are so focused on the clutter, what's secondary to... what's actually hoarding and what is secondary to other mental health or physical health problem. the other thing that comes up is issues around trauma, so how does trauma kind of fit in. so, you know, some of the comorbidity research shows that there's a low rate of ptsd. folks i've met with will talk about a traumatic event, it doesn't mean that it's ptsd and there's some myths out there that trauma causes hoarding and the research doesn't really support that. so i think that can affect the diagnosing a bit and the issues around the criteria a bit in terms of the role of trauma."
2023,2023_358.txt,0,0.7177871465682983,can you think of a challenging case where you were unsure if something was truly hoarding disorder or either another mental health disorder or something that's on the spectrum of hoarding behavior? have you ever had that experience with a person who potentially had hoarding?,"yeah, i think it depends sometimes on what our role is, right. so we talk about this in training a bit, we'll show people a picture and they're sure it's hoarding LAUGHS. they're sure it's squalor and hoarding, and just because it looks like that in terms of clutter doesn't mean it's specific to the dsm criteria around hoarding, right. so, there could be a lot of reasons that there could be squalor or clutter in their environment that may not be specifically hoarding. can you repeat your question again?"
2023,2023_359.txt,0,0.7122841477394104,"yeah, i was asking if you have had the experience of having a really challenging diagnosis where you were't sure if something was truly hoarding or was either another mental health diagnosis or something else entirely. have you ever had that experience, and can you think of an example of a time where you were really unsure if something was hoarding or wasn't?","yeah we had, just a quick one and then unfortunately i'm gonna have to run, i'm getting distracted because people are at my door LAUGHS, they keep coming back to my door every once in a while, so sorry about that. so, yeah i mean in one case there was a person who was, a lot of what they were collecting was like food wrappers and containers and so forth, and there were a lot of them in addition to other things, and it was hard to know whether it was hoarding or whether it was depression or if it was eating issues as well, and the way that at first the person was answering questions and based on conversation it seemed like they were having difficulty letting go of the papers and whatever the food came in, the containers and stuff. and then, but overtime, a pretty brief time, it became clear that actually it was the clutter that was attached to that and a number of other things that was really more related to the depression, and also some eating disorder issues as well. but you know, in terms of the specific items that they're holding onto and also in terms of how they were kind of answering the typical questions, it seemed it was hoarding but something kind of just didn't fully match, and so with more exploration and over time it became clear that the treatment specific for hoarding wasn't really a fit, it was more a need to address something in the mental health issues that were going on that were really more salient and the clutter was more secondary. so that's kind of just like a quick example of when it's come up, and sometimes it's kind of teasing it out of them as well."
2024,2024_360.txt,0,0.38373544812202454,"sure, yeah perfect. and again, you know, you might be tempted to say that you're not the right person to answer some of these questions, but i mean i think that you're--what the study is really aiming to get at is perception, so i think that'll be perfect. just to give you a framing of what we're gonna do today, our interview has two sections. the first section uses a technique that's called free listing, and the idea behind free listing is, it's a little bit like a fluency test. we will give you a prompt and then we'll ask for you to give us off the top of your head a list that comes to mind. so an example of a prompt might be, ""could you please list for me all the animals that you can think of"" and then you would go ahead and say, ""dog, cat, lion, tiger"" and keep going until you can't think of any more. and the difference between this and a fluency test is that it's not timed at all, and we are most interested in what items you list and what order they're listed in, and we want to get an exhaustive list from you, so feel free to take your time. and the idea again is just to generate a list, so fairly short responses if possible.",okay.
2024,2024_361.txt,0,0.5595470070838928,"mhhm, mhmm. okay, well i'm gonna move into the more conversational interview and we're gonna talk about a lot of the issues that came up in our list in more detail, but before we get started if you wouldn't mind just giving me like a...i don't know, two minute introduction to who you are and your training and background and how you came to be involved with patients with this disorder.","yeah, sure of course. so i'm a clinical psychologist and i am just out of my post-doc, so i pretty much INAUDIBLE last year, in the ocd and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with ocd and hoarding disorder INAUDIBLE primary to diagnosing that i focused on and um--but before then, so the reason i guess i can kind of share with you how i got there. so, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, i went to grad school in INSTITUTION in portland, outside of portland, oregon and i was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and i knew that going into grad school and so i knew i wanted to get some training in that and when i was at INSTITUTION doing my grad school program, i basically i pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like ocd and other social anxiety and disorders like that that i was primarily interested in, at first. and then i just joined a research team called the anxiety research team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and i was passed along some articles and i did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. but i started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, i guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when i first started grad school but for ocd and anxiety and i was pretty intrigued. i also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so i think i got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. i remember reading prolonged exposure for ptsd was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really INAUDIBLE and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so i think i just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. so, i got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called the anxiety and panic treatment center in portland, and i did my practicum, too, there and then i stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because i enjoy it so much and i was learning quite a bit and i was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as ocd and then i guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. there were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so i was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. so, i was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. so, we were like the only people in the portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. so i got some experience there and i learned quite a bit from those experiences. i even was contracted or was, i don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. and so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. so i was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the cbt towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where i went out to people's homes. and form that i went to internship, which was at a va and i didn't really do much with hoarding, i was more focused on ptsd, and then i kind of went to the post-doc at NAME lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. and then i did home decluttering and i did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then i also worked with some folks individually and i'm planning to eventually, i'm working in the clinic at INSTITUTION and i'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding INAUDIBLE or like cbt groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this."
2024,2024_362.txt,0,0.7235696315765381,"awesome, well i'm really excited hear your answers for our questions, given how much experience you've had actually treating patients in patients' homes. so the first question that i'm gonna ask, so the first thing that we're gonna do is talk about what constitutes hoarding disorder, so to start off thinking about that, how would you describe the most important differences between normal saving behaviors, such as collecting perhaps, and hoarding disorder?","yeah, good question. so, i think the really big difference, there's a couple key differences i think, a lot of people collect and i think...i can't remember what year it was but i don't remember the percentage but there was a study done in the uk and it showed like 25% of the population engaged in collecting. so, obviously collecting is distinct from difficulties that are associated with hoarding disorder. i think one reason is that when someone's collecting, they tend to be able to organize their collection and kind of store their collection away, so if they're collecting stamps or what have you, they're kind of organized and they have a home and then these folks tend to bring up these collections and they tend to show them off with pride, there's joy associated with them like, ""look at these fans"" or maybe find other people who are interested in that particular item and they may show these items with joy and pride; whereas folks who are struggling with hoarding disorder tend to experience a lot of shame. there aren't, the items aren't necessarily organized in that neat, nice structured fashion and they're not necessarily showing others with pride. there's actually a lot of shame and distress associated with the items. i think that's a key difference, and those are the primary differences, now that i'm thinking about it actually. like the way in which they're stored, folks with hoarding disorder don't have these items stored away so they can bring them out and show people, and the feelings associated with it. so, kind of the feeling of pride when someone's showing off their collection, versus somebody who is ashamed and has negative emotion around having all of these items in their home."
2024,2024_362.txt,0,0.42023012042045593,mhhmm,so those are kind of the two primary.
2024,2024_363.txt,0,0.7469425201416016,"what for you, i mean, is it possible to have hoarding disorder and only to hoard certain kinds of objects the way that we might think of a collector? so, could you hoard, for example, cuckoo clocks or bird feeders, you know.","yeah, yeah, definitely, i think you can. however, i think the difference is, like it's interesting that you mentioned cuckoo clocks because i've actually worked with an individual who loved cuckoo clocks and had several cuckoo clocks, but as we were doing our decluttering exercises, she was coming across one she hadn't seen in years and forgot she owned. so i think, you know, she loved cuckoo clocks and she had several, she even had one up on her wall actually; however, we were finding cuckoo clocks that she didn't even remember she had because they were lost in her clutter. and so, ultimately, you know, i think we could say she was collecting, and that was aesthetic, that was purely just loving cuckoo clocks and the way they look. and she loved germany and she got several from germany and things like that, so there might be some, maybe this can make it down to that sentimental value, too, so there might be some reasons why this person liked cuckoo clocks, but ultimately, yes i think that an individual can hoard one kind of item or a specific kind of item. however, i don't think it's limited to that. so like, this individual who loved cuckoo clocks also acquired a lot of other things, so it was more than just the cuckoo clocks and i think that's why this individual wasn't able to enjoy the cuckoo clocks in the way that someone who was just collecting them might, because she wasn't able to find them or retrieve them when she wanted to. or even, you know, eventually folks might forget that they have some of these objects, right. so i think that with collecting, individuals mostly know like what items they have, they can pull them out and look at them."
2024,2024_363.txt,0,0.36624494194984436,"can you think of a specific case or cases that was challenging for you to diagnose? either, for a bunch of reasons, because it was on the border between pathological or non-pathological?","yeah, yeah."
2024,2024_364.txt,0,0.30877023935317993,and could you just walk me through the outline of that case?,"yeah, i can think of maybe a couple of cases. i think where it can get tricky is that hoarding, or individuals who struggle with hoarding, tend to...or the traits tend to show up when they're relatively young, so like adolescent years. and i think that if someone is struggling early on, and they're not actually acquiring enough or having difficulties discarding enough where it's like resulting in clutter that's actually compromising their space or that's like a hazard, then according to the criteria, then it wouldn't be criteria for diagnosis. so, someone might be struggling with hoarding or acquiring objects excessively and might be struggling with discarding, but if they can still use all the spaces in their home, then that kind of puts you in a tricky spot. because what if not giving this person the diagnosis means they don't get services; however, they don't meet diagnosis, so you can't give them the diagnosis because they don't have the clutter or the, if their home isn't compromised in that way and their space isn't compromised in that way, then you can't come up with a diagnosis at the level of significance where it would need a diagnosis. so that would be, you know, i actually haven't, the only place i've seen that come up is in our research study, because we're looking at folks who are a little less severe and because we don't, because or irb, we're not seeing people who are being threatened with eviction or because we're going into the home, there can't be mold, there can't be...you know, clutter can't be stacked super high because of earthquake risk and things like that, and so we're actually seeing folks who do kind of fall in that line of is it actually hoarding disorder? does this meet criteria? and i think for some folks we've had to say no it doesn't, because their home doesn't, the only thing they're saving is the revised inventory questionnaire, if it doesn't meet the threshold, like if they don't have that perceived need to save to the degree that causes impairment or causes distress, then we wouldn't diagnose. so i think taking a look at things like the savings inventory revised or the clutter image rating scale, having a person do those can help you see what actually, is this actually pathological as well as asking them more subjectively like what their home is like and what's their experience inside their home."
2024,2024_365.txt,0,0.7784863710403442,"and we're gonna talk through this criteria in a little bit more detail. i'm also wondering how you make distinctions, or if it's ever tricky to make distinctions between hoarding disorder and other possibly comorbid disorders, specifically depression and ocd. do you ever have difficulty in kind of discriminating between a hoarding disorder patient and an ocd patient and a depressed patient?","yeah, yeah, definitely. i think it's important to know, especially with ocd, to know ocd well and when you're--because of course hoarding, difficulty discarding possessions can definitely be a part of ocd, even now they could still be a part of ocd, even though hoarding disorder has its own separate diagnosis. so, i think being careful and when you're looking at differentiating between ocd and hoarding disorder, for example, making sure that hoarding is the primary issue and is basically what the person is struggling with can help you decide whether or not it's assumed as under ocd, as well as looking at some of these ocd-themed...like i've worked with folks, i worked with an individual who was diagnosed with ocd and not hoarding disorder, although had difficulties discarding, and not so much acquiring, it was more discarding. but that was because she was fearful of making a mistake and throwing something out that was important and that she would need, so we would check it several times and it was kind of consistent with her other checking behaviors, which she was also worried about catastrophe and fires and so she would check her door and check her stove, and so it was really consistent with the ocd presentations. so it fits in with the way that we were conceptualizing her ocd; whereas if that wouldn't have been the case, if hoarding was actually the primary issue, we would likely not have diagnosed, she wouldn't have gotten the diagnosis of ocd."
2024,2024_365.txt,0,0.556164026260376,"so in this case what seems to be the most important factor in making that distinction is not about their space, but it's about their reasons why they are saving. if they are more reasons that are more related to ocd behaviors or if they're true hoarding, yeah?","right, right yeah. and i think um, and that could be, you know i guess this might be a questions in research, like how often does ocd and hoarding disorder, is that diagnosed. i've never diagnosed both and i don't know if there'd be a situation where you could argue that that could happen, but i've never actually diagnosed both and i think that because of the newer diagnosis and because it's related to ocd, you know, i guess technically you probably could diagnose both. i mean if you look at the why box on hoarding, i think it's still on there, although i don't know if that will change in the future or if we will continue to keep those items in ocd or look to separating the two more. i think that'll be a question for research and for a future study, like does that make sense and is it counterindicated or does ocd kind of explain a person's difficulties with hoarding, is it necessary to give them another label or not, and i guess what would prompt an individual to do that? but yeah, those are good questions."
2024,2024_366.txt,0,0.5942285060882568,"so i'm gonna ask you now just to talk through with me some of the diagnosis criteria. before we begin, i just want to know if any of the elements in the criteria in the dsm-v you find particularly difficult to apply or subjective or that you wonder if different clinicians might apply differently? does anything jump out to you from the dsm-v?","yeah sure, sure. yeah, i think that's a good question. i think ultimately the dsm runs pretty well, you know, that the heart of this diagnosis has to do with that perceived need to save and that difficulty upon attempting to discard, so that distress associated with discarding and that perceived need to save. i think that's at the heart of it and i think the dsm does outline that. i think the one criteria i might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. i think that when we think about the internet and i already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? it might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the dsm doesn't really talk about. if an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the dsm doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, i mean i'm not sure what you would diagnose. and ultimately that could be one point issue."
2024,2024_367.txt,0,0.6365370154380798,"for that criteria, the difficulty discarding results in accumulation that congest and clutter and substantially compromise intended use, i wonder also if you think that external factors may play a role in that substantially compromising of intended use. for example, if somebody is very wealthy and lives in a extremely large home, versus somebody who lives in a trailer and has less space, is it possible to be so wealthy that you never compromise your intended...you know, your space's intended use because you have many storage units, for example?","yeah, yeah that's a really good question. i think that definitely could be possible and i think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that i've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. but if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, i think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, i think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the dsm writes. and i think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the uk and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the uk, they tend to live in smaller spaces and i wonder if places like san francisco of new york where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient."
2024,2024_368.txt,0,0.8037386536598206,"right, right, right, cuz everybody just has less space to live, that's interesting. i also want to ask you about this idea of intended use. so we could imagine a healthy person who, for example, has a spare bed room that they use for storage, or doesn't cook and therefore doesn't use their kitchen for cooking, but instead uses it for storage. so i wonder how you think about this concept of compromising intended use. like, who's intended use and how do you make judgments about whether that's appropriate or not?","yeah, yeah, i think that's a really good question. when we think about intended use, i think it probably does kind of come from this, i guess societal, just in general what do we use a kitchen for, what was that designed for, when someone built that home, that apartment, they thought that you would be cooking in it. but, then again, that is not obviously taking the person's view point into consideration or like their own experience and their values and if they don't care about cooking or that's not something they ever want to do, you know, is that compromising the use? i think for the intended use, like the same thing can come up with ocd, for example, like if someone is fearful of starting a fire because of the stove, they might not use their stove or their kitchen for cooking whatsoever. it doesn't mean that it's cluttered, but they're still not using it and so the ocd has compromised the room's use, but then i've had people say, ""well i don't care about cooking, it has no value in cooking at all so i don't even want to work on that because that's not a value of mine,"" and so i could see how that could come up. i think with hoarding disorder what we think about is if someone moved or lived with a family member who wasn't struggling with hoarding or you know, or if we were to think about what is the typical use of a kitchen, to cook, or a bedroom to sleep, i think that even if an individual suggests that that's not how they intend to use it, i think the way we've looked at it is that intended use is more like the blueprint. like what did the architect intend for this space to be used and how was that planned to be used or maybe even how did they plan to use it originally. maybe when they first moved into the home they did a little bit of cooking, or maybe they ate at their table but now they're not eating. so, i think i do like to, especially when this is just clinical practice and not a research study, i do like to kind of obviously meet the person where they're at and if they don't care about the kitchen or they don't care about cooking, maybe they care about being able to host people in their living room and have a space for people to sit and enjoy the conversation or something like that. so, kind of looking at what uses or what are they not doing in their home that they would like to do, and then focusing on that, especially when we're looking at just treatment in a community setting and not like placing my own values on somebody. like, kitchens need to be used for cooking and focusing more on that. but in terms of diagnosis, i know that's what we're talking about, it's an interesting question. there's a little bit of a bias in thinking that others should be using their homes in a specific kind of way."
2024,2024_369.txt,0,0.5968722701072693,"so, kind of along the same lines we can imagine for normal individuals a variance in how they like to keep their space. so for example, some people might love to have a very clear desk and only be able to work when the desk is clear; whereas other people might actually really like a crowded desk or feeling that their items are all around them, and i wonder if you've ever conceptualized or thought about hoarding disorder as being a part of that spectrum? so do you feel like perhaps a part of hoarding disorder is about liking the creation of inclosed space, or liking to be surrounded maybe on a spectrum like fear of open spaces, like the opposite or something like that where people just really like to be inclosed by items.","yeah, yeah actually that's a good point. yeah, i think that that definitely could be the case. but i think that what's really important here if we're looking at diagnosing hoarding disorder, and actually all mental health disorders in general, i think this gets overlooked. that that last criteria, which is that like clinically significant distress and functional impairment, if the person likes it and they are not subjectively identifying any problems with their homes and yeah somebody from the outside is saying you need to do something, but they are not--so i guess if you have somebody saying, ""you're going to be evicted"" that is causing functional impairment and clinically significant distress because the state of their home is leading to them not having a residence, which then would cause distress and impairment. but if there wasn't, let's say they own their own home and the individual really does enjoy just having a lot of items around and there's some sort of safety or comfort that's associated with it and it's not actually getting in the way, like it's not impairing their ability to work or to be social or to do their hobbies or what have you, i think that that wouldn't be criteria for hoarding disorder."
2024,2024_370.txt,0,0.8211716413497925,"right, so i guess that leads us really nicely into the next part of the interview because in the kind of next question is, you know, for this last criteria the difficulty is due to a perceived need to save and distress associated with discarding, i wonder how that is a part of the problem of insight. so, how does that distress manifest in somebody who just doesn't have insight into their disorder and how do you make a judgement as to whether they're not meeting criteria for hoarding disorder because they're not distressed, versus they do have hoarding disorder but they just don't have insight into the disorder?","yeah, yeah, that's a good question, i mean that's pretty hard, that's a hard call to make. i think ultimately i would look at if there isn't the distress, the subjective distress, i guess trying to find like is there impairment, is there functional impairment related to that perceived need to save and the difficulty discarding. so, if the person isn't impacted, if it isn't interfering even if the person is saying it's not really stressful or causing distress, but is it interfering to a significant degree and trying to speak or talk to the person about that. like for example, one of the individuals i worked with who the county was threatening eviction, he didn't see any problem with his difficulty. he didn't experience distress, either related to that perceived need to save or the difficulty discarding. well he did, but he didn't subjectively identify that as a problem, and so he had decided that there was distress when he was deciding to get rid of things, so he would keep them, and the excessive acquisition brought pleasure for him or it was something that he enjoyed doing, so the only piece that led to the impairment was someone from the outside saying that he had a problem. but they had power so they were the one threatening eviction, and so then even though he didn't have insight into his disorder, he didn't have insight into the difficulty. it actually had caused a lot of problems with his relationships, like he was estranged from his whole family but he didn't have insight that the hoarding was a part of that really, and so really the only area--he did agree with the fact that yeah this is causing distress and i will be impaired if i don't have a home to live in, i won't be able to do anything if i don't have a home, and so at that point, the diagnosis was still warranted because of the situation and because of the distress around that."
2024,2024_371.txt,0,0.7984989881515503,"right, right. i'd like to quickly drill a little bit deeper into this concept of insight. so, as i'm sure you know, the literature surrounding hoarding disorder often describes hoarders as having low insight, and i'm wondering how you as a clinician define the term insight?","yeah, yeah that's a really good question. with insight i think how i determine insight is like the ability for an individual to recognize or yeah, to recognize that something is an issue or a problem, ultimately. so, this can come up in ocd a lot as well, you know, or this is actually another example that's related, like if someone is having relationship ocd or like is experiencing obsessions about their relationship, they might not see those thoughts as obsessive necessarily, because they might seem valid or warranted. like, ""oh this person's bothering me, maybe i sue this person, that's something that i should actually consider."" so, in that way a person with ocd might not recognize that that's actually ocd and we need to target that in treatment as ocd, and so if they're not going to conceptualize it as ocd, we can't do exposure therapy and we can't treat it in the way we treat other ocd symptoms. so it would be very similar with hoarding disorder, if someone is not seeing that the clutter is an issue and is not able to have insight into the way that it's impacting them, and i think that's ultimately what i think of insight, i think about there being a disconnect between like the consequences. like i guess not realizing or understanding the consequences of the behavior, so that an individual doesn't actually see their difficulty discarding as leading to relationship issues or leading to issues with them working or doing their hobbies. like there's that kind of lack of insight into the ways that the problems are impacting them, is kind of how i conceptualize it. i know that insight, and actually somebody on our team who's a psychiatrist and again i'm a psychologist, he approaches insight differently and i missed his talk but he was just talking about the brain structures and the ways that the research on insight in general on different psychiatric disorders and how the brain, you know, what circuits might be related to loss of insight or a lack of insight in different disorders."
2024,2024_372.txt,0,0.707258403301239,"interesting, interesting, it sounds like in your clinical practice most of the patients you see have fairly good insight, is that correct?","yeah, yeah, fairly good insight in that they're either aware that there's some issue, there's some desire to, there's something happening that's bothering the individual, whether it's, ""oh i'm trying to get my taxes done and i have all these medical bills and in order to do that, i have to be able to sort through all my papers and discharge and i need to learn how to do that because there's so much distress associated with it right now."" and so maybe there's not insight into all of the symptoms, or like a motivation to work on all of the domains in someone's life, but there might be in one area. so then we might work there and then we might work together to try to increase insight by just motivational interviewing type of technique. you know, i would never tell somebody that it's a problem, it's only a problem if it's a problem for that person, so it would just be highlighting some of the discrepancies that the individuals might bring up as related to the individual thinking its not a problem and just be kind of highlighting that it is a problem sometimes and having the person kind of sit with it not being a problem but it is a problem, like what does that mean? you know, and kind of talking to somebody to increase their insight would be something that we would do in therapy. but yeah, i think that on some level, most people that i see have some insight. the person that i worked with who had the least amount of insight, i think the reason the person was in treatment was because of the threat of evictions. those are the hardest cases, because the person has absolutely no insight into the fact that the behavior is problematic and that there is probably distress and impairment in their life, you know there probably isn't going to be any reason to try to fix or do anything differently."
2024,2024_372.txt,0,0.46289217472076416,"so it sounds like the patients that you see, they start gaining insight because there's some area in their life where they see this negative consequence, even if they don't see the whole picture, there's an eviction, or they're trying to do their taxes, or there's one thing or another that they feel is having a negative impact. and then your tactic is kind of to start there and to see if you can spread that self-knowledge to other domains that are also impacted. does that sound right?","yup, yup, exactly. and i think the other thing that goes into that is because most people don't seek treatment until like their 50s or like midlife, that if you think about the outcome of these symptoms that happen early, i think that one of the reasons is that it takes years for things to accumulate. like it takes years and years and years for a lot of these folks to actually acquire enough to actually compromise living space. so i think that by the time we're seeing folks things are pretty severe."
2024,2024_373.txt,0,0.7068476676940918,"yeah, so that was another question that i was going to ask you about, actually, you know because there does seem to be this disconnect that many people describe hoarding as starting at adolescence, but most hoarding patients, patients with hoarding disorder don't come into treatment until they're unfortunately middle aged or in middle age and i hear you saying that part of that is it takes them a while to acquire enough items to meet criteria. i wonder if you think that there could also be a social aspect to that trajectory, people's children moving out of their house or spouses either dying or leaving, do you feel like those social factors--or i mean, conversely, should we see hoarding perhaps as a progressive disorder that actually worsens with age? i wonder what your opinion is and where it kind of falls out.","yeah, yeah, you know anecdotally and from what we know, i think i tend to see it as more of a progressive disorder that tends to become exasperated or get worse over time, in general. i think that doesn't mean that that's always the case, though i think that's where more research is needed in terms of the role of like a traumatic experience. i mean there's some cases where someone maybe wasn't struggling with those symptoms at all and then they're 35 or 40 and then something happened, like a trauma might happen or some sort of stressful life event, and then they develop difficulties with the acquisition and discarding and the disorder comes from that. i think that happens less than what i know about the research, however it does happen. and so that is interesting how for some people it starts kind of insidiously at a young age and then just kind of progressively becomes exasperated, but for others it might not even be there until later in life and maybe a hypothesis is maybe some sort of event, stressor, trauma basically triggers a disorder for some personal reason. so i think that there might be a couple of ways that people can develop."
2024,2024_373.txt,0,0.2819242775440216,"mhhm, so it might just be later in life, yeah. i'd like to return really briefly just to the concept of insight. so there was this patient published about insight in hoarding disorder that broke the concept down into different constructs, and i'd just like to read you the constructs and see if you think any of them are more or less salient based on your clinical experience. so the construct of insight that the paper described were first defensiveness, second was anosognosia or just a lack of ability to perceive an illness or that something is wrong causing distress, the third one was overvalued ideation, which was defined as a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items that can range from mild to delusional in intensity, and the fourth one was indifference. so, again, we have defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideation, and indifference, and i wonder if when you encounter patients that are having problems with insight, if you find one of those to be more common or more important?","yeah, good question, what paper, would you mind? i'm just curious and--"
2024,2024_374.txt,0,0.37237799167633057,"yeah it was a paper i think it was by brandy frost and colleagues where they were examining these kinds of ideas, i can send it to you if you're interested in it.","yeah i would love to read that, yeah. okay i do have some thoughts about that. so, i think, i've thought a lot about overvalued ideation and the lack of an ability to perceive a problem, like just not seeing clutter as an issue or maybe not even being able to see the clutter, really or perceive that the space, to not be able to recognize the illness in that way i think that's kind of what we were talking a little bit about with insight before, that an individual just might not be able to see that there's a problem. and so i think that definitely comes up a lot, i've seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, i think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, i think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. i think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. i think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, i already kind of mentioned, ""there's a specific way i have to discard of this item and it's so important that i do this in a very specific way and if not i'm a bad person,"" for example. and that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn't discard in a specific kind of way, they're a bad person. so there's this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don't want to feel like a bad person. so i think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and i think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and ocd as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like ""my rituals are important, i need to do my checking because if not i might murder somebody and i don't want to be responsible for that."""
2024,2024_374.txt,0,0.45878809690475464,"so like, they're really convinced that they have to do it or some terrible thing is going to happen to them.","right, right, exactly, exactly, so there might be that same thing happening in hoarding disorder like, ""i am convinced that i'm a bad person because i just contributed to this plastic thing in the ocean and maybe that means that these thoughts will never leave me, that i'm always going to feel like a bad person and that doing anything differently will just result in me getting stuck with all these thoughts and all these negative feelings and i want to make sure i do it right."" and so a lot of times when we're doing like exposures for hoarding disorder, i think there is a bit of perfectionism in terms of overvalued ideation. there can be barriers to someone being willing to take a risk and throw away a plastic can in the trash and that can be something that someone is just not willing to do, and if that's the case then we can't do an exposure around it and we're kind of stuck, in a way, or we can become stuck if their overvalued ideation kind of prevents them from actually doing the exercises as related to the therapy."
2024,2024_375.txt,0,0.6948907375335693,"so i wonder, just to tease this out a little bit further, in both this idea of anosognosia or just not being able to perceive that the illness is a problem or even not being able to perceive the clutter, and also in overvalued ideation if you really believe that an item is valuable to the point that it's very unreasonable, that almost sounds like a little bit of a delusion kind of thing, you know. like really not being able to perceive reality in a concrete way, really believing strongly in that a piece of paper or an empty can are just super super valuable or looking at a space that is unusable and you can't even walk in and just seeing no clutter. and i don't know, i guess i just kind of want to check with you and see if that's what you see with your patients, this kind of like almost delusional like lack of touch with reality or is it somewhere in between?","yeah, yeah, i think it's a really good point and it's definitely come up within hoarding, it's come up with ocd. for example, like ocd can look sometimes like a psychotic disorder, for somebody endorsing some pretty strange beliefs and with some overvalued ideation around it that i think are the same thing, like you were mentioning with hoarding disorder like, ""i need to save this for this reason"" and there's this kind of fixed aspect to it, whereas it's just the way that it is, it's just right or wrong."
2024,2024_376.txt,0,0.4031825661659241,"mhhmm, that inflexibility.","yeah, so i think that does maybe overlap some. i think maybe the difference in hoarding disorder or anxiety disorder or ocd is that, at least from the folks i've seen, it's not as fixed i guess. the overvalued ideation is there, but there's like enough flexibility in most people to try things differently. unless there's like a comorbid ocpd or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. but i think if that isn't there and it's just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, i think i would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there's a lot of anxiety? that could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there's no arguing it. and with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there's no approaching it in any way shape or form. most people i've worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, ""oh yeah, i can see that's a strong value, i can see how i really think that i am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however i'm also seeing that if i do this this way, i'm never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, i'm never going to be able to do this if i do it 100% right all the time"" so maybe there's some flexibility that's incorporated, even though i still strongly believe that i want to be an environmentally conscious person and i want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that's where i would see there's like some flexibility and it's not completely like, ""i have to do it this way and we're not doing it any differently"" and i think that might be one piece that might help."
2024,2024_376.txt,0,0.4728009104728699,"okay, i want to acknowledge that we're definitely at an hour, i have three more questions for you, do you mind sticking with it for three more questions?","yeah, not at all, that's fine."
2024,2024_377.txt,0,0.7286158800125122,"yeah, so these are kind of broad level questions about big issues in hoarding disorder. so, there's this, we talked a little bit about cultural forces associating perhaps consumerism or environmentalism, i want to kind of explore that a little bit more, you know, do you feel like there's a relationship in the patients that you've seen between having had experiences of scarcity or poverty in the development of hoarding disorder?","mhhm, yeah, good question. you know, anecdotally, i have had a couple patients talk about that and talk about that when they were younger or not having, yeah not having food or not necessarily having what they need, and so ultimately wanting to and kind of learning not to waste, right, talking about that sort of idea of like i shouldn't waste anything because there was a time that i didn't have anything and maybe in the future i might not have anything. or like maybe something would happen, you know, like i'll need this and i'll be in hard times again. and actually one of the, like an interesting case example is, i can't remember his name, i think it was a chinese artist who's mother struggled with hoarding, one second i'm just gonna look up the name of it. oh, song dong, and so she was an artist and he grew up in china and his mother basically there was just like economic difficulties in china as he was--or as she was growing up, and so she learned basically to save and to not waste because of those difficulties, just in case that were to happen again. like it was just kind of a value that she learned because of what was happening in society and that was a big part of her difficulty. it was rooted in her experience as a child and not having what she needed. i've heard that form many patients and not everybody for sure, but definitely some and there was this idea that, ""i don't want that to ever happen again or at least i want to do what i can to prevent that from happening if i ever were in a situation where i didn't have what i needed."" i don't see that that often, but i have seen it a couple of times."
2024,2024_378.txt,0,0.6784675121307373,"yeah, kind of a related idea that there's been a little research about but not a ton is along the lines of kind of what you were talking about with sentimental value, and i'm wondering if you feel like there's a relationship between hoarding disorder and memory or patients' ideas about memories?","mhhm, yeah, good question. i think that a lot of patients believe that> i don't know, maybe for some it is the case that they do struggle with memory and maybe because of that executive function difficulty or problems, maybe there are some like cognitive developments. but i hear it a lot as just like a reason for keeping something, that ""if i don't have this reminder, this cue, i won't remember."" and i think i tend to challenge that in therapy, because i tend to ask people to test that out for themselves like are they sure they won't remember? what tells them they won't remember? are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? i think it's almost like this fear that they'll forget, it's like this fear of forgetting, like if i don't have this cue then i won't remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. however, for a lot of these folks, when we're doing exposures, for example, they'll come across things they haven't seen and, you know, 10 years. and so ultimately they're not actually using the items that are a cue to remember. so i might reflect that as well, like it sounds like, and maybe even asking somebody like, ""have you thought about that memory in the last 10 years even without the cue of the item?"" and i think that can be a way to get at whether or not they're actually INAUDIBLE or if they're difficulties with memory. i think that a lot of patients do believe, or that is a reason for why a lot of people have a perceived need to keep those items, is that they're fearful that they'll forget."
2024,2024_379.txt,0,0.7233449220657349,"so for this last question, this is again kind of like a conceptual question for you, we've talked a lot throughout the interview about reasons that people give for their hoarding behavior, and i'm wondering if for you, just in your own thinking about this disorder, if those reasons are true motivators or if they're kind of post hoc justifications for an underlying, perhaps, biological need. so, another way of asking this question might be to say, which comes first, the behavior and then they justify it by saying, ""oh the environment, oh i'm afraid of forgetting, oh i might use those"" or are the thoughts actually driving the behavior?","yeah, that's a really good question. of course that would be a great research question, i don't--yeah i think that's hard. i think that from what i've seen, people when they're acquiring or having difficulty discarding, it does seem to really ring true to their values of whatever those things are. so if it's someone who cares about the environment, it does seem like in the moment when we're doing an exposure, that that really is what's happening. that the act of discarding this will make the person feel anxiety and a part of that might also be that there's maybe a biological vulnerability or sensitivity, just like all anxiety disorders, and that learning component. so maybe i'm more vulnerable to feeling a need to acquire and also more vulnerable to want to keep things because i feel like i want to remember, maybe i'm more of a sentimental person. so there might be some distress associated with thinking about getting rid of something, and then as a solution there might be this avoiding discarding, right. like, ""oh i don't want to deal with that"" so maybe it's an anxiety sensitivity thing or an emotional sensitivity thing. like, i just feel more distressed than the average person when i think about discarding these things, so i avoid doing it. and maybe there might be some post hoc reasoning or rationalizing of it after the fact, so it might be a combination of the two. i think there very well could be, although i think in a way it's almost like the avoidance behavior of discarding leads to all the clutter, it's just kind of a way that people might learn to cope with the distress that's associated with the need to discard, given just the environment. like if someone had a huge home and all the money in the world, there wouldn't be as much of a need to go through and to discard things, and so that might be a different situation. but the fact is that most people do need to find things and have trouble finding things and so there might be behavioral reasons why people avoid or cope with that that kind of lead in the long term to this trap. you can avoid discarding things for a while, but ultimately if you think of a bathtub that doesn't have a drain, it's just eventually gonna overflow and then that's just going to become even more overwhelming. and so that behavior worked in the short-run, maybe they avoided feeling bad for a while, they avoided that distress and now we're in a situation that's maybe much worse. so in a way it's almost like, the way i look at or conceptualize it, the way i like to conceptualize all maladaptive behavioral responses to an emotional problem is just that it's a solution, for the moment, it's usually a short-term solution that someone comes up with, like it's either from anxiety like you'd see some avoidance behavior, you know, ""i'm just gonna avoid doing that or going to that place or looking through my items or discarding"" but that only provides short-term relief because at the end of the day, the distress is still there. the person still experiences distress when thinking about discarding, and then they haven't discarded for 20 years and now the problem is just so much worse that the distress is just exacerbated and increased. so that's the way i tend to conceptualize it, is that its their learned behavior based on that biological vulnerability or that biological kind of maybe anxiety sensitivity or emotion sensitivity as it relates to in this case hoarding, or acquisition and discarding."
2026,2026_381.txt,0,0.6007184386253357,"okay, perfect. well thank you for doing that with me, we're going to move into the more unstructured fun part of the interview. just to begin with just as we get into that, would you mind telling me a couple of sentences about your background related to hoarding disorder and how you encountered individuals with this disorder?","we started a program here at INSTITUTION in 2006, because we were seeing a lot of people who were losing their section 8 housing subsidies because of failed inspections caused by hoarding behavior. so we partnered with INSTITUTION and developed an evidence-based case management program for hoarding intervention to reduce the risk of housing loss due to hoarding behavior."
2026,2026_381.txt,0,0.5234980583190918,and what is your professional and educational background?,"my professional, i actually don't have an undergraduate degree, and my professional background initially was doing hiv/aids work in the mid 90's in north carolina, and then moving to boston and doing housing work as a community organizer around various housing issues. and then i started doing some work in our code department here at INSTITUTION and that's how we've sort of taken hoarding and i've decided there's gotta be a better way to address the issue and that's when we got some training through INSTITUTION and INSTITUTION."
2026,2026_381.txt,0,0.6472703218460083,"and are you involved in diagnosing people with hoarding disorder, treating them, or research or all of the above or none of the above?","so we don't do diagnosis. we're less worried about the mental health diagnosis, our goal is to provide case management intervention so that people aren't losing their homes. and so, if you think about treatment more broadly and less kind of clinically, you know i guess you could make an argument that that what we're doing, that our focus is not on the mental health side, it's on the social service intervention side. in addition to that, we've partnered with INSTITUTION to do some research because we have a very large data base of information that we've collected over the years, to better understand the problem of hoarding as we see it in the community so that we can have a better response in terms of housing stability and eviction prevention."
2026,2026_381.txt,0,0.46831685304641724,and how long have you worked with these individuals?,since 2006.
2026,2026_381.txt,0,0.7591888904571533,"so, now we're gonna talk a little bit about the diagnosis of hoarding and we have some questions, which we kind of use with clinicians but i'm really curious to your encounters with them and your ideas about them, so if you don't feel like these pertain particularly to you that's okay. the first one is kind of broad, so in your mind, what do you think are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps somebody who is a collector of items, and somebody with hoarding disorder?","good question, i think there are a couple of different things. i think that the volume of possessions certainly is one. you know, with collectors, generally speaking they're able to display things, you could still use the homes and the rooms, the spaces for their intended purpose and i think when we think about hoarding, that impairment of the ability to use the space and the real risk of it in terms of health, safety and well-being is a bigger factor, so i think that that's the big kind of difference there that we see."
2026,2026_382.txt,0,0.45823121070861816,so it's more about the home use itself and whether the person's space usage is impaired?,"yeah that's a big part of it, and you know i think the emotional attachment is different. i think for people with hoarding based on our experience, there's a lot of worry about what happens to the items if they're not being used, there's a lot of worry about the person collecting the items, their individual emotional and physical well-being if they didn't have the items, and so i think that that's also distinct form what you would see from a collector. it's a much more personalized attachment."
2026,2026_382.txt,0,0.48990389704704285,"so it sounds like there's two kind of main distinguishing factors for you. one is that unlike collecting, in individual with hoarding disorder's space will be kind of difficult or dangerous to use. and then the second one is that they'll have a much more kind of intense, maybe fear-based emotional response to their item? does that sound right?","yeah, along with, you know not just fear-based, but an inability to separate out their identity, potential identity, all of those kind of emotions from the physical objects themselves."
2026,2026_382.txt,0,0.6738700866699219,"and have you ever encountered a person where you were unsure if they truly had hoarding disorder? maybe a borderline case or a case that wasn't a usual, where you felt like you just weren't sure or you struggled whether this was what was really going on for the person?","um, not really. i mean, most of our cases are pretty straight-forward in terms of, you know, when people are talking about their stuff or what they worry about if they did get rid of their stuff, that in combination with the sheer volume of possessions that we see. i can't think of a case where we were unclear. certainly where we do run into issues is, and this is very different from looking at things clinically obviously, but we have folks who have other mental health issues such as schizophrenia or something like that. so sometimes for us, we're addressing the hoarding behaviors because that's what we're there for, but sometimes it's not clear, is the other mental health issue the primary factor, or is it the hoarding? and i think that's where it gets tricky and it's very different than how this would be clinically diagnosed."
2026,2026_382.txt,0,0.4511524736881256,and how do you deal with those situations?,"you know, in a lot of the situations we'll do more behavioral work, you know, we've got a partnership with our department of mental health, we work with a lot of their more challenging individuals who will do a lot of things like using blue painter's tape to create an egress path and working with the individuals to get them used to keeping that egress path clear and then reducing the height of piles and getting them used to doing that by using other visual cues. and so, we're much less focused in those situations on the cognitive side and are really primarily focused on using harm-reduction and the behavioral side of things."
2026,2026_383.txt,0,0.483342707157135,"and it sounds like maybe unlike a typical clinician, for you what's really important is making the person safe to live in the home and what's causing the behavior is almost less important than that. i mean if they have, for instance, obsessive compulsive disorder other than hoarding, if their house is full of stuff for you the primary thing to deal with is the house. does that sound right?","correct, you know and doing the work to teach them the skills so that they can maintain it moving forward. we have a very low recidivism rate because our approach is regardless of what might be going on, if there is a different diagnosis that would be clinically given, that's less what we're worried about. we're really worried about teaching them the skills so that they can not only reduce the volume of their housing, but maintain it moving forward."
2026,2026_383.txt,0,0.3525003492832184,"one of the things i asked you about in the listing portion of the interview was about how you could tell if somebody had hoarding disorder. i'm wondering if in your mind as somebody who works with these individuals a lot, there's kind of like a soft set of criteria or a typical description of a person with hoarding disorder? do you feel like if you were to describe a person with hoarding disorder without actually talking about their stuff, that like a cohesive description of that person would emerge? does that make sense as a question?","it does, and you know it would be so hard to do because all of our folks are really kind of different in terms of our, if you look at our data folks tend to be single, tend to be in their 50s or 60s, our folks have an average income of 13,000. that's because our program is primarily geared to work with lower income folks who are kind of most vulnerable around housing situations. but overall it's interesting because they're actually much better educated than our group in boston, which is a fairly well-educated population. so, you know, i think it's tough to make some generalities without kind of looking at their particular relationships with the stuff."
2026,2026_383.txt,0,0.6298554539680481,"i guess i'm, i don't know, sometimes when i ask for that list, even with clinicians i get this kind of very kind of personality-based description. you know, like somebody who's really scattered, who's very vivacious and talks a lot, and i'm wondering if that resonated with you as to the people that you see, that they kind of have this typical manner of being?","it's interesting because you say that and in some of the folks that description is very very accurate, and then there's a lot of folks where that wouldn't be accurate at all, that they're very kind of hyper-organized and very quiet or very exacting. and so, i would feel really uncomfortable actually making a generality."
2026,2026_383.txt,0,0.30136844515800476,"mhhm, that's exactly, yeah.",because we see such a wide range in terms of personalities. i think the thing that is much more consistent is the themes around why people hold onto their stuff.
2026,2026_384.txt,0,0.7311051487922668,"mhhm, interesting. so, now i have a couple of questions that deal with the specific diagnostic criteria, and i know that that's not really how you look at this problem, but i still want to kind of think through these issues with you. so, the first one is about value and when we talked about what distinguishes a person who has hoarding disorder from somebody who's a collector, you mentioned that the person with hoarding disorder their space will be much more kind of impacted and unusable, and i'm wondering if in your mind the value of the items saved is relevant to whether or not somebody has hoarding disorder? so, could you be a person with hoarding disorder who exclusively saves one kind of item in the same way a collector might? you know, like you can imagine somebody's house is totally filled with like cuckoo clocks to the point that they can't use it, but that's all they save.","yup, you know and i think one of the interesting things is that they've taken the definition has changed around hoarding over the years. you know, the language around the definition used to say, ""items that have little or no value,"" you know, but what we know is that people hoard all kinds of really nice stuff and really not nice stuff and i think a lot of it goes back to beauty is in the eye of the beholder. we certainly see people who hoard all of one thing, and sometimes it looks completely like trash to me and sometimes i can totally understand the value. i think when we think about value, i'm much more concerned about what's the value to the client that i'm working with, less about the finical value because we have people who hoard, you know the guy who has 15 or 20,0000 toothpaste caps, and for him they're extremely valuable, for me they would be trash. and so i think it's important that we as professionals are really careful about how we think about value."
2026,2026_384.txt,0,0.2896188199520111,"so, for you what's relevant really to telling if somebody has hoarding disorder is not what they're saving or how objectively valuable it is, more that their stuff is impairing their life. so, you could hoard valuable art and if your house was unusable, it would still be hoarding disorder.","yeah, for the most part."
2026,2026_384.txt,0,0.2626826763153076,"yeah, for the most part.","okay. another thing that has come out in these interviews has to do with the diagnostic criteria that reads, ""the difficulty discarding results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use."" and that seems to be what you're talking about in terms of the space kind of impairing the person's life. i'm wondering how you think about, and i'm sure this is something that you encounter, the fact that if you have less space, if you're living in a very small apartment for instance, it's much easier for your space to become congested and cluttered as opposed to somebody who lives in a huge mansion who has plenty of space, or somebody who can afford storage units. do you feel like it's easier for a person who has a small apartment to have hoarding disorder, or do you feel like that doesn't really play out that way?"
2026,2026_385.txt,0,0.6538522839546204,"would it be hypothetically possible to hoard items that don't take up space, such as somebody who has like thousands of digital books on their computer and has no more hard drive space and can't use their computer because they have--you know, i guess what i'm asking about is does it have to be space in the home? is that a necessary part of it?","you know, i think at least for right now, yes. you know, i could certainly see an argument about hoarding elsewhere, but that's where really the question becomes in what way is it impairing the individual's functioning in whatever part of their life? because without that impairment i don't really see how that's a disorder."
2026,2026_385.txt,0,0.6690606474876404,"so for you that comes back to impairment, and i guess when you're talking about impairment, how do you determine...so again, i could imagine a person making an argument that their kitchen use is not impaired because they don't cook, they don't use their stove, so the fact that they have huge piles of stuff on their stove isn't impairing to them because they would never use their stove anyway. so, when you're trying to determine if somebody is truly impaired, particularly in a disorder like this where people sometimes struggle with seeing the impairment, how do you make that determination?","i think that's where we have to look at, you know, there are a lot of different kinds of impairment. so, if somebody's not cooking but they've still got items on their stove, that's a fire hazard that could impair their health and safety if there were to be a fire. so just given what we know about how long it takes to intervene in hoarding-related fires, and so i think that people with hoarding may look very narrowly at impairment, while we're looking much more broadly at is this impacting your ability to carry out daily life activities? is it impacting your ability to remain safely housed? is it impacting your health and wellbeing overall in ways that the person might not necessarily see, given the disabling nature of hoarding."
2026,2026_386.txt,0,0.5804960131645203,"and when you think about the individuals you've encountered with this disorder, do you feel like it's more connected to the reasons that they give for saving individual items? or do you feel like there's a component that is about how they like their space. so, maybe patients might describe their space as being cozy, or needing to feel enclosed by items. how do you feel about that?","i think it depends on the person. we've heard both, sometimes in combination and sometimes not. and so i think it's tough because it's such an individualized set of reasons for why people save, right, and i think that that's part of the challenge. so, for some people it might be a feeling of safety, while for other people it might be more utilitarian."
2026,2026_386.txt,0,0.35951611399650574,"and when you talk to people and when you have talked to people about their reasons for this behavior, and this is totally subjective, this is 100% your opinion, do you feel like the reasons that people give for saving items are what's driving the behavior, or do you feel like the behavior comes first and then the person is kind of justifying the behavior by giving these reasons? does that make sense? is it more of an impulse that the person does, they save and then when you ask them why they give you a reason why? or is the reason really driving the behavior?","you know, that's a good question and i actually don't feel like i know the answer."
2026,2026_387.txt,0,0.6038225889205933,"okay. um, so one of the difficulties with this disorder in the long literature, and i'm sure you encounter it in your work and in your life all the time, is the problem of insight and one of the diagnostic criteria reads, ""the difficulty discarding is due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discarding,"" and i'm wondering how you think about distress in this context, when people will often deny that they are distressed by kind of the state of their home and they may also deny that they would be distressed if they had to discard their items? so how do you think about that? how do you think about the way that that distress fits into this diagnosis?","you know, when we're talking about most of our clients don't have a whole lot of insight, right, so they're like ""no everything's fine."" you know, what we often try to do is get them talking about the way the stuff isn't actually working for them, whether it's about housing or they can't find their remote or they're tripping. and so, for us often the distress is apparent even if it's not apparent to them and so a lot of time our work is really focused on how do we get them talking about the ways that maybe things aren't going as well as they are telling themselves they are because to some degree i think that saying that everything's really okay it's not a big deal is a great way to have to avoid the reality that maybe things actually aren't as good are they are, or as they seem. and so, i think that that for us a lot of times it's we see the distress and we see the impairment in functioning whether it's distress by the individual or someone else and so a lot of times for us it's really having the conversation and getting them to articulate how stuff's not working so well--even if we're doing it in a way that's not directly saying, ""well i don't think this is working so well."" it's really kind of saying, ""you know it sounds like on the one hand stuff is feeling great, and on the other hand you lost your keys or you can't find your medication"" or kind of tell them more about the ways this stuff isn't going the way you'd like it to."
2026,2026_387.txt,0,0.2898337244987488,"so it sounds like a major task for you, with a person with hoarding disorder, is helping them to experience or to see their own distress.",yeah.
2026,2026_387.txt,0,0.5854328274726868,"so, kind of to turn the conversation towards that problem with insight, how do you define insight or low insight in this context? what does having insight mean for a person with hoarding disorder?","you know like with everything else, i think that depends on the person. sometimes it can be understanding that they've got the problem and why that may be, sometimes significant change in insight for someone might be acknowledging that they can see why another person might see and issue, even if they are not ready to admit it but they're ready to do something to at least start making somebody else happy and then kind of finding their own ways. you know, so a lot of our work is getting people to go from ""there's no problem, why is everybody picking on me?"" to ""okay well maybe there's an issue."""
2026,2026_388.txt,0,0.49161192774772644,"so there was this interesting paper that randy frost published which broke the concept of insight down into different constructs, and i'd just like to read them to you and have you comment on how you encounter these different sorts of insight, if you think that some are more relevant than others? so the first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia, which is where you're unable to even perceive your illness or that anything is wrong or causing you distress, the third one is overvalued ideation, and that's kind of believing that your items are more valuable than they truly are, and the last one is indifference. do any of these, all of these seem like they're relevant for your patients? is there one that you think is more important or less important?","i certainly think the defensiveness is the one that resonates the most. that's something we just see day in and day out, even from folks that are willing to work with us and i think a lot of it seems to come from the fear that we're not gonna understand their stuff or value their stuff and that we're gonna judge them. they know that the system overall can be very punitive, and so what we find is once we make it clear that we're not gonna take their stuff because that's not our role, or tell them what to do, that they have control of their stuff no matter what, the defensiveness seems to break down. a lot of it really seems to be very fear-based."
2026,2026_388.txt,0,0.565891683101654,"um, when you encounter people who have this disorder and have very low insight, would you say that they truly don't know that there's anything different about them or their lives than other people? that they're truly bling to the fact that they have something about them that's different? or is it more that they don't acknowledge that that difference is a problem?","it feels like they know that not everybody else sees their stuff in their situation the way that they do, and aren't able to see the reasons that that might be a problem. i don't think it's willful disobedience or willful avoidance in most cases, but in some cases sometimes it might be. you know, i think a lot of it is all centered around perception and ability to kind of do the analysis that is required to have accurate perception."
2026,2026_388.txt,0,0.5218560099601746,"so would you say that when one of those individuals looks at their space, that they can't see how cluttered it is? that they see a normal space, even when it's clearly not normal?","well normal for them at least. you know, i think they can't see the health and safety issues and the volume in the same way that the rest of us would see."
2026,2026_388.txt,0,0.5428012609481812,and do you feel like that's just because they're so used to it or do you feel like that's almost in the level of like a delusion?,"i think it's hard for me to know sometimes. there are certainly some people where they just do not see it, and then there are some people where they might say, ""oh it's a little bit messy but it's not that bad."" as we're looking at something that's fairly severe. and so, you know, i generally don't think that it's avoidance as much as it is sometimes it feels like the brain's not giving them accurate data to work with."
2026,2026_389.txt,0,0.32532066106796265,"mhhm, and do you feel--i'm assuming that you've encountered also individuals that have problems with animal hoarding, because of your role. is that correct?",right.
2026,2026_389.txt,0,0.47984498739242554,do you feel like that's different for those individuals?,"you know, we don't have that many cases that come across every year so it's sort of hard to tell."
2026,2026_389.txt,0,0.2510496973991394,okay.,"there's certainly a different level of attachment to the animals and an inability, when there's poor animal care, to be able to see it that feels a little bit different from object hoarding, but certainly that's not...again, we don't see that many so it's sort of hard for me to say."
2026,2026_389.txt,0,0.5192682147026062,"when you think about the individuals that you've encountered with this disorder, do you have any sense for how long the behavior's been going on before you see them?","certainly for most of our folks, decades. you know, dating back to late teens, early twenties."
2026,2026_389.txt,0,0.5652663707733154,"and i guess just as you encounter these individuals, do you think that it's like a progressive illness that gets worse with age, or do you see it more as a set of circumstances? so like, as a person ages they naturally become more socially isolates, their children might leave home, they might inherit things from their parents, they might have a fixed income, and that those are the things that make it get worse as they get older?","you know, we're not seeing people who are going out and actively acquiring all the time later in life, especially since they're frail, it feels like it's more of a, when you think about how much stuff builds up over a course of decades if you're not able to get rid of it, either through active acquiring or through things like junk mail that just come into our lives, it feels like it's more of a slow slide off of a slippery slope than anything else. it just kind of builds up and builds up and builds up."
2026,2026_389.txt,0,0.3947342336177826,"so, maybe it's more that the stuff has built up rather than the behavior has gotten recently worse?",correct.
2026,2026_389.txt,0,0.6007184386253357,"okay, perfect. well thank you for doing that with me, we're going to move into the more unstructured fun part of the interview. just to begin with just as we get into that, would you mind telling me a couple of sentences about your background related to hoarding disorder and how you encountered individuals with this disorder?","we started a program here at INSTITUTION in 2006, because we were seeing a lot of people who were losing their section 8 housing subsidies because of failed inspections caused by hoarding behavior. so we partnered with INSTITUTION and developed an evidence-based case management program for hoarding intervention to reduce the risk of housing loss due to hoarding behavior."
2026,2026_389.txt,0,0.5234980583190918,and what is your professional and educational background?,"my professional, i actually don't have an undergraduate degree, and my professional background initially was doing hiv/aids work in the mid 90's in north carolina, and then moving to boston and doing housing work as a community organizer around various housing issues. and then i started doing some work in our code department here at INSTITUTION and that's how we've sort of taken hoarding and i've decided there's gotta be a better way to address the issue and that's when we got some training through INSTITUTION and INSTITUTION."
2026,2026_390.txt,0,0.6472703218460083,"and are you involved in diagnosing people with hoarding disorder, treating them, or research or all of the above or none of the above?","so we don't do diagnosis. we're less worried about the mental health diagnosis, our goal is to provide case management intervention so that people aren't losing their homes. and so, if you think about treatment more broadly and less kind of clinically, you know i guess you could make an argument that that what we're doing, that our focus is not on the mental health side, it's on the social service intervention side. in addition to that, we've partnered with INSTITUTION to do some research because we have a very large data base of information that we've collected over the years, to better understand the problem of hoarding as we see it in the community so that we can have a better response in terms of housing stability and eviction prevention."
2026,2026_390.txt,0,0.46831685304641724,and how long have you worked with these individuals?,since 2006.
2026,2026_390.txt,0,0.7591888904571533,"so, now we're gonna talk a little bit about the diagnosis of hoarding and we have some questions, which we kind of use with clinicians but i'm really curious to your encounters with them and your ideas about them, so if you don't feel like these pertain particularly to you that's okay. the first one is kind of broad, so in your mind, what do you think are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps somebody who is a collector of items, and somebody with hoarding disorder?","good question, i think there are a couple of different things. i think that the volume of possessions certainly is one. you know, with collectors, generally speaking they're able to display things, you could still use the homes and the rooms, the spaces for their intended purpose and i think when we think about hoarding, that impairment of the ability to use the space and the real risk of it in terms of health, safety and well-being is a bigger factor, so i think that that's the big kind of difference there that we see."
2026,2026_390.txt,0,0.45823121070861816,so it's more about the home use itself and whether the person's space usage is impaired?,"yeah that's a big part of it, and you know i think the emotional attachment is different. i think for people with hoarding based on our experience, there's a lot of worry about what happens to the items if they're not being used, there's a lot of worry about the person collecting the items, their individual emotional and physical well-being if they didn't have the items, and so i think that that's also distinct form what you would see from a collector. it's a much more personalized attachment."
2026,2026_390.txt,0,0.48990389704704285,"so it sounds like there's two kind of main distinguishing factors for you. one is that unlike collecting, in individual with hoarding disorder's space will be kind of difficult or dangerous to use. and then the second one is that they'll have a much more kind of intense, maybe fear-based emotional response to their item? does that sound right?","yeah, along with, you know not just fear-based, but an inability to separate out their identity, potential identity, all of those kind of emotions from the physical objects themselves."
2026,2026_391.txt,0,0.6738700866699219,"and have you ever encountered a person where you were unsure if they truly had hoarding disorder? maybe a borderline case or a case that wasn't a usual, where you felt like you just weren't sure or you struggled whether this was what was really going on for the person?","um, not really. i mean, most of our cases are pretty straight-forward in terms of, you know, when people are talking about their stuff or what they worry about if they did get rid of their stuff, that in combination with the sheer volume of possessions that we see. i can't think of a case where we were unclear. certainly where we do run into issues is, and this is very different from looking at things clinically obviously, but we have folks who have other mental health issues such as schizophrenia or something like that. so sometimes for us, we're addressing the hoarding behaviors because that's what we're there for, but sometimes it's not clear, is the other mental health issue the primary factor, or is it the hoarding? and i think that's where it gets tricky and it's very different than how this would be clinically diagnosed."
2026,2026_391.txt,0,0.4511524736881256,and how do you deal with those situations?,"you know, in a lot of the situations we'll do more behavioral work, you know, we've got a partnership with our department of mental health, we work with a lot of their more challenging individuals who will do a lot of things like using blue painter's tape to create an egress path and working with the individuals to get them used to keeping that egress path clear and then reducing the height of piles and getting them used to doing that by using other visual cues. and so, we're much less focused in those situations on the cognitive side and are really primarily focused on using harm-reduction and the behavioral side of things."
2026,2026_391.txt,0,0.483342707157135,"and it sounds like maybe unlike a typical clinician, for you what's really important is making the person safe to live in the home and what's causing the behavior is almost less important than that. i mean if they have, for instance, obsessive compulsive disorder other than hoarding, if their house is full of stuff for you the primary thing to deal with is the house. does that sound right?","correct, you know and doing the work to teach them the skills so that they can maintain it moving forward. we have a very low recidivism rate because our approach is regardless of what might be going on, if there is a different diagnosis that would be clinically given, that's less what we're worried about. we're really worried about teaching them the skills so that they can not only reduce the volume of their housing, but maintain it moving forward."
2026,2026_392.txt,0,0.3525003492832184,"one of the things i asked you about in the listing portion of the interview was about how you could tell if somebody had hoarding disorder. i'm wondering if in your mind as somebody who works with these individuals a lot, there's kind of like a soft set of criteria or a typical description of a person with hoarding disorder? do you feel like if you were to describe a person with hoarding disorder without actually talking about their stuff, that like a cohesive description of that person would emerge? does that make sense as a question?","it does, and you know it would be so hard to do because all of our folks are really kind of different in terms of our, if you look at our data folks tend to be single, tend to be in their 50s or 60s, our folks have an average income of 13,000. that's because our program is primarily geared to work with lower income folks who are kind of most vulnerable around housing situations. but overall it's interesting because they're actually much better educated than our group in boston, which is a fairly well-educated population. so, you know, i think it's tough to make some generalities without kind of looking at their particular relationships with the stuff."
2026,2026_392.txt,0,0.6298554539680481,"i guess i'm, i don't know, sometimes when i ask for that list, even with clinicians i get this kind of very kind of personality-based description. you know, like somebody who's really scattered, who's very vivacious and talks a lot, and i'm wondering if that resonated with you as to the people that you see, that they kind of have this typical manner of being?","it's interesting because you say that and in some of the folks that description is very very accurate, and then there's a lot of folks where that wouldn't be accurate at all, that they're very kind of hyper-organized and very quiet or very exacting. and so, i would feel really uncomfortable actually making a generality."
2026,2026_392.txt,0,0.30136844515800476,"mhhm, that's exactly, yeah.",because we see such a wide range in terms of personalities. i think the thing that is much more consistent is the themes around why people hold onto their stuff.
2026,2026_393.txt,0,0.7311051487922668,"mhhm, interesting. so, now i have a couple of questions that deal with the specific diagnostic criteria, and i know that that's not really how you look at this problem, but i still want to kind of think through these issues with you. so, the first one is about value and when we talked about what distinguishes a person who has hoarding disorder from somebody who's a collector, you mentioned that the person with hoarding disorder their space will be much more kind of impacted and unusable, and i'm wondering if in your mind the value of the items saved is relevant to whether or not somebody has hoarding disorder? so, could you be a person with hoarding disorder who exclusively saves one kind of item in the same way a collector might? you know, like you can imagine somebody's house is totally filled with like cuckoo clocks to the point that they can't use it, but that's all they save.","yup, you know and i think one of the interesting things is that they've taken the definition has changed around hoarding over the years. you know, the language around the definition used to say, ""items that have little or no value,"" you know, but what we know is that people hoard all kinds of really nice stuff and really not nice stuff and i think a lot of it goes back to beauty is in the eye of the beholder. we certainly see people who hoard all of one thing, and sometimes it looks completely like trash to me and sometimes i can totally understand the value. i think when we think about value, i'm much more concerned about what's the value to the client that i'm working with, less about the finical value because we have people who hoard, you know the guy who has 15 or 20,0000 toothpaste caps, and for him they're extremely valuable, for me they would be trash. and so i think it's important that we as professionals are really careful about how we think about value."
2026,2026_393.txt,0,0.2896188199520111,"so, for you what's relevant really to telling if somebody has hoarding disorder is not what they're saving or how objectively valuable it is, more that their stuff is impairing their life. so, you could hoard valuable art and if your house was unusable, it would still be hoarding disorder.","yeah, for the most part."
2026,2026_393.txt,0,0.2626826763153076,"yeah, for the most part.","okay. another thing that has come out in these interviews has to do with the diagnostic criteria that reads, ""the difficulty discarding results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use."" and that seems to be what you're talking about in terms of the space kind of impairing the person's life. i'm wondering how you think about, and i'm sure this is something that you encounter, the fact that if you have less space, if you're living in a very small apartment for instance, it's much easier for your space to become congested and cluttered as opposed to somebody who lives in a huge mansion who has plenty of space, or somebody who can afford storage units. do you feel like it's easier for a person who has a small apartment to have hoarding disorder, or do you feel like that doesn't really play out that way?"
2026,2026_394.txt,0,0.6538522839546204,"would it be hypothetically possible to hoard items that don't take up space, such as somebody who has like thousands of digital books on their computer and has no more hard drive space and can't use their computer because they have--you know, i guess what i'm asking about is does it have to be space in the home? is that a necessary part of it?","you know, i think at least for right now, yes. you know, i could certainly see an argument about hoarding elsewhere, but that's where really the question becomes in what way is it impairing the individual's functioning in whatever part of their life? because without that impairment i don't really see how that's a disorder."
2026,2026_394.txt,0,0.6690606474876404,"so for you that comes back to impairment, and i guess when you're talking about impairment, how do you determine...so again, i could imagine a person making an argument that their kitchen use is not impaired because they don't cook, they don't use their stove, so the fact that they have huge piles of stuff on their stove isn't impairing to them because they would never use their stove anyway. so, when you're trying to determine if somebody is truly impaired, particularly in a disorder like this where people sometimes struggle with seeing the impairment, how do you make that determination?","i think that's where we have to look at, you know, there are a lot of different kinds of impairment. so, if somebody's not cooking but they've still got items on their stove, that's a fire hazard that could impair their health and safety if there were to be a fire. so just given what we know about how long it takes to intervene in hoarding-related fires, and so i think that people with hoarding may look very narrowly at impairment, while we're looking much more broadly at is this impacting your ability to carry out daily life activities? is it impacting your ability to remain safely housed? is it impacting your health and wellbeing overall in ways that the person might not necessarily see, given the disabling nature of hoarding."
2026,2026_395.txt,0,0.5804960131645203,"and when you think about the individuals you've encountered with this disorder, do you feel like it's more connected to the reasons that they give for saving individual items? or do you feel like there's a component that is about how they like their space. so, maybe patients might describe their space as being cozy, or needing to feel enclosed by items. how do you feel about that?","i think it depends on the person. we've heard both, sometimes in combination and sometimes not. and so i think it's tough because it's such an individualized set of reasons for why people save, right, and i think that that's part of the challenge. so, for some people it might be a feeling of safety, while for other people it might be more utilitarian."
2026,2026_395.txt,0,0.35951611399650574,"and when you talk to people and when you have talked to people about their reasons for this behavior, and this is totally subjective, this is 100% your opinion, do you feel like the reasons that people give for saving items are what's driving the behavior, or do you feel like the behavior comes first and then the person is kind of justifying the behavior by giving these reasons? does that make sense? is it more of an impulse that the person does, they save and then when you ask them why they give you a reason why? or is the reason really driving the behavior?","you know, that's a good question and i actually don't feel like i know the answer."
2026,2026_396.txt,0,0.6038225889205933,"okay. um, so one of the difficulties with this disorder in the long literature, and i'm sure you encounter it in your work and in your life all the time, is the problem of insight and one of the diagnostic criteria reads, ""the difficulty discarding is due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discarding,"" and i'm wondering how you think about distress in this context, when people will often deny that they are distressed by kind of the state of their home and they may also deny that they would be distressed if they had to discard their items? so how do you think about that? how do you think about the way that that distress fits into this diagnosis?","you know, when we're talking about most of our clients don't have a whole lot of insight, right, so they're like ""no everything's fine."" you know, what we often try to do is get them talking about the way the stuff isn't actually working for them, whether it's about housing or they can't find their remote or they're tripping. and so, for us often the distress is apparent even if it's not apparent to them and so a lot of time our work is really focused on how do we get them talking about the ways that maybe things aren't going as well as they are telling themselves they are because to some degree i think that saying that everything's really okay it's not a big deal is a great way to have to avoid the reality that maybe things actually aren't as good are they are, or as they seem. and so, i think that that for us a lot of times it's we see the distress and we see the impairment in functioning whether it's distress by the individual or someone else and so a lot of times for us it's really having the conversation and getting them to articulate how stuff's not working so well--even if we're doing it in a way that's not directly saying, ""well i don't think this is working so well."" it's really kind of saying, ""you know it sounds like on the one hand stuff is feeling great, and on the other hand you lost your keys or you can't find your medication"" or kind of tell them more about the ways this stuff isn't going the way you'd like it to."
2026,2026_396.txt,0,0.2898337244987488,"so it sounds like a major task for you, with a person with hoarding disorder, is helping them to experience or to see their own distress.",yeah.
2026,2026_396.txt,0,0.5854328274726868,"so, kind of to turn the conversation towards that problem with insight, how do you define insight or low insight in this context? what does having insight mean for a person with hoarding disorder?","you know like with everything else, i think that depends on the person. sometimes it can be understanding that they've got the problem and why that may be, sometimes significant change in insight for someone might be acknowledging that they can see why another person might see and issue, even if they are not ready to admit it but they're ready to do something to at least start making somebody else happy and then kind of finding their own ways. you know, so a lot of our work is getting people to go from ""there's no problem, why is everybody picking on me?"" to ""okay well maybe there's an issue."""
2026,2026_397.txt,0,0.49161192774772644,"so there was this interesting paper that randy frost published which broke the concept of insight down into different constructs, and i'd just like to read them to you and have you comment on how you encounter these different sorts of insight, if you think that some are more relevant than others? so the first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia, which is where you're unable to even perceive your illness or that anything is wrong or causing you distress, the third one is overvalued ideation, and that's kind of believing that your items are more valuable than they truly are, and the last one is indifference. do any of these, all of these seem like they're relevant for your patients? is there one that you think is more important or less important?","i certainly think the defensiveness is the one that resonates the most. that's something we just see day in and day out, even from folks that are willing to work with us and i think a lot of it seems to come from the fear that we're not gonna understand their stuff or value their stuff and that we're gonna judge them. they know that the system overall can be very punitive, and so what we find is once we make it clear that we're not gonna take their stuff because that's not our role, or tell them what to do, that they have control of their stuff no matter what, the defensiveness seems to break down. a lot of it really seems to be very fear-based."
2026,2026_397.txt,0,0.565891683101654,"um, when you encounter people who have this disorder and have very low insight, would you say that they truly don't know that there's anything different about them or their lives than other people? that they're truly bling to the fact that they have something about them that's different? or is it more that they don't acknowledge that that difference is a problem?","it feels like they know that not everybody else sees their stuff in their situation the way that they do, and aren't able to see the reasons that that might be a problem. i don't think it's willful disobedience or willful avoidance in most cases, but in some cases sometimes it might be. you know, i think a lot of it is all centered around perception and ability to kind of do the analysis that is required to have accurate perception."
2026,2026_397.txt,0,0.5218560099601746,"so would you say that when one of those individuals looks at their space, that they can't see how cluttered it is? that they see a normal space, even when it's clearly not normal?","well normal for them at least. you know, i think they can't see the health and safety issues and the volume in the same way that the rest of us would see."
2026,2026_397.txt,0,0.5428012609481812,and do you feel like that's just because they're so used to it or do you feel like that's almost in the level of like a delusion?,"i think it's hard for me to know sometimes. there are certainly some people where they just do not see it, and then there are some people where they might say, ""oh it's a little bit messy but it's not that bad."" as we're looking at something that's fairly severe. and so, you know, i generally don't think that it's avoidance as much as it is sometimes it feels like the brain's not giving them accurate data to work with."

3001,3001_005.txt,0,0.3939356207847595,so the audience would be 10-16 year olds to start with and the parents as well.,oh ok yeah
3001,3001_005.txt,0,0.46859297156333923,yeah,well i don’t know i would probably do two separate ones you know

3001,3001_006.txt,0,0.5970233082771301,would it be parents?,it would be their perspectives and what they’ve gone through and… what their involvements are going to be so they can speak with the parents you know.

3001,3001_026.txt,0,0.6608443856239319,alright and should the characters in the video ask about what parents can and can’t do to help?,"i would say yes, but again, this kind of depends on are you just going to make one video that’s going to address, like i was talking about, you can have a video that addresses a kid a parent can obviously watch that, but you could also have a video that maybe is inclusive to the parents prior to them coming here that does tell them what they should be expected, or what they should be expecting to see, and what they should be expecting to do to help their kid."
3001,3001_026.txt,0,0.6827057003974915,"but before i do that, let me ask you, are there any cartoons or animated videos or movies that you like, that catches your interest… your favorite ones to watch?",animated… you did say animated…

3001,3001_027.txt,0,0.3673185408115387,and what did you say about option 3?,i can see definitely more high school and maybe like eighth grade.

3001,3001_030.txt,0,0.4734230041503906,"07: 27mmh yeah so really like the method, the process was what was confusing.","i do have to say that learning the breathing techniques at first, or actually for a while and for some people, i know it was very strange so i’ve been through dbt as well and um some people i remember just seemed to think that it was just more buddhist type of an activity and i know i also sort of thought that as well because some of the… if you say the word meditation if you are talking to kids from strong interviewer background, people who do still go to church although it seems like we are dwindling group um, it’s a little put offish in way."
3001,3001_030.txt,0,0.38523563742637634,so being patient and knowing that it truly is a goal-oriented type practice.,yeah

3001,3001_030.txt,0,0.5909402370452881,take your time,"calmness, reframing… all i can think about are sentences um… i can’t think of another word."
3001,3001_030.txt,0,0.41212743520736694,"so for each of those words if you had to add a picture to them calmness, reframing, mindfulness, or being in the moment what would they look like?",i would think that would differ for each person.
3001,3001_030.txt,0,0.42127662897109985,what would that look like?,so reframing would be like i have a memory of an event that happened and i think of it almost has my… it’s complicated but i. um so reframing would be me having my opinion about based on limited information at the time when i was a child and having the therapist or the psychologist ask me what would have happened if my mom had taken me somewhere else..
3001,3001_030.txt,0,0.43862491846084595,so kind of like presenting a hypothetical.,yeah yeah and it makes you go back.
3001,3001_031.txt,0,0.453005313873291,"yeah, so would you say maybe a picture that could be associated with the reframing would be someone sitting with a therapist or someone  ___ showing support or","yes, showing support um helping them to realize that there is more than one choice."
3001,3001_031.txt,0,0.5257724523544312,"so the goal of cbt many times is to reduce anxiety, so if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in one’s life what would you say it looks like?",um having lived with it all of my life it is a little hard to say but anxiety would be someone talking to fast or doing too many things and not necessarily doing them well or not finishing them.
3001,3001_031.txt,0,0.529227614402771,yeah and um what’s important for other patients to know?,about
3001,3001_031.txt,0,0.6371273994445801,about,anxiety
3001,3001_031.txt,0,0.4876629412174225,how anxiety can become a problem in someone’s life or um what’s important to know just for someone who is experiencing those things?,its ok for you to get help.
3001,3001_031.txt,0,0.5023849010467529,"i know we talked about anxiety, but is there anything else that comes to mind.",depression.
3001,3001_031.txt,0,0.4497873783111572,yeah definitely and so would you say that it targets thoughts feelings and actions.,yes
3001,3001_032.txt,0,0.717757523059845,and are there any questions you wished you would have asked before you started cbt or your daughter?,no i before... i was going through cbt before either of my kids started and i kind of landed to it not really knowing what it was and it’s probably what has saved my life.
3001,3001_032.txt,0,0.3697003126144409,so would you say before starting it was really you… your question is what is this because you were going into not really knowing what to expect.,i interviewed several therapists and counselors beforehand and at the time i was faculty at uf.
3001,3001_032.txt,0,0.6411770582199097,and what is your involvement in your child’s overall cbt therapy?,so her counselor or her psychologist lately like for the last several visits has invited me into the sessions maybe for 10-15 minutes to let her know what i think should be covered because sometimes my daughter forgets mention certain things or just flat out doesn’t want to talk about it.
3001,3001_032.txt,0,0.4750220775604248,awesome and what would be useful for other parents to know that maybe have a child that is about to go into cbt or is in cbt?,be patient.
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.4221375584602356,to be patient and stuff like that.,and if they have concerns that the therapist needs to know about to make sure that they are not afraid to talk to the therapist or you know to just you know touch them on the shoulder or something and say can i talk to for just a minute.
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.784562349319458,"and have you read or heard any scientific research that has mentions cbt, and if so or if not do you think this something useful for us to mention in our videos?",research on cbt.
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.6084153652191162,yeah,that’s always useful.
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.48233187198638916,yeah definitely and did you know about anybody else’s experiences of cbt any time in your life?,no
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.4689025282859802,"no, ok",i only… i landed into cbt myself actually because i voluntarily went to vista for three days.
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.6640396118164062,what characters do you think we should include?,what ages groups are you targeting?
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.5252737402915955,"so as of right now we are trying to make the video appeal to both the patients and their family so pretty much all age groups, but um yeah.",and is it just one video?
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.5585198402404785,as of right now.,um and at what point where would you being showing it?
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.4088827967643738,so ideally we would like… i mean it would be something that would be shown to patients and families right before they would start treatment to kind of better understand what they are going to be doing.,so not like a public service announcement type of thing.
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.7746652960777283,um no more so targeting people who are going into cbt.,ok so an introduction to cbt.
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.5109451413154602,"probably something pretty concise, but enough information so people know what to expect.",so remind me your question.
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.542078971862793,who would be in the video?,oh boy!
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.8903861045837402,um yeah,yeah
3001,3001_033.txt,0,0.4518805742263794,yeah i would say yeah.,because… so my daughter sometimes plays games with my daughter.
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.5585706233978271,"what about nonhuman characters, animals, superheroes, do you think any of those would be appealing?","well there are... ok so your mascot almost, sort of."
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.30469977855682373,it could just i mean for the superheroes that would just be another way to represent things.,36:4oyeah
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.3435799479484558,"if you don’t think that superheroes, animals, nonhumans should be involved  ___.",i know a lot of times they are effective marketing tools.
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.4757853150367737,"yeah, so really just the people that are really involved in the process like the kids, the parents, the therapist and stuff like that.",yeah… i don’t know if you would…teachers don’t usually get involved in?
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.4803048074245453,"sometimes, it depends.",i don’t know if i would include anything outside of nuclear family or grandparents.
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.42961588501930237,um so what about where they would talk… what would be a good setting for the video or multiple settings?,um i’m a realist so you know to set the standard.
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.39240261912345886,yeah,i probably would not do one where there’s a two-way mirror involved because that is that would make anybody feel uncomfortable so.
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.3575829267501831,so really just like the therapist office would be the best setting.,yeah because you don’t want to sugarcoat it.
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.6468154788017273,yeah,so i don’t know.
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.41811972856521606,what should be talked about in the videos and should there be specific questions asked and addressed in the videos?,i would ask the counselors or the psychologists that one.
3001,3001_034.txt,0,0.34603047370910645,yeah,"um if they are working, um…you know if you are talking about the adults being the patients um and not just the parents um… is that part of the scope or is it?"
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.3986007273197174,it’s more so the perspective of the child as the patient but the parents are still involved.,"ok… so um you know if they have a lovey animal, you know a little lovey animal or a stuff animal that they bring with them you know, if it’s not too corny you can ask how the lovey is doing or the stuff animal so."
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.5932337641716003,"yeah, and should they ask about how it worked for other kids?",how who should ask?
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.46829313039779663,like should that a be like a question between maybe characters or should it be in the form of kind of a little snippet of an interview of kids explaining how its worked for them.,i’m not completely sure they know what method is being used on them and i’m not quite sure it’s necessary that they know.
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.4514695107936859,"do you think that there should be kids saying those things like its helped them, the feel better, and things of that sort?",yeah
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.42107871174812317,what about how exposures work?,um i don’t think my daughter has done that.
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.3417210280895233,ok.,i guess exposure to me in my situation means that uh they… like my counselor is uh just incredibly good.
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.6109941601753235,"um, kind of, so the first thing we’re wondering is what comes to mind when you guys think of cbt?","um, for me i would say that cbt is kind of a learning process of how to take some kind of behavior that is not quite acceptable or something that you want to work on and baby steps and step it to a place where you rather prefer it to be to get to an end point."
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.41594642400741577,right.,i took it as helping you stop a behavior that you have trouble stopping yourself.
3001,3001_035.txt,0,0.6888922452926636,"could you tell me what you guys know about cbt, so like, in your own words how would you explain it?","um, for me cbt is a process of physical and or mental challenges to train yourself brain-wise to get to a place behavioral-wise, so you’re trying in a way to shift your brain to make your brain and your body do correct behavior so that you’re a happier brain person."
3001,3001_036.txt,0,0.4616718590259552,"and um, you know, when you guys first came here and were learning about what kind of therapy we do here, do you remember what questions you had or maybe what you were feeling or thinking at that point about cbt?","well, i mean, the time table would be one you know, what is the length of time, they think, my daughter would need to go through the therapy."
3001,3001_036.txt,0,0.3643803894519806,sorry,"i just wanted to say, you i was trying to recall, you know how i was feeling with it, my daughter’s need for therapy rose, i think, fairly quickly and sense of panic, i think, on our part sort of not understanding how it kicked in for her and this feeling of a little bit of helplessness and um trying to deal with it on our own, which is why we reached out for help obviously, but i had a little bit of a sense of panic, on my part, of wanting to be able to help my daughter and not understanding why it kicked in for her."
3001,3001_037.txt,0,0.3514772057533264,interview- any other questions or anything you wanted to add on to that point?,"for me, about cbt itself is that, um my husband and myself practice it as well so for us we didn’t have the quite “what’s going on?” the unfamiliarity with it."
3001,3001_037.txt,0,0.37380996346473694,it’s sort of a similar question but,"um, i don’t, initially for cbt i guess we wanted to know what, um what kinda the prognosis is, what like does everyone like, you know, succeed and flourish under doing cbt or is it only certain types of personalities or types of challenges you have."
3001,3001_037.txt,0,0.43871021270751953,right exactly,so that was something we thought about in the beginning.
3001,3001_037.txt,0,0.43677768111228943,um like how had you heard about it in the media or stuff like that.,not very much.
3001,3001_037.txt,0,0.36833688616752625,ok,"it was, i mean for me with it just from an academic side of things, it was close enough to the areas i which i have studied in the past that you know i have bits and pieces of it through academic journals or professional papers and things to that nature, um but um, not anything that as far as um popular media is concerned that i would have gotten, or that is sort of out there that i was familiar with from that area."
3001,3001_038.txt,0,0.42086076736450195,"ok, anything from like friends or like other sources like people, word of mouth type sources",i don’t think so as far as for cbt as far as um that as an option.
3001,3001_038.txt,0,0.7073820233345032,"um thinking about your experience with cbt, were there any parts of therapy that were confusing to you guys?","um, i don’t think anything is confusing for cbt, other than it may not always be a clear picture of like how long you may have to go through a certain element of it because you really unless you start that particular thing with the child you don’t know if this will take a day or two weeks, or so that part will always be kind of cloudy because there is no black and white, everybody is different, everybody’s brain works differently, everybody has more challenges in some ways or others, so i think the time frame is really something that can’t really be nailed down."
3001,3001_038.txt,0,0.3256027400493622,yeah,"with the exception of the time issue, i thought that both the, uh, psychiatrists that we initially saw and then the counselor on the first visit i thought explained quite well what the process is gonna be."
3001,3001_038.txt,0,0.43591028451919556,that’s good,"as far as my stand point, and i’m not sure for my daughters but"
3001,3001_038.txt,0,0.6130030751228333,what do you think you guys would tell someone who is just about to start cbt.,"i think i would tell them that a good worthwhile tool that will really aide them in getting a faster result than normal, our children both have cbt and they both have medication, so um i’ve seen medication and the cbt work together work the best, but if i had to choose one or the other i think the cbt by itself alone will get you results because you’re pushing the brain to challenge and overcome that obstacle and make it be okay and then you picture the next one and make it be okay so you’re kind of in a way, in my head, reprogramming your main brain for the rest of your life."
3001,3001_038.txt,0,0.35197126865386963,ok.,with the exception of you know encouraging someone to be patient and work through the system.
3001,3001_039.txt,0,0.5137366652488708,"um and what would those words be, it’s kind of a hard question but.","let’s see, cbt, first just thinking about it would be, i would say, challenging."
3001,3001_039.txt,0,0.5019837617874146,ok.,"um, i would start with hope."
3001,3001_039.txt,0,0.42409539222717285,right,"so um, discipline to um do the behavior"
3001,3001_039.txt,0,0.3160656988620758,"speaker1 – to me just from being in therapy so much all the time with the children, i think of holding hands or a hand reaching out to grab another hand because it’s like your giving a tool, a way of lie, a way to combat something that can be overwhelming, so somebody’s helping you, helping hand to lift you up and get you to that next step.","i like that, that’s good."
3001,3001_039.txt,0,0.7959294319152832,if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life what would you say?,"i would say anxiety would become a problem in your life if it affects, interferes with your normal, daily, ritual, routine lifestyle."
3001,3001_040.txt,0,0.5938587188720703,"um, is there anything else that might be important for other patients to know how anxiety is becoming a problem in their life?","um, i think sometimes as an individual you might not always understand and see the anxiety’s being overwhelming, sometimes its family members or people closest to you that give you a wakeup call or kind of an intervention that you need to have help with your anxiety."
3001,3001_040.txt,0,0.34972327947616577,um could you guys tell me if there are,"i think cbt targets the brains ability to, if something bad happens, give you a better perspective or give you a way out."
3001,3001_040.txt,0,0.32937872409820557,"sure, um any specific skills or areas that cbt targets?","um, faulty thinking and trying to recognize when you’re not um where your thinking a situation is one thing but it’s not really and then the ramifications of that."
3001,3001_041.txt,0,0.5773383975028992,"ok, um so what was your involvement in cbt for your kids and what would you think would be useful for other parents to know?","um, i’ve been involved with our kinds as far as kind of the “brainstormer” to help figure out what challenges need to be addressed, to be the reminder to “you need to do this part of your therapy”, “this is what you need to do on a daily basis in case you forget”, to be somebody who is there to also help instigate some of the behavior to um to get it solved, sometimes you have to do something with the child in order to get the behavior to move forward you have to put them in a scenario."
3001,3001_041.txt,0,0.46783456206321716,would that be useful?,"yes i have heard and researched and read from books and or article through the internet and what not about cbt because it was, it’s the more knowledge you gain then you know better you use the tool, so to speak."
3001,3001_042.txt,0,0.3553740084171295,we kind of touched on it a little bit already.,"for us, um, personal experience our self for us as parents to our children so it was easier for us to go jump into this cbt because it’s just a way of getting tools and whatnot, for the life to com."
3001,3001_042.txt,0,0.4381646513938904,like broadly speaking.,"well, i think that um you get two target audiences here, the adults and the parents."
3001,3001_043.txt,0,0.5193340182304382,"do you think, in general, parents, friends, doctor, do you think those people should be characters in the video other than the main child or animal or the main character?","i think so, because if you have some authority figures in there as far as a doctor or a psychologist or psychiatrist."
3001,3001_043.txt,0,0.4782656729221344,any ideas or inclinations towards those?,"i kind of see maybe being in an outdoor kind of area, so it seems like it’s a very, um, it’s not a stifling kind of conversation and whoever they’re talking to or talking about, it’s like they’re outdoor or an activity that’s very; they’re on the edge of what’s happening in the real world."
3001,3001_044.txt,0,0.5907399654388428,ok.,we give you a 50/50 choice.
3001,3001_044.txt,0,0.5684093236923218,"so this is the first one, this is the second one…","uh, what would this represent?"
3001,3001_045.txt,0,0.610612154006958,so this is the last one… so again i just want to hear if there is any style here that you guys like or don’t like.,can i see the first one again?
3001,3001_045.txt,0,0.4671102464199066,any suggestions about it in general.,"i like the comic book, the third one, the comic book blended."
3001,3001_045.txt,0,0.3402206301689148,the comic art blended.,"with, if you’re going with a certain target based off age, because marvel the characters and stuff that’s out and about, you will hit kids who won’t care, won’t think about, won’t be interested, “that’s not going to help me” that kind of thing, that you may not get because that is a wide category kind of the preteen age that’ll be like you know “it’s not cool to have therapy” kind of thing, but this might be like “hey that’s kind of cool”."
3001,3001_045.txt,0,0.48076921701431274,like preteen age.,i think that would be good for that/
3001,3001_045.txt,0,0.5120608806610107,and again anything that you like or don’t like in general.,the uh i like this expect for i can see it carry toward boy rather than the boys and i would be concerned.
3001,3001_045.txt,0,0.45292991399765015,the vector art,"yeah um, these almost look to like childish"
3001,3001_045.txt,0,0.8035960793495178,"so like live action with characters, as well.","live action with characters would be, i think, a little bit more suitable on it."
3001,3001_045.txt,0,0.4057818353176117,the line art,"unless, i personally think it’s distracting."
3001,3001_046.txt,0,0.5187298655509949,and that lends well in to what i am; this next question is what do you think the take home message from the video should be?,i would say that the take home message would be like in a way they always go like “ask your doctor about so and so” but it would be like a way they show cbt can be to help and that it’s a tool.
3001,3001_046.txt,0,0.5252305269241333,and finally is there anything that i missed or anything important that i didn’t ask about that you think is relevant to making cbt videos?,i don’t have any additional comment.
3001,3001_047.txt,0,0.35477983951568604,the whole aspect of it so i don’t think anything is set in stone yet.,just i would always take into consideration you don’t want to make it more than 22 minutes and you want it more than 7 because you can usually get messages across to people better in that little time frame of 7 to 22 minutes for kids and for adults for that matter.
3001,3001_047.txt,0,0.42143508791923523,"note taker- i guess toward the beginning with the question saying like “what did you want to know about cbt when you first started?” you said you didn’t have any you could think of, so maybe now that we’ve talked about it","maybe the only thing would be about it would be just the time table, but with the realization of it, for some people it’s a long process."
3001,3001_047.txt,0,0.531927227973938,so to start can you tell me what comes to mind when you think of cbt.,"a therapist or psychologist talking with the adolescent about, or even an adult, about ways to handle different stressors um so… um it’s something that helps to reframe how a child sees or experiences what they think is a problem."
3001,3001_047.txt,0,0.7045522928237915,what would you explain what it is?,can you restate the question.
3001,3001_047.txt,0,0.6617918014526367,you know kind of summarize that.,narrow it down.
3001,3001_047.txt,0,0.6160760521888733,"and when you first learned about this type of therapy that we do here, do you remember if you had any questions or if there was something specific you wanted to know about cbt?","well, i also have gone through considerable cbt therapy so when it came time for my daughter to um go through it as well i didn’t hesitate to put her in it because i knew it was something that worked."
3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.5180610418319702,you kind of knew what to expect.,right.
3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.4284510910511017,"yeah, and how much did you know about cbt from movies, the media, tv, other people, and if so did this match yours or your child’s experience?",so would this involve mindfulness as well or...?

3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.36476361751556396,"yeah um so how much did you learn or hear about cbt from movies, tv, internet, media, any of those outside sources?","um there… i’m a interviewer so there are a couple of interviewer songs that indicate breathing techniques you know slow down, appreciate where you are, and take a breath, or take a deep breath and hold on."
3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.44993898272514343,do those thing being described match yours and your daughter’s experiences with cbt?,part of it yeah.
3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.5483725666999817,and thinking about yours and your child’s experience was there anything about cbt that was confusing?,about the… i didn’t know how… didn’t know the method um and they didn’t tell me.
3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.4734230041503906,"07: 27mmh yeah so really like the method, the process was what was confusing.","i do have to say that learning the breathing techniques at first, or actually for a while and for some people, i know it was very strange so i’ve been through dbt as well and um some people i remember just seemed to think that it was just more buddhist type of an activity and i know i also sort of thought that as well because some of the… if you say the word meditation if you are talking to kids from strong interviewer background, people who do still go to church although it seems like we are dwindling group um, it’s a little put offish in way."
3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.38523563742637634,so being patient and knowing that it truly is a goal-oriented type practice.,yeah
3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.5180081129074097,"ok awesome and if you could think of three words to describe cbt when you first learned about it, what would those be?",i’m thinking.
3001,3001_048.txt,0,0.5909402370452881,take your time,"calmness, reframing… all i can think about are sentences um… i can’t think of another word."
3001,3001_049.txt,0,0.41212743520736694,"so for each of those words if you had to add a picture to them calmness, reframing, mindfulness, or being in the moment what would they look like?",i would think that would differ for each person.
3001,3001_049.txt,0,0.42127662897109985,what would that look like?,so reframing would be like i have a memory of an event that happened and i think of it almost has my… it’s complicated but i. um so reframing would be me having my opinion about based on limited information at the time when i was a child and having the therapist or the psychologist ask me what would have happened if my mom had taken me somewhere else..
3001,3001_049.txt,0,0.43862491846084595,so kind of like presenting a hypothetical.,yeah yeah and it makes you go back.
3001,3001_049.txt,0,0.453005313873291,"yeah, so would you say maybe a picture that could be associated with the reframing would be someone sitting with a therapist or someone  ___ showing support or","yes, showing support um helping them to realize that there is more than one choice."
3001,3001_049.txt,0,0.5257724523544312,"so the goal of cbt many times is to reduce anxiety, so if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in one’s life what would you say it looks like?",um having lived with it all of my life it is a little hard to say but anxiety would be someone talking to fast or doing too many things and not necessarily doing them well or not finishing them.
3001,3001_049.txt,0,0.529227614402771,yeah and um what’s important for other patients to know?,about

3001,3001_050.txt,0,0.4876629412174225,how anxiety can become a problem in someone’s life or um what’s important to know just for someone who is experiencing those things?,its ok for you to get help.

3001,3001_050.txt,0,0.3697003126144409,so would you say before starting it was really you… your question is what is this because you were going into not really knowing what to expect.,i interviewed several therapists and counselors beforehand and at the time i was faculty at uf.
3001,3001_050.txt,0,0.6411770582199097,and what is your involvement in your child’s overall cbt therapy?,so her counselor or her psychologist lately like for the last several visits has invited me into the sessions maybe for 10-15 minutes to let her know what i think should be covered because sometimes my daughter forgets mention certain things or just flat out doesn’t want to talk about it.
3001,3001_051.txt,0,0.4750220775604248,awesome and what would be useful for other parents to know that maybe have a child that is about to go into cbt or is in cbt?,be patient.
3001,3001_051.txt,0,0.4221375584602356,to be patient and stuff like that.,and if they have concerns that the therapist needs to know about to make sure that they are not afraid to talk to the therapist or you know to just you know touch them on the shoulder or something and say can i talk to for just a minute.
3001,3001_051.txt,0,0.784562349319458,"and have you read or heard any scientific research that has mentions cbt, and if so or if not do you think this something useful for us to mention in our videos?",research on cbt.

3001,3001_051.txt,0,0.5252737402915955,"so as of right now we are trying to make the video appeal to both the patients and their family so pretty much all age groups, but um yeah.",and is it just one video?
3001,3001_051.txt,0,0.5585198402404785,as of right now.,um and at what point where would you being showing it?
3001,3001_052.txt,0,0.4088827967643738,so ideally we would like… i mean it would be something that would be shown to patients and families right before they would start treatment to kind of better understand what they are going to be doing.,so not like a public service announcement type of thing.
3001,3001_052.txt,0,0.7746652960777283,um no more so targeting people who are going into cbt.,ok so an introduction to cbt.
3001,3001_052.txt,0,0.5109451413154602,"probably something pretty concise, but enough information so people know what to expect.",so remind me your question.

3001,3001_052.txt,0,0.4803048074245453,"sometimes, it depends.",i don’t know if i would include anything outside of nuclear family or grandparents.
3001,3001_052.txt,0,0.42961588501930237,um so what about where they would talk… what would be a good setting for the video or multiple settings?,um i’m a realist so you know to set the standard.
3001,3001_052.txt,0,0.39240261912345886,yeah,i probably would not do one where there’s a two-way mirror involved because that is that would make anybody feel uncomfortable so.
3001,3001_052.txt,0,0.3575829267501831,so really just like the therapist office would be the best setting.,yeah because you don’t want to sugarcoat it.
3001,3001_053.txt,0,0.6468154788017273,yeah,so i don’t know.
3001,3001_053.txt,0,0.41811972856521606,what should be talked about in the videos and should there be specific questions asked and addressed in the videos?,i would ask the counselors or the psychologists that one.

3001,3001_053.txt,0,0.3986007273197174,it’s more so the perspective of the child as the patient but the parents are still involved.,"ok… so um you know if they have a lovey animal, you know a little lovey animal or a stuff animal that they bring with them you know, if it’s not too corny you can ask how the lovey is doing or the stuff animal so."

3001,3001_053.txt,0,0.46829313039779663,like should that a be like a question between maybe characters or should it be in the form of kind of a little snippet of an interview of kids explaining how its worked for them.,i’m not completely sure they know what method is being used on them and i’m not quite sure it’s necessary that they know.
3001,3001_053.txt,0,0.4514695107936859,"do you think that there should be kids saying those things like its helped them, the feel better, and things of that sort?",yeah

3001,3001_062.txt,0,0.6630476713180542,"okay, is there anything else?","no, i think that’s it."
3001,3001_062.txt,0,0.6254637837409973,thank you so much for your time.,of course.
3001,3001_062.txt,0,0.4201365113258362,so that’s some questions you might have different thoughts on based off of either.,do you include the fear facers camp?
3001,3001_062.txt,0,0.3881016671657562,"yes, you can include stuff from fear facers.",because that was very awesome.
3001,3001_062.txt,0,0.6931846141815186,that would be fine for this as well.,okay.
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.5103457570075989,"alright so just to start, can you tell me what comes to mind when you think about cbt or cognitive behavioral therapy- the therapy that we talked about?","what comes to mind would be real-time applicable practicing different scenarios that base some sort of psychological- internal thing that’s going on with a person but try to simulate and actively address but it feels like, what it looks like and then continuing to sort of arming someone with tools so that they’re able to get used to that sort of feeling and how to handle themselves when they’re potentially experiencing that for real."
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.31443190574645996,so really simulating a real life experience and giving them tools for helping with that.,yeah.
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.4297937750816345,if it’s any different from what you said.,"sort of- i feel like it’s like thinking about, sort of that metacognition where you’re thinking about your thinking."
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.273002028465271,yeah.,normally you aren’t asked to do that unless it’s sort of causing some sort of distress to one’s self to think about what you’re thinking with certain things.
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.4322842061519623,you were talking about metacognition and thinking about thinking when normally you wouldn’t do that.,what was your question now?
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.4145282506942749,"oh, my question was just how would you explain cbt to someone else?",okay.
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.575717568397522,right so realizing this is the result…,a thought process that happened and kind of thinking about okay recognizing where does this start?
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.379614919424057,"so there’s, you know, those thoughts having something to help you with preventing it from spiraling.",yes.
3001,3001_063.txt,0,0.637911856174469,was summer camp before you came here or did you come here first?,here first.
3001,3001_064.txt,0,0.3773770034313202,so it sounds like you had a good idea of what it entails but.,well it was sort of strange because we were on the waiting list for a really long time so we ended up starting therapy with- i don’t remember it was so long ago- how it wasn’t normally done that way type situation but i don’t remember when it was supposed to be done it was like forever out long we couldn’t do it so we started seeing someone first so at first it was sort of getting a diagnosis of even what was going on and finding out that there were a combination potentially of things going.
3001,3001_064.txt,0,0.4637579619884491,that’s okay.,i did not eat lunch today.
3001,3001_064.txt,0,0.44178932905197144,but you talked about the diagnosis and it being a combination of things.,yes.
3001,3001_065.txt,0,0.6283634305000305,so you talked about that being the first thing and so i’m guessing after that came the recommendation for therapy?,yes and then we were told because there were- i was like is this going to be talk therapy where we come in and talk about our feelings type thing?
3001,3001_066.txt,0,0.31806066632270813,"yeah no. you talked about, you know, before doing therapy you said they kind of talked about the different paths you could take, they talked about the fear hierarchy, and then i think you mentioned with the rainbow.","yeah, i forgot what it was."
3001,3001_066.txt,0,0.3523792624473572,so it sounds like you’re saying that knowing the- having the visual representation was helpful to kind of know what to expect and also being able to know the different paths you can take were helpful.,right.
3001,3001_066.txt,0,0.3397328853607178,and if you don’t that’s okay.,"well one i just wished i would have realized was i remember when we were talking about which kind of path to take i really had no idea and not that-maybe there is not guarantee but like how quickly it could be if it was intensive because looking back, i mean, it took us many months to get through something that was affecting her on a daily basis."
3001,3001_067.txt,0,0.5923115015029907,how quick necessarily.,yeah.
3001,3001_067.txt,0,0.3185504674911499,so… maybe that might be helpful if people knew that or patients knew that coming in?,yeah.
3001,3001_067.txt,0,0.7140694260597229,that people also have these similar issues.,and people they can probably relate to on many levels.
3001,3001_067.txt,0,0.5771231651306152,or actually at any point?,no.
3001,3001_067.txt,0,0.7130146026611328,okay.,to the point.
3001,3001_067.txt,0,0.5150273442268372,so it’s collaborative.,yeah. ultimately i feel like she’s in control of it.
3001,3001_068.txt,0,0.737238883972168,she still has some control.,yeah she’s felt like she’s had some control of it i think so that’s helped her feel like she can still make progress without having to completely submit to everyone.
3001,3001_068.txt,0,0.415481299161911,you talked about- you mentioned how you didn’t realize that ocd can be this thought labor-,yeah this really internal.
3001,3001_068.txt,0,0.47727590799331665,does that make sense?,"i think so, well from what i have seen it almost they like remedies almost even."
3001,3001_068.txt,0,0.5464280247688293,"so you mentioned, oh sorry were you?",no.
3001,3001_069.txt,0,0.42123904824256897,are there any other skills or specific areas that cbt seems to target that seems to help build… or any thoughts or feelings or actions?,"well i think it is sort of a practice, realizing that it’s something that you have to work out."
3001,3001_069.txt,0,0.3556055724620819,so it sounds like she had some specific skills and it sounds like also kind of getting rid of some avoidance.,"alright, good… yeah."
3001,3001_069.txt,0,0.44203606247901917,it sounds like that used to be kind of the coping strategy but not-,yeah.
3001,3001_069.txt,0,0.46646255254745483,as much as in clinic but also outside in the real world.,"right, yeah."
3001,3001_070.txt,0,0.3655007481575012,as far as the therapy?,"so, i’ve always tried to give the option of letting my child just own it and go without me which is not how i normally parent."

3001,3001_070.txt,0,0.3469415307044983,and you mentioned kind of your experience and you mentioned like some of the things that you kind of have to know before you get into it are the logistics and the expense.,yeah.
3001,3001_070.txt,0,0.5593512058258057,is there anything else that would be useful for other parents to know before they kind of have their child jump into this?,"i don’t know anything else, yeah."
3001,3001_070.txt,0,0.4763660132884979,so how much did you know about cbt from these other things?,nothing.
3001,3001_070.txt,0,0.49942782521247864,okay… did you ever- or have you ever read or heard any scientific research about cbt?,no.
3001,3001_070.txt,0,0.3647834360599518,or do you think it wouldn’t really be-have an effect.,"i mean i feel like everybody loves a bullet point, you know like a statistic any sort of research based quick- if it’s quick."
3001,3001_070.txt,0,0.7051456570625305,"so quick research base like bullet points, statistics","statistics, yeah like a statistic."
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.40848982334136963,so it may not necessarily…,numbers like i always feel like that gives validity to something when you can put a value on it and numbers tend to do that.
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.6019912958145142,is that some kind of percentage of something or is that some other?,"yeah, maybe."
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.31678271293640137,pie charts?,"you know, a quick understandable- because i would think if you’re looking at options, you know, there would be other types of therapies that you could do as well."
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.5741690397262573,some kind of comparison?,yeah.
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.37585875391960144,that’s perfectly- perfectly fine.,they’ll have to shop everything now and sort of compare.
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.4697134792804718,everyone’s kind of like a consumer of multiple things.,right.
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.5422359704971313,alright.,an infographic.

3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.3035811185836792,okay.,"but because of my position i end up talking- because i’m involved with so many children and so many families and often working with different families and children- not my child but, you know, somebody else and learning okay so we were here before and now because- you know- i’ve had parents mention before that they are doing cbt with their children on different"
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.6075952053070068,so it sounds like it was mostly positive?,yes!
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.5962562561035156,no but- right.,i don’t hear a lot about it.
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.8323636651039124,i mean and if it did-,if it did-
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.6445185542106628,"it would be good to know, right?",right.
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.5407306551933289,so it sounds like pretty much all positive even the little bit that you’ve heard.,yeah.
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.4324333667755127,for describing cbt.,"i think the only thing i can think of is, you know, sort of tongue and cheek."
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.5007116198539734,that’s your personal answer.,it just seems obvious like it’s almost so easy- it seems so obvious.
3001,3001_071.txt,0,0.4802526831626892,"okay, so obvious.","yeah. it’s just- but it’s almost making things too hard or too whatever, you know."

3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.5332207679748535,"so i heard obvious, simple, and what was the third one?",yeah.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.5528664588928223,quick?,we could do that.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.5189448595046997,they don’t have to be- this is kind of just how you felt.,i know.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.3737057149410248,and it can be one for each one or it could be one for as a group.,yeah… i’m like flat lined now.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.5696969628334045,that’s okay.,can you rephrase you question?
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.46900004148483276,what kind of picture?,"i don’t have any, which is so funny."
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.6457952857017517,okay.,there is no picture.

3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.524399995803833,"okay, what about- does anything come to mind for simple?",no.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.6690229177474976,what about quick?,a stopwatch?
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.48246291279792786,just wondering if there is any image that you can think of that associates with that.,yeah like all comedy things.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.3473290801048279,just something funny?,"yeah, i can almost see taking out your, and not in a gory way, taking your brain out of your head and rocking it, giving it a hug, you know, just taking care of yourself kind of in a way."
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.5957258939743042,cheesy is fine.,that’s what you get right now.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.4798119068145752,"so, i’ll kind of go through a few questions regarding that and then i have some templates for you to look at.",okay.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.43163320422172546,what kind of characters do you think we should include?,"i almost feel like if its kid based, i would almost feel like it would be not… you’re doing a cartoon."
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.44018489122390747,there- we’re not entirely sure but we are- i think the idea is animated.,"i think for adults would be more drawn to, you know, actual people."
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.6302760243415833,for lack of a better word.,yeah.
3001,3001_072.txt,0,0.5960662364959717,so not animated?,maybe.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.5292047262191772,maybe?,"i’m kind of a big kid so it doesn’t really, i don’t count."
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.5599014759063721,what would your preference be would it be to be animated or live action?,i just want it to be funny.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.431207537651062,okay.,lighthearted because it’s really stressful.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.32441598176956177,:right.,"it’s really stressful to be worried about someone else and even yourself and realize like you know there’s work to be done i’ve got to make some decisions so i’d rather it be informative, fast, and sort of upbeat and lighthearted because everything’s stressed anyway so um yeah."
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.49502140283584595,"i think that those are some really good key words like informative, fast…",don’t want it to be too self-reflective…
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.5232397317886353,but adding some lightheartedness.,yeah.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.34285426139831543,"um so as far as what’s in the videos, again these characters, should we have any nonhuman characters?",definitely.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.6860300302505493,okay so animals?,sure.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.5359905958175659,"okay, what are some nonhuman characters maybe?",i don’t know i’m just really stuck on robots right now.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.37558332085609436,okay.,"i’m in a robot phase so i do a lot of robot stuff with my students and we talk about our brains all the time, we kiss our brains all the time, and we have a brain train."
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.5080080628395081,"okay so funny, looney toons, possibly animals, possibly some robots.","yeah, yeah."
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.6153324246406555,okay.,i don’t know why.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.6195498108863831,okay so should there be any superheroes?,"um, they would be their own superheroes."
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.5060241222381592,okay.,everyone wants to be their own superhero.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.32576170563697815,i think a lot of people definitely have the desire to be a superhero.,"well it’s harder for kids too because you gotta worry about, do they identify with that kid or are they the right ethnicity, is it a boy is it a girl, is it a whatever."
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.44022002816200256,"that’s a good point and that leads me to my next question; should we include children in the video and if so should it be a boy, girl or both?",yeah.
3001,3001_073.txt,0,0.4888055920600891,could be chris pratt.,is it a boy is it a girl.
3001,3001_074.txt,0,0.43863165378570557,this kind of gives you some basic information or as you’re about to start therapy this would be helpful for…,i tend to be a little bit more of a researcher so if it were something i could see or play ahead of time.
3001,3001_074.txt,0,0.6356193423271179,when you say “quick” can you give me a timeframe like if it under this amount of time.,under three minutes.
3001,3001_074.txt,0,0.4703187644481659,that was helpful because different people have different definitions of “quick” so that’s probably what mine would be as well.,and that’s a pretty long time these days because everybody swipes and clicks and is used to controlling everything like really like ten seconds.
3001,3001_074.txt,0,0.7479194402694702,none of the above?,i don’t know.
3001,3001_074.txt,0,0.4774404764175415,"so it sounds like the content, to you, is more important than the location.","yeah as an adult, the bullet points i would be looking for the bullet points."
3001,3001_074.txt,0,0.5374253392219543,i never really thought about that.,it’s not crazy it totally makes sense.
3001,3001_075.txt,0,0.4930892884731293,what questions about cbt do our characters need to ask and answer?,"it could kind of be playful… it could be what the roles are, like what do i have to do?"
3001,3001_075.txt,0,0.6122813820838928,would that be useful?,i think so.
3001,3001_075.txt,0,0.4409579932689667,"uhm… so asking those types, finding out if that would be helpful?","well if, i wouldn’t talk about anxiety if that specifically-if cbt is used for broader things."
3001,3001_075.txt,0,0.5750067830085754,got you.,i wouldn’t want to…
3001,3001_075.txt,0,0.8163667321205139,okay.,yeah.
3001,3001_075.txt,0,0.409159779548645,should they ask about how it has worked for their kids?,yeah.
3001,3001_075.txt,0,0.5585823059082031,should they ask about how exposures work?,i would think yes?
3001,3001_075.txt,0,0.3813056945800781,"okay, right… no you’re okay.","but it could be a game show where there’s a quiz, you know."

3001,3001_076.txt,0,0.6446387767791748,we’re glad that it’s your experience.,yeah.
3001,3001_076.txt,0,0.6339511275291443,"okay, so presenting kind of like how that could… how it seems-","yeah. what an exposure- what that might even, in a quick basic way showing kind of what the roles would be or what that might look like. a little-"

3001,3001_076.txt,0,0.6041727662086487,right. and so especially i’m guessing- well so would that be useful even if it was just one video or would that be better in a separate parent video?,"in my mind i almost feel like you can do both in one but it would probably need to be longer than three minutes. i don’t know how your content would go but i feel like a kids one would be a little different than what a parent’s one would be. it would be more a little factual based whereas a kid one would be more experienced based. the role playing, like what it’s going to look like. again you said you didn’t know if this was just going to be pediatrics right? the patients could also be adults."
3001,3001_076.txt,0,0.4800201654434204,1:no. sorry i may have misspoke. all the patients will be pediatric. the only thing we haven’t decided on what whether or not it would be one video or two separate ones.,1:i would think to separate ones.
3001,3001_076.txt,0,0.6696430444717407,:so do you think having two separate videos would be beneficial but in addition would you prefer to have one five minute video or two separate three minute.,1:i would make it longer. i mean it doesn’t even have to be 3 minutes just depending on how much content you have. you can probably keep kids for three minutes but you probably can’t keep adults that long. you would keep me that long.
3001,3001_076.txt,0,0.5829640030860901,1:good to know.,1:unless i got really sidetracked.
3001,3001_077.txt,0,0.5089969635009766,"1:so we’re almost done and i really appreciate your time. we just have to go over the “how” the video would look. just kind of the fun part of this. and then just kind of the take home message, then we should be done. so we talked about loony tunes before, are there any other animated movies that you like?","1:i mean everybody loves like; the minion stuff is like hilarious. and i also think like part of the reason why is because they’re not people. like what are they, who even knows? so fun. it’s pretty entertaining, anything that have comedy is good. i use a lot of “brainpop”. i don’t know if you know that, it’s the robot and the girl in the classroom and they just love anytime they hear the robot noises they want like the MAKES_NOISE like he’s very squeaky and they want all the extra stuff."
3001,3001_077.txt,0,0.5889438986778259,"1:so they like, like the little squeakiness of the robot.","1:yeah. even my math curriculum has like animated stuff. and little monsters, they like the monsters too but they like the robots."

3001,3001_077.txt,0,0.5617217421531677,1:option 3,1:this looks a little more mature like teens. this feels very vanilla to me.
3001,3001_077.txt,0,0.5395686626434326,1:options two seems kind of vanilla?,1:like its friendly but this one is the one i like the best. it seems more creative and youthful but also that’s what i’m drawn to.  i also really like it because you blend humans and i like anything that looks hand rendered and i think kids identify with that too.
3001,3001_077.txt,0,0.5163809061050415,1:so you like option 1 the best and you like the mixture of the animated and the hand drawn. you like that options personally the best but would that be the best for kids?,1:i don’t know. these are softer and playful
3001,3001_077.txt,0,0.3437289893627167,1:option 2 is a little bit softer. ok. what do you think should be the take home message of these videos? we’ve kind of hit on this so… unless i’m mistaken.,1:i feel like there’s so many buzzwords but you know it really is just like doable because you get results. you can see results. nearly immediately without much doing on my part other than bringing my child here and getting him the space to be; whatever happens in there. and then just kind of being aware and i did get some tips like you can’t be so nice. don’t be so reassuring or affirming. just not like trying to fix everything. but like it really is doable; it’s not a hard thing to do or take a lot of resources to do other than time and money. so i think it’s pretty quick. user friendly. again i didn’t have to as a parent lead things or keep up with a whole lot like it’s something that really empowered my child to own it and take it into her own hands for the most part.
3001,3001_077.txt,0,0.5498663783073425,1:that makes a lot of sense. you as a parent or you as a child that would be nice to get from the video.,"1:yeah. kids like to be empowered. i feel like there’s almost two schools nowadays. the kids that have no power and the kids that have way too much power. there’s not many of the in between kids. i feel like anybody who feels like they’re in a place where they’re needing therapy like this is your thing to do for yourself kind of type thing and makes it user friendly. again the parent it’s not a thing where you have to poke and nag because usually whatever is on their list is usually on yours including everything else. it really wasn’t a burden other than me getting her here and paying for everything. again i think it’s just everybody really likes it, it’s convenient, you get fast results, it’s very empowering for your child or it was for us. it just seems effective and also another thing is that there’s no side effects. i almost feel like there could be a parody video or comedy that would just probably be for me but like about how you know there’s all these happy people and they’re like “yes, yes and you might die and your skin may fall off and everything’s burning but there’s still 27% of people that do…” like everything is said with a smile on the face. sounds so great but really what they’re telling you is terrible. like this is not terrible. the risk that is involved in doing this method it’s like pretty low risk for pretty quick results."
3001,3001_078.txt,0,0.38648852705955505,1:well is there anything that i missed or anything important that i didn’t ask about?,"1:i don’t think so. i just wish that this was more available like just to the public in general. mental health has become such a big thing, especially with adolescence. like i have to go to trainings all the time about all these things and i’m in the front lines with people’s kids that are going through all kinds of crazy stuff all the time and its intense and i feel like we get a lot of feedback about our school like “what are the resources?” and some don’t even know. it’s like there’s too many options or not knowing who to ask the right questions. so of course i’m always like “your pediatrician”. it’s almost like an alternative therapy but once you say “alternative therapy” some people immediately think it’s like a chant in the woods or something type thing or you’re going to sign up for this big weird thing so it would be great to have. i think it’s great what you guys are setting out to do and succeeded. people would watch a quick video that gave just enough information to be like “oh, maybe this is something we could do.”"

3001,3001_078.txt,0,0.4366922974586487,"and you can refer to it as cbt if you’d like. so to start, could you tell me what comes to mind when you think about cbt?",basically just helping with whatever issues- i mean i think of… specifically what NAME- you know just helping with the issues that she has.
3001,3001_078.txt,0,0.4087134301662445,"okay. when you say issues, generally what are you speaking of? could you elaborate a little bit?",NAME has anxiety.

3001,3001_078.txt,0,0.4678553342819214,okay. so could you tell me what you know about cbt in your own words? how would you explain what cbt is?,that is not an easy one for me.
3001,3001_078.txt,0,0.3172253370285034,the best you can do.,"…talking, a lot of talking and… discussing what is happening throughout life and how to work through whatever… whatever issues have come up throughout life basically."
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.39556509256362915,"okay. perfect. so when you first learned about the therapy we do here, cbt, do you remember any questions that you had about the process or just cbt in general?","no. things had become so chaotic in our life at home. you know, we went to our pediatrician and… just said please help and she said go here and we said okay."
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.49553847312927246,okay. did you know anything about cbt going in?,no.
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.42960324883461,"no? okay. so how much did you know about cbt from movies, tv, the internet, or other people in general?",nothing.
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.5323256254196167,"nothing? okay so you didn’t know anything. so thinking about your experience with cbt were there any parts of the therapy that were confusing or- yeah, that were confusing?","no. you know, we didn’t really have a lot of discussion about, you know, what was going to happen or- it was just everything had become so incredibly chaotic… it was, something has to happen and something has to change. help us and the pediatrician said do this and we were doing this."
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.47446808218955994,"okay. so if someone were to ask you about cbt, what would you want to tell them if they were about to start the therapy?","for us, it’s been- for us specifically with NAME because we have- we’ve done it with NAME and, you know, we’ve got the younger ones in therapy now also for different reasons but… for NAME it’s been extremely helpful. she obviously still has anxiety, i don’t think that’s something that’s ever going to change. it’s just part of her personality and who she is. but we can talk her through… panic attacks and calm her down just through talking and… but having another outlet in a different person for her to talk to… is absolutely a wonderful thing for her to have."
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.4667202830314636,"okay. great. so when you think about how you felt about cbt when you first learned about it, can you think of three words to describe how you felt? i know it would be kind of a weird question but…","i didn’t really know anything about it, at that point. so…"
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.44527408480644226,"so when you first learned about it. after it was explained to you, did you have any thoughts in your mind about cbt? that could be in 3 words.",i don’t really know how to answer that because that was so – that was so long ago. i’m sorry.
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.3579815924167633,"okay. that’s okay. maybe we’ll circle back around to that question. so the goal of cbt is to reduce anxiety so if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life, what would you say?","i feel like… for… for us, i think a lot of NAME had to do with external factors… i think it’s always, you know, there as a part of her personality but i think external factors exacerbate it. i think we’ve had a lot of family drama, which for her triggers that."
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.4193527400493622,so you would say family drama is one of your external factors?,correct.
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.3740657567977905,okay. are there any other external factors that exacerbate her anxiety?,"school drama, which sadly being a teenage girl, is a factor of life."
3001,3001_079.txt,0,0.36465224623680115,"yup. okay. these are good examples. so what is important for other patients to know about how anxiety becomes an issue? so like you said external factors like school, family. what would be important for patients to know when starting cbt?","it has to be a very honest process. that’s one of the- that’s one of the concerns i had with NAME, you know, because she’s very reserved and closed off, is that she wouldn’t be-she wouldn’t give it a chance and really open up to anybody. so, it has to be a very honest process."
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.4947138726711273,so could you tell me if there is any specific skills or areas that cbt targets? it could be in your experience with your daughter.,"you know, i don’t know because we don’t- you know, NAME and i- we don’t talk about her sessions. so she keeps that as her time for whatever she wants to discuss. i know she has been much more open and communicative with me since she’s started therapy which... is a wonderful thing."
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.375052809715271,"okay. good. so, as a parent, what is your involvement with cbt with your daughter-daughters?","well, i bring them obviously."
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.29521018266677856,yes.,"but, you know, if we have any… big events that could trigger anxiety or that i think their therapist needs to know about, i will let their therapist know about those issues. but other than- other than that, that’s their time to discuss what they need to discuss."
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.48294928669929504,"for other parents, what would be useful for them to know when bringing their child in for cbt?","i think that… what i really liked was having that first initial meeting with the therapist to discuss overall, big picture what was going on. to kind of go over what the issues and kind of what the goals were. and check in periodically, especially when the life events happen."
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.4896359145641327,so have you ever heard or read about any scientific articles about cbt or any scientific research?,no.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.511276125907898,no. do you think it’s something we should talk about in the videos about cbt? do you think that would be beneficial to include scientific research?,yeah i think that would be helpful. that would be good information to put out there.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.697750985622406,did you know about somebody else’s experiences with cbt? did you know anyone else who was in the therapy as well?,i have personally had therapy so…
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.6089616417884827,oh okay.,i know that it’s helpful.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.722080647945404,so you would say that it’s positive?,yes.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.3841567635536194,"okay. so as we said, we are trying to develop short videos about cbt so this part of the process is about talking about the video itself. so the setting, the characters, what they would be doing. so first we have to decide who would be in the video. so what characters do you think we should include?",i guess that depends on your age range.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.5649913549423218,okay.,that you’re targeting.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.709995448589325,"so the videos would be for parents and children so we’re not sure if we’re going to be doing a separate video for parents or a separate video for children. so if it were one video for both children and parents, what do you think the characters should be?",probably a parent and child if you’re looking for a parent and child video.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.563687264919281,should there be any non-human characters like animals?,"probably, if you’re looking to target children."
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.5002585649490356,or superheroes? kids like superheroes these days.,yeah. depending on your age- depending on the age you’re trying to target.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.6770620942115784,so for the children should we include a boy or a girl or?,"to target the boy group, you’re probably going to want a boy."
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.5948434472084045,yeah. or both that could be an option as well.,that’s true.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.5235607028007507,"so you said parents, should we include a doctor or friends?","…for the target group of- i mean is the goal of the video to… you know, just help parents understand why it’s helpful?"
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.44119396805763245,so the goal of the video itself is to inform people about cbt.,okay.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.519324541091919,whether that’s the parents or the child.,okay… then probably a doctor. that would be helpful.
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.5479797720909119,so now we know who would be in the video. we need to decide where they would be talking. so do you have any ideas of where they could be?,"if you’re going to have a doctor, probably in a doctor’s office. you know, or if it’s a therapist then a therapists office."
3001,3001_080.txt,0,0.5292651653289795,so should we have anything about at home or at school? or even somewhere unrelated.,"…a parent, you know, like a parent-child relationship could be… at home or even in a vehicle. i know a lot of parents, you know, that’s where they spend a lot of time with their kids."
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.7304993271827698,in the car. going to school.,in the cars. right.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.3217819929122925,"okay. so now that we have the setting and the characters, we have to decide what they would be talking about. so we’ve already started talking about cbt itself. so what questions about cbt do our characters need to ask and get answered?",that i don’t know. because i didn’t know anything about it. it was just a last-ditch effort because… NAME was a disaster. i… i mean NAME was falling apart.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.38574761152267456,so should they find out about cbt- about the cbt explanation of how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life? so should they talk about anxiety itself and how it becomes an issue?,"i think that’s a great idea. i mean, i wish- i wish somebody… had, you know, said something to us before NAME had reached the point that she did, you know."
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.5308639407157898,"so now we get to decide how the video will look so we have a couple of examples. here, and i’ll let you look through them. there’s 3 choices, so you can look through these and tell me what you like about them, what you don’t like about them, and what you think would be the best choice for our video-videos.",i don’t like the… option 2.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.417684942483902,so the vector art?,yeah… i don’t know that option 1 with interview style is going to do well with… kids though. getting kids to pay attention.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.4226981997489929,and the third option?,that’s kind of comic book style which would… i think kids will like.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.5413198471069336,so you would say that the 3rd option is your favorite? or…,yeah.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.5432338714599609,"how-why do you like the comic book idea. so you said you like this one the best, what makes this one the best one?","i think kids are… into- not so much teenagers these days but… the younger kids are into reading comic books. books, not the actual comic book style but comic book style books. these days. so, you know, it’ll catch their attention as far as the graphics go. my 7-year-old, that’s her favorite is the comic book style books."
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.2738194167613983,"so option 3 it is. so, now that we’ve figured out how it would look and where it would be, who’s in it. what do you think the take home message of the videos should be?","…that it’s definitely okay to get… help and support. you know, i still think there’s some sort of stigma attached with therapy and counseling for a lot of people which is ridiculous. not only that and you know… i don’t know maybe some of the benefits?"
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.5643101930618286,okay.,i don’t know how to work all that in but.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.5607247352600098,"of course. so circling back around to that 3 word question. now that we’ve talked a bit about cbt, do you think you could- do you think you could think of 3 words that you would use to describe cbt and how you feel about it?","how i- excuse me, how i feel about it now or how i felt about it then?"
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.5368821024894714,"i think either or, you know, you’ve experienced it with your daughter so how does it make you feel?",how does it make me feel? hopeful.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.5379620790481567,okay.,three words… three words should not be hard to find…
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.5090389251708984,"so hopeful is a good one. so if you can’t think of 2 other ones, it’s okay. but if you could add a picture to your word, hopeful, for cbt. what would it be?",just one picture.
3001,3001_081.txt,0,0.46561288833618164,whatever you can give me.,me and NAME sitting on the couch like this.
3001,3001_082.txt,0,0.4136980473995209,"okay. so if you can’t think of 2 other words, that’s alright. but hopeful is a good one. so that’s all the questions i have. do you think there is anything that i missed or anything important that you wanted to talk about cbt?",it’s been extremely helpful for NAME.
3001,3001_082.txt,0,0.5268269181251526,fantastic,it really has.
3001,3001_082.txt,0,0.6333016157150269,"alright, thanks so much for meeting with me today. i am with a group of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists working on a project to make videos about cognitive behavioral therapy which is the therapy that’s done here at this clinic. so cognitive behavior therapy is a mouthful, so i’m going to refer to it as cbt throughout this interview and we just want to get your perspective and your general thoughts about the therapy. so to start, could you tell me what comes to mind when you think of or hear cbt?",cbt? um well it is a technique used for the treatment of variety psychiatric psychological disorders where you try to use graded… graded and guided approaches to modify the responses and the anxiety associated with particular types of responses often through exposure or other sorts of i guess controlled environments and providing a safe environment for individuals to…i guess uh… become cognitively aware of their physiological responses to adverse stimuli that cause them anxiety or distress.
3001,3001_082.txt,0,0.6016668081283569,"so that sounds like there’s, to sum everything up, it sounds like there are a lot of skills that are learned in cbt and that these are things are used to challenge anxiety.","well i think… i mean i think the goal of it is to ultimately give individual… i guess tools whether they’re behavioral tools to help deal with you know whatever their adverse reactions are or their anxieties to teach them approaches and method that will work for them when they are not there. so i think there are combinations of both… you know guided exposures, but then also demonstrating how they can utilize those in the future.  ___ it can be used alone or in combination with…you know pharmacological therapy."
3001,3001_082.txt,0,0.4825344681739807,"03: 58it sounds like yeah a lot of ways and techniques that you can combat anxiety with cbt. so speaking of anxiety, one of the major goals of cognitive behavior therapy is to kind of challenge anxiety. in your own words, if someone were to ask you how anxiety becomes problematic in someone’s life, how would you response? what would your explanation of that be?","well i think anxiety if it leads to an adverse effect on your welfare whether that yours ability to function in school or in work or their home life or in their relationships then i would say that the anxiety is of you know concern. i think that can be difficult to define. how does anxiety specifically lead to adverse effects? i think that it depends on the different type of anxiety and what they and what their specifically concerned about…  _____ it sort of depends on, but overall how it affects the individual and their function."
3001,3001_082.txt,0,0.6093576550483704,could you give me some examples of potentially how because i know you mention that it does varies on the anxiety. what are some ways you think that could look like?,social anxiety if you are anxious about social interaction it could lead you to avoid situations where you are going to have to interact with individuals and… so that could make it difficult for you at work or more extreme cases. you know not being able to carry out normal daily functions. so i think those are one type of anxiety.

3001,3001_082.txt,0,0.33503302931785583,that’s where you say it varies based upon the person really.,i think also anxiety can often contribute to other psychiatric disorders like depression. it could coincident with other disorders… exacerbate their… manifestations.

3001,3001_083.txt,0,0.5207887291908264,"in what ways was that unexpected umm, like in what ways was that unexpected for you? it sounds like there was a different preconception kind of going in to thinking what it would look like.","i think that my preconception is essentially stress them out until the anxiety subsides and that they don’t… you know that’s a difficult process because you have induce the anxiety in order to show that’s it’s not going to cause harm or the adverse  ___ are anticipated are not actually going to happen, and to me that worries me from what i think. from what i heard there was a lot of humor, a lot of ways to sort of deescalate the situation and made it a less unpleasant situation than i would have expected."
3001,3001_083.txt,0,0.6644198298454285,is that kind of the knowledge you acquired about it there being more perhaps to cbt than just the kind of like the mechanism side of things. is that something that would be important for other parents to know if they are contemplating whether or not to have their child go through cbt?,"when you say the mechanisms, do you mean like neurochemical reprogramming or do you mean the mechanisms in terms of what actually happens in cbt?"
3001,3001_083.txt,0,0.4605489671230316,"i think more the latter where in terms of you expose yourself to a stimulus to induce anxiety and then learn that the feared outcome is not actually happening, but you mention that also there seems to be some fun involved and there were other things that made it..","yeah i think that would be helpful.  i mean i think that would also depend on the skill of the practitioner. unrelated thing, my older son wasn’t treated here a long time ago… you know had a run with cbt and it worked. it was more difficult for him. so i think it sort of depends on… it can be dependent on the skill of the practitioner or it may also be dependent on the individual child and how difficult it is to them to deal with so. yeah, but i think understanding that it is not going to solely an unpleasant experience both for the child and the parent. i think it is helpful. although again, i think there has to be some realistic expectations, and i mean i guess it also depends on the cbt whether how much they are going to have an expectation that the parent is going to be involved. i think often… therapy is relatively limited and you are going to have to have more outside parental involvement. so i think that can be challenging for parents. it can be difficult to them to put their child in that situation. it is unpleasant for them. so um yeah… it goes against sort of your parental instincts. so i think that can be a challenge that kind of needs to be made clear to parents. that sometimes you are going to be asked or told to do things that are not what you would think, you know. protecting your child is not always… the best way to move forward. i mean i guess the other thing is consistency…. and um yeah providing consistency because i think that’s important and i think that’s really hard, especially when you are dealing with two different parents. i don’t know. i think that’s getting off topic… i think yeah it’s obviously very helpful to have parents understand what the processes as well as the child. what are the things that they are going to have to confront as they go forward and i don’t know?"
3001,3001_084.txt,0,0.6576755046844482,"well what would you are some of those things that they would have to confront? like what… you were giving some good advice to kind of parent in terms of what to expect, but are there any sorts of specific types of things you’d say would be really useful kind of like as heads-up when some is first entering therapy, like what they should know of in order to be successful.","well i think that the point about… that you are going to… the therapy may contradict your parental instincts. i think that’s important for parents to know. yeah i mean i think you would have to be able to sit also with your child’s anxiety as well i guess which is similar to that. i think that it’s helpful to know that it will work, you know and i think ….  i think having something about that it at least for some cases it, it is most effective therapy. what else, umm… yeah it’s not going to be always unpleasant. that’s the other thing is sort of the kids are quite are happy too, and they make progress. so i think that’s in some cases true, depends on the child i guess. umm yeah i don’t know. that’s everything i would probably say."

3001,3001_085.txt,0,0.5566783547401428,without saying cbt…. or maybe three alternatively three words that come to mind in general when thinking about it.,controlled exposure to reduce anxiety. that’s more than three. controlled exposures or anxiety.
3001,3001_085.txt,0,0.4331432282924652,okay. so very much about the exposure side in terms of dealing with anxiety. it’s kind of the big thing that comes to mind when you think about it.,it is yeah. i mean i know that’s a component of it.
3001,3001_085.txt,0,0.5348672270774841,"ok um so i want to transition a little bit as i said at the beginning we’re making some videos. a lot of these questions are meant to guide the creation of the videos, but more explicitly i wanted to ask you know… these videos were meant to be for the general audience we potentially may have parental videos and then kid videos or it may just be that they’re both um, but from your perspective who do you think should be in these videos? like what type of characters should be included?",what type of character?
3001,3001_085.txt,0,0.4249407649040222,right so you know and thinking about this should there be non-human characters and animals. should there be…,"no i don’t, no. i think it depends on your audience. for young children maybe you know. animation or whatever, but for anybody 12 or older i would think that most compelling is going to be individuals who have gone through it talk about their experiences or whatever. that would be my thought"
3001,3001_085.txt,0,0.5374211072921753,"ok, so people who have gone through it. so like patients it sounds like. patients who have experienced this.","mmhmm, yeah."
3001,3001_086.txt,0,0.6194835305213928,how would you feel about doctors or therapist treating them? would you also include them in these videos?,"yeah, i think so. i mean i think i would not start with therapist. i would start with patients and their parents."
3001,3001_086.txt,0,0.4710584580898285,so parents are important too.,if it’s appropriate for age. i mean i guess that questions what age you are talking about.
3001,3001_086.txt,0,0.5649675726890564,so i think just for some information it’s meant to be designed for 10 to 16 year olds which is arrange because obviously 10 year olds differ a lot from 16 year olds and there also the parents on top of it.,yeah i would just make sure to have an age range of kids. i would start with the kids and their experience and then i would only you know… i guess it depends on who you are trying to convince. if you are trying to bring in kids then i would have them talk about their experiences first.
3001,3001_086.txt,0,0.585918128490448,"for the parental side, what do you think would be best for like a parent?",i think… yeah seeing kids and other parents is good.  ___ parental experience in there as well.

3001,3001_086.txt,0,0.599856972694397,i’m curious can you tell me why you lean towards like the home as opposed to a medical office or to a doctor’s office.,"well 99% of your time you are in the home. 99% of the time you are dealing with issues there.  ___ and your looking how is your life going to be outside of there you know.  i think it’s maybe appropriate when you are talking to a clinician or whoever and say ok you know these are tools we used, these are the things we do, or whatever. we have that in a clinical setting, but i think putting people in a clinical setting turns them into patients rather than people. so i think if you want to appeal to people put in a home setting, not a clinical setting."
3001,3001_086.txt,0,0.6988895535469055,it’s not medicalized,yup. they are not patients. they are people.
3001,3001_086.txt,0,0.4666706323623657,in that line uh kids especially are spending a lot of time in school. how would you feel like school being in the background?,"i mean school would be an appropriate environment. i think sometimes though these... i think it would need to be dependent on what the specific anxiety is or specific issue that they are dealing with. i don’t think especially that age, i don’t know. middle school for sure. i’m not sure.  i mean i think are… less likely to be open about their issues that they are dealing with so. i think it can even be anxiety producing for some individuals. i think you know to some extent it would helpful to have it in a safe at least or what would be perceived as a safe environment for children."
3001,3001_087.txt,0,0.5300490856170654,ok. um looking at the subject matter what they will be talking about. what do you think will be the most impactful subject in terms of what type of things will be spoken in the video?,"i don’t know. i mean i think it will be important to have a range of issues and different types of issues and different  ___.  and i think that it is important to have arc and kind of showing how individuals sort of are able to progress and you know how they felt before, where they’re going, and you know how they felt about the process along the way. so i think those are important. i don’t know how much time you have umm yeah. so i think a variety of ages. i think you know things that are… you know i would have a range of concerns from common to quite unusual."
3001,3001_087.txt,0,0.6345793604850769,"so it sounds like there should be breathe in terms of what’s spoken about and also like as you mentioned arc, more of a story rather than just information being thrown kind of at the viewer. that’s what i’m hearing.","yeah i think an arc is helpful because at least it says ok you know it doesn’t necessarily have to be a completed arc and i think in some ways that often would be important not say this is done, but ok this is what it was like before. it was really difficult. this is what we did, you know. this is how the parents helped and dealt with it. this is where we are know, you know. go forward from here whatever. so not… i think that’s helpful right i mean because…. i think if you just talk about the process and not show what the outcomes are it won’t be very helpful."

3001,3001_087.txt,0,0.5653907060623169,or our ras are transcribing so,so...
3001,3001_087.txt,0,0.5343928933143616,"one last question about the what in the video. in terms about talking how cbt works, do you think that’s something that’s a good thing to put in the videos?","yeah i think not detailed you know, but i think sort of…. you know illustrations on how anxiety levels go up and then repeated exposures can decrease. i think things like that are helpful kind of just explain to them what the overall theories and ideas are. i think that would be helpful to give them some, you know idea what the process is and what to expect, you know."
3001,3001_087.txt,0,0.36435699462890625,and um in...,and that everything is going to be different depending on the individuals and anxiety.
3001,3001_087.txt,0,0.43784627318382263,"right. sounds like a lot of that is you know something you said throughout kind of like it is very individualized for different people and it varies. not one size fits all. in terms of how the video should look, we have a few different styles i just want you to take a look at and i’m curious if there is any one, there’s just three of them, if there’s any one in particular that stands out more than the others, or one that you really don’t like.","what, what is it you are trying to do."
3001,3001_087.txt,0,0.3303370475769043,"so this one the first option would be line art. so it would be pretty live-action and then it would have people able to draw, and there would be special effects where we can digitally alter it so people look like they are drawing things and __  different line arts. so that’s the first option.",um i don’t know…. i’m not totally fond of that idea.
3001,3001_088.txt,0,0.48975738883018494,"ok, the second is more of what you would typically see as a cartoon. something that you see, there are a lot of youtube videos, instructional videos. that type of style.","interesting. i don’t know i mean i guess i’m…. i don’t know. i guess i’m not necessarily overly excited about the idea of um… i don’t know potentially maybe the vector art. i don’t know i guess i’m just… i can understand that. i just don’t understand why you need the other things rather than just having individuals, children talk about it."
3001,3001_088.txt,0,0.43818777799606323,so it sounds like more of just kind of like doing general filming without having special effects. do you think it’s sufficient?,i don’t know. it certainly would be my preference.
3001,3001_088.txt,0,0.4833059310913086,it would be your preference. okay.,i mean if i’m looking at stuff. i think i just fine it. i don’t know distracting.
3001,3001_088.txt,0,0.43065011501312256,"ok, ummm what should the take home message of the videos be? like if there was one thing to really emphasize.",well i think the thing to take home is that it works and that it takes time…. you are not going to lose anything from trying. it is a collaboration between individual and parents and the you know the therapist. it’s not going to work out without all three being involved.
3001,3001_088.txt,0,0.38934484124183655,35: 11ok! is there anything you want to add in terms of wrapping up? any last thing you think is important for us to know…,i don’t think i’m an average... i don’t think i’m uh… i think i have a larger role. i may know more than what most parents will know so i think that i have a skewed perspective.

3001,3001_088.txt,0,0.41986483335494995,"so learning ways to manage how you think. so it sounds like there’s definitely a lot of… a lot of it is about thoughts, would you say?",yes. i would say yes.

3001,3001_088.txt,0,0.42254629731178284,okay. from where had you heard it from before?,"when i first started hearing about it, it was after the gulf war. it developed as a way to kind of help you deal with stress after post-traumatic stress and such. i’ve known others who have kind of used it as a way of therapy."

3001,3001_089.txt,0,0.4262876808643341,so it’s not necessarily an instant thing? as nice as that would be?,"right. it would be nice. i don’t know if adults, but it was proved that kids, it seems takes a while for kids to kind of get that relationship with a therapist. it would be nice if we were all really truthful when we went to the doctor. that was one of my favorite shows that i used to watch was doctor house. everybody lies- i hope that’s not true. i suspect for kids maybe it’s not that easy to be fully truthful in the beginning."

3001,3001_089.txt,0,0.41229596734046936,____ talked about earlier how you’re identifying things that may not be the most useful for yourself,yeah.

3001,3001_090.txt,0,0.67643141746521,"right, definitely. could you tell me a little bit about the... you touched on this a little briefly… about challenging negative thoughts… what are some other areas that cbt targets? what skills do you develop from it?","not just challenging negative thoughts, but also, i think was part of it, recognizing maybe when you are more, i think anxiety… when you are feeling moments of anxiety, if you can recognize that, then you can draw from things you learned in cbt to help you manage it better."
3001,3001_090.txt,0,0.4863159656524658,so a little bit like a toolkit.,"yeah, yeah. or almost like exercising a little bit, build up your strength."

3001,3001_091.txt,0,0.5414173007011414,"that makes sense. so transitioning a little bit to the setting, what would be some good settings that we could have the video in?","i guess maybe more of a reenactment. maybe you might start with a scene where somebody is encountering some kind of mental health challenge, and maybe that’s the starting point so you can identify what type of challenges people would have and then transition into entering therapy. i don’t know how long this video is going to be… transitioning into what kind of benefits you can bring through therapy or cbt and then finally having the final result of the miraculous cure- something to see the benefit out of it."

3001,3001_096.txt,0,0.4766758978366852,"so do you think we should include how cbt, the explanation of how anxiety can become a problem in someone’s life, and do you think that should be discussed in the video as well?","yeah. the why, the general why you should go to  ___ how it can help, yes."
3001,3001_096.txt,0,0.620013415813446,okay. should we ask how it has worked for other kids?,if it has worked?
3001,3001_096.txt,0,0.4892462491989136,yeah. how or if it has worked for other kids.,yeah.
3001,3001_096.txt,0,0.5211048126220703,should we ask about how exposures work?,maybe? in the first video?  _____
3001,3001_096.txt,0,0.4816291928291321,there’s no right or wrong answer it’s based upon parents’ perspective. what you feel you would’ve wanted to see.,probably not initially.
3001,3001_096.txt,0,0.41541948914527893,not initially. okay. should we ask about what parents can or can’t do to help?,yes. definitely.
3001,3001_096.txt,0,0.5099591016769409,why would you say definitely?,because that’s always helpful. suggestions and expectations.
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.4419648349285126,"good to know. so now we’re going to talk about the how. so how the video will look like. we have 3 options of artistic styles. 1 being the line art option, 2 being vector art, and 3 being the comic art blended with live action, and so i’ll give you a second to look through them and have some questions for you later. you can let me know when you’ve looked through them and understand them- the concept of all three of them.",okay.
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.7094559669494629,"okay so before we get started on that, i have to ask you: are there any cartoons or animated movies that you personally like? try to list them off, what are some of them?","sure. well we’re a big animation fam so of course, disney and pixar. we actually have a lot of anime as well. anything from pokémon to avatar."
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.4770272970199585,so you’re big on animation?,"yeah. our family is, yeah."
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.6994027495384216,so all of the above?,pretty much.
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.5845339894294739,"okay so based on the styles you see, the three options, which one would you choose? which one do you like the most, more so?",personally? or which one do i think should be used in a video for kids?
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.5042198896408081,personally.,"personally, i like line art best of these three."
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.5524868369102478,line art. why does it appeal to you the most?,simplified. gets the point across. it’s just less distracting.
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.5253103971481323,"okay, so it’s clear and concise. it sounds like you had two options…",vector art would be the second.
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.7111651301383972,"vector art would be your second option? okay, so it sounds like you had two options: you had a personal option and one for children if you could choose that one. so which one would you choose for children if you had the option?",they’d probably take better to vector art.
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.37116196751594543,okay and why do you think that is?,it’s more common to what they see. they don’t see a lot of the line art. the doodles and stuff like that.
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.4227234423160553,"okay, that’s good to know. what do you think the take home messages from the video should be?","trying to get them excited about coming. it has to be honest, that it’s not easy, like there’s going to be work to it, but it’s all worth it to give it a try."
3001,3001_097.txt,0,0.4284285604953766,"sounds good, and is there anything you feel like i missed? anything important that i haven’t asked about that you feel we need to take into account?","i don’t think so. i mentioned the whole confidentiality part, because kids are often afraid to say something. i can’t think of anything else."
