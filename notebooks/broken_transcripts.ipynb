      "Okay. As you know, this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question will be what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "What term?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",

      "Whatever.\n",

      "I don't have any particular term.\n",

      "That's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",

      "What?\n",

      "Your racial identification?\n",

      "Okay.\n",
      "Then what was your highest degree or level of school you've completed?\n",

      "Four years of college, bachelors.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is your household income?\n",
      "It can be in a range.\n",

      "It can be in a range.\n",

      "Aww.\n",
      "Oh, well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Then the last question is which geographic region best describes where you live in the US?\n",
      "I have northeast, Midwest, south or west.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "Southeast.\n",
      "Florida.\n",
      "I guess that would be south.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "The next portion of the interview is more conversation style.\n",
      "It's separated into a few different topics.\n",
      "This first one is about behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "Can you please describe your clutter problems and how long they've been going on?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I can't remember not ever having a problem.\n",
      "I mean, having problems with it.\n",
      "I always collected things right from when I was very young.\n",
      "I've always had lots of stuff around in my room.\n",
      "I had tons of different kinds of collections.\n",
      "Just because I enjoyed so many different things.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "All my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Would you say your behavior is severe?\n",
      "Do you believe it's a problem or not?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Going in and out of that through my life ...\n",
      "Now that I'm hitting retirement I'm realizing I've got to clean out and let go of stuff.\n",
      "I'm starting to work through that.\n",
      "It's an effort but I need to so I'm working on changing that behavior now.\n",
      "There are other times it's been out of control and it's difficult to deal with but right now I'm at the place of dealing with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It's gone through periods of being severe and then you've worked on it a bit?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever gone or sought professional treatment?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Not for it.\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you did go through periods of change was it kind of instigated yourself?\n",
      "Like you felt you needed to do something or did maybe your husband say something?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "At different times ...\n",
      "Right now, it's myself.\n",
      "In the past, there have been times that my husband said something or someone else has said something.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's been so many years.\n",
      "When I was a kid my mom would say something.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Then I would deal with it but, currently, it's myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned that your family has said something before.\n",
      "How do they feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Has it ever caused conflicts between you guys?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Not a terrible conflict.\n",
      "Of course, I wouldn't like hearing it or I don't want to deal with it but I do.\n",
      "Initially, resistance but never real super conflict.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It's kind of been like you might have been irritated or angry but it was resolved?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This next section is going to be talking about your space and your living area.\n",
      "Can you please describe where you live now and what the space looks like?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Where I live now?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Not like geographically.\n",
      "Like what kind of house or apartment.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "We live in a single story house.\n",
      "A number of rooms and all of the rooms have lots of stuff in them.\n",
      "I mean, we can certainly move around and things.\n",
      "It's not preventing us from using our rooms.\n",
      "Sometimes I have to move things around in order to do that but each room has lots of stuff in it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Not ....\n",
      "You know, like bookshelves and up and around.\n",
      "I do have boxes on some floors.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "It's not like you hear about where people walk in and the place is so full it falls over.\n",
      "It's not like that at all.\n",
      "It's very mild.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You would consider your home cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't have people over because it's cluttered.\n",
      "It's not straight.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any parts of your home that you don't use for their intended purpose?\n",
      "Do you have a bathroom maybe that you just use for storage?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. Well, our guest room, we use for storage but it's not so bad that when we do have a guest it's easily cleaned out and moved around.\n",
      "We use each room for what its intended purpose.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about your kitchen?\n",
      "Are you able to use the counter spaces and stuff or would you say it's cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "It's cluttered.\n",
      "I mean, we have spots open to be able to do that but the counters are full.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "The general idea that I'm getting is that you just might have a few boxes in each room that makes it a little cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah and stuff on top, top of stuff on top of stuff.\n",
      "That kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is it like mostly papers or is it furniture or are there just boxes of items like vases or bowls or something like that?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Knick knacks.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "All of the above.\n",
      "Everything.\n",
      "Papers.\n",
      "I'm going through those now.\n",
      "Books.\n",
      "Knick knacks that I've collected.\n",
      "Things that ...\n",
      "Well, from the various places I've worked that are just sitting on boxes on top of areas and that I haven't gone through.\n",
      "I don't want to deal with it.\n",
      "It's just a lot of knick knacks.\n",
      "A lot of dust collectors.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "What about your bedroom?\n",
      "Is there stuff on your bed or are you able to use the bed and use the closet and everything like that?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Nothing on the bed.\n",
      "There are boxes on the floor.\n",
      "Closet's pretty full but everything does have a place and we can get around and everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Our bureaus are covered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like in an ideal world?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Everything straight, a lot less of the knick knacks, although I don't know how I'm going to get rid of any of them because I like them all.\n",
      "Just more straightened up.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "A lot narrowed down from what I've collected so that we can see them and enjoy them more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "That's the problem.\n",
      "I like all the stuff.\n",
      "To me, I guess you would say it's pretty important.\n",
      "I can't decide what to get rid of because it makes up the home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Which objects are most important for you?\n",
      "Which ones do you spend most of your time with?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I don't spend any time with any of them other than looking at them.\n",
      "Well, books, I guess would be ... I don't know.\n",
      "I don't spend any particular time on any one thing because I flip from thing to thing to thing because constantly changing my attention.\n",
      "Well, I mean, I'm just now stopping work so that takes up most of your day.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "I guess I spend most of my time on the computer at this point and just enjoying the stuff but I don't spend any time on it.\n",
      "I guess gardening but that's a whole different subject.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You'd say you spend most of your free time gardening and then on the computer?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, it's also that it has to get done too.\n",
      "Free time, at this point, yeah, it's actually on the computer.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you think about your possessions, what makes them available?\n",
      "How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "If it fits the collection or if it was given by somebody, it has sentimental value, I guess really.\n",
      "Other than the books that were fun to read.\n",
      "It depends on the item.\n",
      "Mostly sentiment or if it's an area that I have enjoyed or have interest in makes it valuable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's more like your own personal value to it?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then what do you consider trash or what do you discard?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "What's discard?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I guess if it doesn't really ...\n",
      "If somebody gives me something that doesn't really fit, it takes a long time for me to get rid of it because somebody has given it to me but eventually if it finally is not in good condition or doesn't fit whatever collection or whatever, I can get rid of it.\n",
      "If it's papers and has no value, not needed anymore, I can get rid of those.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I guess it's condition and whether or not it fits.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you say when it fits your collection, what kind of collections do you have?\n",
      "What's an item that wouldn't fit in your collection that you'd feel okay getting rid of?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, okay.\n",
      "One of the collections are nesting dolls.\n",
      "If somebody gives me a set of nesting dolls that I don't really care for, I will get rid of it after a period of time.\n",
      "Right now, there's very little room anyway so it's kind of ... I don't go out and buy them anymore.\n",
      "I don't go ...\n",
      "Unless they're really, really special ones.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "For instance, I don't care for Santa Claus.\n",
      "My son gave me a Santa Claus set.\n",
      "Well, took about 10 years but I got rid of one set and have another one I'll get rid of eventually.\n",
      "I don't want to hurt his feelings either but that kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Why is that one valuable?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "The most precious?\n",
      "I can't say that there's any one particular because I have so many I like.\n",
      "My most precious possessions are my family and my cat.\n",
      "As far as items are concerned, they all have value to me in one way or another.\n",
      "You know, if we had a fire and we were running out and I had to grab one thing, other than the computer and my phone and the cat, there isn't probably one in particular that I would grab above anything else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No singular thing is coming to your mind beside your computer and your phone and your cat?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No. Not in any of the collections because I like them all pretty equally.\n",
      "There's not one item above others.\n",
      "That includes pictures, paintings and other things too that we have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there one collection that you value more than another?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "There may be pieces of each collection, like in the nesting dolls.\n",
      "There's one set that is highly valuable, in a sense, to me, because of its ornateness, how it was made, and there's one or two in my other collections that I have a lot of different collections so they're specific.\n",
      "Actually, I guess I have to take that back.\n",
      "I have a pair of handmade dolls from Hungary that were made in the war and made by somebody who has the same name as my mom.\n",
      "Those are sentimentally quite valuable to me.\n",
      "I think those would be the thing I would grab before anything else.\n",
      "Which collection of things?\n",
      "It depends on my mood.\n",
      "I'm constantly changing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What would be my favorite collection right now would change in a few minutes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would happen if you lost those dolls that you said are really valuable to you?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "What would happen?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like how would you feel?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I don't know how to ...\n",
      "All I can relate to is when my cousin, their house burned down and they lost a lot of things that were valuable to them, one of which was a Japanese doll.\n",
      "I mean, it was a family heirloom and all of us mourned over that one but you get over it.\n",
      "There's nothing you can do about it so you have to move on.\n",
      "It'd be depressing but if I lost it, it'd be because there was a whole lot of other things being lost too.\n",
      "It'd be painful.\n",
      "It'd be very painful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right.\n",
      "Do you think you have too much stuff at the moment?\n",
      "How do you know when you have too much?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No more room.\n",
      "Stuff put away in boxes that you never even look at because there's so much stuff.\n",
      "Why have it if you don't have it out and enjoying it?\n",
      "You get to that point and there's just plain no more place to put stuff.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You're kind of limited by your physical dimensions of your house?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you moved into a bigger house, you would just ...\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Oh, man.\n",
      "Means more stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Actually we're at the point now where we're going to decrease in size and I have to face the reality of what do I do?\n",
      "What do I get rid of?\n",
      "What do I keep?\n",
      "That's going to be a big challenge in the next year or so?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Kind of going off of that, if you have to choose between items, how do you choose?\n",
      "How are you going to make that decision?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I don't know yet.\n",
      "That's what I'm trying to figure out.\n",
      "I'm trying to go through.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "We just went through it with my mom and it was so hard for us even to handle getting rid of her stuff and my father's stuff.\n",
      "Now that's all added in here.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I have no idea how I'm going to do it.\n",
      "I really don't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Were you able to get rid of anything when you were going through their items?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "The things that just were falling apart and stuff.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There were things that nobody wanted of my parents.\n",
      "Those we did get rid of.\n",
      "The things that were sentimental to us all, those we all kept.\n",
      "Even if they were in bad condition.\n",
      "I'm talking about my siblings.\n",
      "We just added it to our piles.\n",
      "I have my piles.\n",
      "They have theirs.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do your siblings collect as much as you do?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. One of them does.\n",
      "The rest don't.\n",
      "No. My baby sister and I both have issues with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Did your parents collect a lot also?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So did our grandparents.\n",
      "It's genetic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You'd say a lot of your family members then [crosstalk 00:29:31].\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, I mean, not of my siblings but, yes, generational.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving habits, just collecting, and hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, collecting, you're able to choose what's ...\n",
      "In my mind, choose what's valuable and keep that and let go of other things.\n",
      "I think of folks who collect rocks and they go to rock shows and they buy and sell.\n",
      "My dad, it was with birding equipment and telescopes and stuff.\n",
      "He didn't hang on and collect them all and not get rid of them.\n",
      "He traded, moved, gave away, whatever.\n",
      "Just had the ones that he specifically needed for a particular time.\n",
      "Same with rock collecting or any of the others.\n",
      "You hang onto the ones you want and trade out the ones you don't want.\n",
      "But hoarding, you just keep it all.\n",
      "Valuable or not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "What does hoarding look like?\n",
      "How is it the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, fortunately, I feel like I don't have a very bad issue with it because I can still walk around the house but hoarding, yeah, I just picture the stories you hear where it's so bad that it's physically dangerous.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I guess whether or not ...\n",
      "If they talk about always needing to get or have or you see them taking things that you know they really don't need, however, you see them, in conversation.\n",
      "At work, we can see a couple of folks who just would take things ...\n",
      "Not steal but ... I work at a church.\n",
      "Things that may be donated, they would hang onto them, whether they needed it or not or just take excess amounts whether they need it or not.\n",
      "I guess there are signs but not always.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned previously about stories you hear.\n",
      "Where have you gotten information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "What have you heard about it?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "You hear things on the news about people either dying and couldn't get into the house or you hear reports about things like that.\n",
      "That, of course, is a common theme in various TV shows, which they exaggerate everything but I guess mainly the real things would be the news reports when someone is discovered as being a hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You don't personally seek out any information?\n",
      "You just hear it when it comes on the news?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What do you think about, specifically, when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "You know, just basically, somebody who just plain cannot get rid of stuff.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. This next section is going to be talking about distress.\n",
      "Would you say your behavior upsets you?\n",
      "Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "At times, it does.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It upsets me that I can't get rid of things.\n",
      "It can get destructive.\n",
      "It can interfere with being able to do stuff because stuff is in the way and I have to take time to move it around in order to do something else or whatever but the main thing I think is just constantly seeing things cluttered and not being able to do anything about it and just adding more stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Can you think of a time that it ever really got in the way of something you wanted or is it more of a day to day kind of interference?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "It's just a day to day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned previously that your husband has mentioned before like, \"Oh, maybe it's time to get rid of things.\"\n",
      "Has it ever significantly impacted your relationship?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "He kind of knew that you liked to collect the nesting dolls and other things like that from the moment you guys started a relationship?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think it ever affected your work?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. I kept things pretty organized there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, it didn't affect work ... I had a lot of stuff that I should have gotten rid of over the years.\n",
      "Of course, I had to once I'm retiring now but it didn't get in the way.\n",
      "It didn't affect anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Was it ever brought up as a concern with any of your coworkers or anything?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you were growing up, did it ever impact your relationship with your siblings?\n",
      "Did you guys ever fight over stuff?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "That's a long time ago.\n",
      "I suppose here and there we would or if my brothers got irritated and wanted to agitate they'd go in and do something with my collections or something.\n",
      "This, of course, would be very maddening, especially when they broke something.\n",
      "I can't say that we ever really fought over anything because they didn't have the same interests.\n",
      "They didn't care.\n",
      "My sisters and I were far enough apart that it didn't really enter our relationship at all.\n",
      "Usually they enjoyed it too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It was more typical of sibling behavior.\n",
      "Just getting mad and maybe taking someone's stuff but not really impacting it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What about your parents?\n",
      "Did your parents ever get mad about your collections or threaten to take something away?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. I can't say that they ever did.\n",
      "They actually built me bookshelves so I'd have room to put stuff.\n",
      "Sometimes they would encourage whatever it was I was collecting.\n",
      "Some of them were pretty weird but I can't say that they ever were bothered by it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Then my last question about this, was there ever a time maybe in college that you had a roommate that you guys ever got in disagreements about clutter or did you pretty much live at home and then lived with your husband?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, actually, in high school I was in a boarding school.\n",
      "By choice.\n",
      "I had three different roommates.\n",
      "We didn't really have any real issues back then that I can remember.\n",
      "We weren't allowed to have much stuff.\n",
      "We had constant inspections and stuff.\n",
      "That kind of helped keep things in control.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I just kept all that stuff at home.\n",
      "When I'd go home, take it home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I didn't go away to college.\n",
      "I was married by that point.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It seems like overall it didn't really impact any of your relationships, whether that was family, romantic, or work at all.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Kind of my last question is would you like to change permanently or do you think this is always going to be a phase where you kind of get rid of stuff and then you might collect a little more and you have to go through periods of change?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I'll always struggle with it.\n",
      "I'll always want stuff and collect stuff.\n",
      "I'm sure even now and going into my next phase of life because I enjoy stuff.\n",
      "I enjoy having it around me.\n",
      "I can't imagine not ever having stuff around me and collecting and stuff.\n",
      "I think of my niece who has a completely bare house because she likes it that way.\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "No knick knacks.\n",
      "Hardly any furniture.\n",
      "Just completely bare house.\n",
      "I'm the exact opposite but I like having ...\n",
      "It makes me feel good.\n",
      "I enjoy seeing it.\n",
      "I can't imagine ever not being that way but it would be nice to be able to control it better so it's not so overwhelming.\n",
      "I'd like to change that I'm not interested in so many different things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever thought about seeking professional help with this?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Not about this area.\n",
      "Other areas, depression and stuff, yes, I have but those are sort of get those under control and then this would be under control is kind of my thinking.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That pretty much concludes ...\n",
