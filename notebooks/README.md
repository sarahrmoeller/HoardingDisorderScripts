# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains `*.ipynb` files that are each designed to either test our code or explore the data in some way.

Some of the code in these files may not work, as they were initially run while within in the root directory. 
If you have issues running the code, it may help to move the `*.ipynb` file you're working with into the root directory and see if that helps.
