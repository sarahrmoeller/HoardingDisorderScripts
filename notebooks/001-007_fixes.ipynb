And how do you go about explaining hoarding disorder-- How would you, to a patient with low insight?\\nInterviewee: Uhm really try to hammer home the impairment that they have.\\nSo, the way that they can actually identify as the reasons that they would actually want to reduce the clutter or want to reduce, you know, their acquiring or other things.\\nUhm like if their family member won’t bring over, won’t go over, bring their kids over, or if their clutter is preventing them from getting needed repairs or their-- You know the really, kind of- staying on those kinds of features that are really impairing their lives.\\nInterviewer: Ok.\\nAnd kind of hitting it from that angle, have you found, in your experience, helps patients to be able to gain insight, making that connection to the consequences?\\nInterviewee: Uhm yeah.\\nI think for most of them, they get- they have more insight when thinking about the consequences that are tied in with it.',\n",
       " '002_020.txt': 'Interviewer: Okay, can you think of an example of a specific case or cases where you personally had trouble making diagnostic decisions, either whether it was true hoarding or subclinical hoarding, or whether it was hoarding or something else.\\nInterviewee: Yeah, where that\\'s why I kind of like your art example because in reality, I feel like that rarely happens.\\nAlmost always, I\\'d say 99% of the time, I\\'m pretty clear about whether it\\'s hoarding or not.\\nI guess the only times I do have occasional challenges where it\\'s like, is this hoarding secondary to depression or alcohol or schizophrenia, that sometimes comes up, but not really as much related to the nature of the collection.\\nIt\\'s usually pretty clear, it\\'s disorganized, it\\'s disheveled, there might be some things of value in there, but they\\'ve gotten overwhelmed.\\nThe stuff has taken over, and they\\'re no longer in control.\\nSo, I don\\'t usually have trouble based on the stuff that they\\'re hoarding making a decision on.\\nThe bigger decisions for me are, \"Okay there\\'s some squalor happening, the person\\'s not getting out of bed, they\\'re not taking care of their functioning, is this hoarding and squalor secondary to just not being able to maintain their activities of daily living?\"\\nInterviewer: So, along those lines kind of how do you make the distinction between a person, or do you find it difficult to distinguish between a person who has a primary diagnosis or hoarding disorder versus a primary diagnosis of depression, which is causing them to not be able to throw stuff out because they\\'re too depressed to get up and do it?\\nInterviewee: Yeah, so my key question with that one is, \"Okay, if I were to come over tomorrow and throw things away to help you clear out your house, how would you feel?\" And a person with depression is usually like, \"That would be great, please do that.\"\\nYou know, maybe they would want to point out a few things to save, but they just have such apathy and overwhelmed and so depressed, they can\\'t do it.\\nBut a person who is actually hoarding would say, \"No, I don\\'t want to throw any of those things away\" or \"I would really struggle or feel really unsettled if you threw any of these things away\" and then it\\'s clear that there is that core feature of difficulty discarding and attachment.\\nSo, it\\'s not apathy that leads to inability to motivate to discard, but actual difficulty discarding.\\nThat\\'s for me the way I kind of navigate that one.',\n",

Interviewee: So they’ve become, kind of, newer hoarders.\\nInterviewer: Ok.\\nAnd you know, speaking of family, you said family and friends will often play a role in the patient coming in and identifying that something is wrong, or something is going on that needs treatment, and so just curious as to what relatives do you find are most often involved in that process with a patient?\\nInterviewee: Uh, in this program its usually extended family, not direct family.\\nSo it will be brothers and sisters, daughters and sons, rather than and husbands and wives.\\nMost of the people that we see for hoarding here are actually single or divorced, which is rather telling.\\nInterviewer: Definitely.\\nWell I think with that, that’s just about everything we wanted to ask you.\\nWe want to be really respectful of your time, so we just wanted to thank you so much for talking to us and giving us a lot of those great answers to the questions that we have.\\nWe really appreciate it.\\nInterviewee: Oh, you are very welcome.\\nYou guys are doing great work.\\nInterviewer: Thank you\\nInterviewer: Thank you, and we appreciate your insights.\\nCould I just jump in at the very end and say that one of the things we ask people to do is to think up other people, after having done the interview, that they think we should talk to?\\nSo, does anyone come to mind that you think we should definitely make sure we try to speak to for this project?\\nInterviewee: You might have already talked to them because they’re already on the [inaudible 01:02:12], but I would recommend [NAME 01:02:14] and [NAME 01:02:15] at [UNIVERSITY 01:02:17]\\n[cross talk]\\nAnd obviously [01:02:25], but I’m sure you’ve already talked to [NAME 01:02:25].\\nInterviewer: Yeah.\\nWell we appreciate, again your time and thank you so much for the answers.\\nAnd so were going to continue interviewing clinicians and researchers and then transfer to hoarders and then we’ll follow up at that conclusion to let everyone know what we have found and what we plan to do.\\nSo, thank you.\\nInterviewee: Ok, well good luck!\\nInterviewer: Thank you, take care.\\nInterviewee: Bye.\\nInterviewer: Bye.',\n",

       " '001_002.txt': 'Interviewer: And I guess in cases of animal hoarding, I remember you talking about in our last conversation that sometimes people will actually have social networks or people who are kind of supporting them in their behavior, and how does that work with this kind of delusional almost aspect of...does it become a shared delusion?\\nInterviewee: Almost a shared delusion, like we\\'ve had--in the case of our rescue hoarders, which are our most common large-scale hoarding situations, so people who at least present themselves or describe themselves as rescuers and sometimes actually formerly have a non-profit status and claim to be a rescue organization, and when they do come in conflict with the law or are charged with animal cruelty, many of the enablers or people who have assisted them will show up at their hearings and their trials and will also have the same level of denial.\\nI\\'ve had situations where we will have evidence photographs of emaciated or debilitated animals, particularly in the cats we get very severe upper respiratory infections that sometimes even cause rupturing of eyeballs and things like that, and we will have evidence photos or veterinary reports, and their supporters, enablers, defenders will basically accuse us of doctoring those photos and they basically say it\\'s fake news!\\n[laughs] So, to that extent it becomes a shared delusion.\\nInterviewer: And why do you think that happens?\\nDo you have any knowledge of how that gets built?\\nInterviewee: Well usually these are fellow hoarders.\\nIt\\'s interesting that they show up for each other\\'s trials or hearings or whatever, but they don\\'t necessarily present them with aid.\\nThey don\\'t say, \"Let me take some of these animals off of their hands, let me help you\" or \"let me get you some resources,\" they are just reinforcing the notion that they\\'re keeping all these animals under whatever condition is an act of rescue or love or whatever.\\nSo, they are enablers but they\\'re not helpers, they\\'re not...they\\'re making the situation, either perpetuating it or even exasturbating it.\\nI haven\\'t seen too many cases, although it\\'s there in the literature and I\\'ve talked to other people, sometimes the hoarders are actually competing with each other.\\nThey\\'re like, you know, literally competing for animals that they find and occasionally even stealing from each other.\\nInterviewer: So it almost appears to be a community in some cases?\\nInterviewee: Well, and that\\'s something that\\'s also I think unique to animal hoarders.\\nPart of their delusion is they feel--I guess I would consider it delusional thinking...but they are the only ones that can provide for these animals, they know best.\\nSo, there\\'s a level of narcissism and paranoia in there as well.\\nMy favorite line from a hoarder when asked why she had these dogs, many of them were in poor condition and she could reduce her population by offering some up for adoption and she was allegedly a rescue group and the best line I\\'ve ever heard was, \"I wouldn\\'t give one of my dogs to Jesus Christ if he walked in the door.\"\\nSo nobody is good enough, nobody meets their standard of care, they believe they are absolutely the best person.\\nThey usually have no respect for veterinarians, they think veterinarians don\\'t know what they\\'re doing, they certainly have no respect for animal rescue groups, so that really pathological narcissism is quite often in some of the animal hoarders as well.',\n",
       " '004_065.txt': 'Interviewee: But, what happens when you are… when you have tried and failed at something?\\nYou consider yourself a failure.\\nYou can do some sort of mental protective activities, and one of them is to define the problem away.\\nAnd so, I can define this as just the way I live, and maybe the way I want to live.\\nAnd so, if that’s the case, they’re not likely to define it as a mental problem, and they’re not likely to talk about it having a biological cause.\\nIt’s just the way they are.\\nBut if they think of it as a mental problem, then what’s the easiest way of thinking about it?\\nWell, it’s not my character, it’s some sort of disease.\\nSo, I think the explanation is kind of tied up with where they’re at with respect to insight.\\nInterviewer 1: Yeah, that’s interesting.\\nAnd, do you… have you found or do you have any speculation as to which group would be easier to treat, of those two groups?\\nInterviewee: Well, I think the treatment starts in a different place.\\nIf you understand the disease, I think you start a little farther along in the process.\\nIf you are still struggling with recognition and, you know, are defensive about it, then I think you have to start in a different place, and get them to focus on what the impact this behavior has on my life.\\nAnd only after doing that for a while can you really see that, this is something I need to do something about.\\nInterviewer 1: Ok.\\nAnd in… so it’s almost along a spectrum where considering it as a character trait may be kind of a little further behind the individual who’s thinking of it as a biological disorder.\\nInterviewee: Right, right.\\nInterviewer 1: Do you feel like in the path to treatment every individual has to come to the point where they feel that it’s a biological disorder?\\nCan there be [INAUDIBLE 8:37] that they just need to [INAUDIBLE 8:40].\\nInterviewee: No, no, I think… Yeah, I think it can be looked at easily, the problem-solving exercise, that “here’s the problem I’ve got, I’ve got to solve it.”\\nAnd you don’t really need to go into why.\\nSo, I think it helps people to think of it as biological in the sense that they don’t feel blamed by it, they don’t feel maybe as much shame, but I don’t know if that’s true for everyone but for a lot of people, I think.\\nAnd a lot of people come into treatment and want to know why, and of course we don’t have a very good answer to that.\\nAnd the biological one is an easy one to say because it’s sort of like a black box explanation, it doesn’t really say anything, you know?\\nInterviewer 1: Yeah.',\n",
       " '001_009.txt': \"Interviewer: Well it sounds like maybe it's moving in the same direction as object hoarding disorder, maybe like five or ten years ago where it's starting to be moved form this kind of like marginalized, criminalized behavior-oriented, punishment-oriented thinking towards more mental illness treatment-oriented thinking and so perhaps there will be more.\\nInterviewee: As a big difference though in object hoarding, let's say you have really messy hoarding situations, at worst that's usually going to be a civil intervention, if law gets involved it's going to be violations or code violations or so-on, it's not a criminal case; whereas with animal hoarding, if animals are dying that's criminal and that's the big difference.\\nAnother major difference between object hoarding and animal hoarding, I can't think off the top of my head of anybody that's been charged criminally for object hoarding alone.\\nAnd that was one of our other discussions today is what we're also trying to do is resolve some of the animal hoarding problems civilly rather than criminally, or both.\\nSo usually, let's say we have an animal hoarding situation, what we try to do is have essentially a seizure hearing where the animals are removed, or most of the animals are removed in a civil proceeding.\\nWe're not gonna charge you with animal cruelty, but we are going to essentially try to have you declared let's say an unfit owner, I know Florida law has knocked it on their stature, things like that but we're not filing criminal charges.\\nI've got interesting stuff, I think it was in the paper I sent, the advice from the Texas district attorney's association, they basically recommend responding to hoarding situations by combining civil and criminal prosecutions.\\nBasically, you know, you seize the animals civilly, and then if there are animal deaths or whatever, it's necessary to proceed criminally.\\nAnd more and more I think what we're gonna try to do is to resolve these as much as possible civilly, and frankly the main motivation for pursuing criminal charges is not incarceration, but to get court-mandated treatment, even though we realize #1 there's no well-identified effective treatment, and #2 there's very low compliance.\\nBut also what we try to do is if there are criminal proceedings, you try to get a long period of probation, which then lets you monitor the situation and gives you a little bit of a stick.\\nYou know, if you do go beyond your three permitted animals or whatever, it's a violation of your probation and there could otherwise be consequences.\",\n",
       " '001_008.txt': 'Interviewer: That seems to be something that\\'s a little bit different than with object hoarding is, while there\\'s these DSM-V criteria that are applied that are applied to individuals to see if they are individuals with hoarding disorder, but it seems that process of diagnosis happens quite infrequently with animal hoarding, it tends to be a situation where there either is or is not legal intervention necessary and that\\'s as far as it goes.\\nInterviewee: Did I send you, or I can send you if you don\\'t have it the article that [NAME 37:47] and I wrote on case outcomes in--\\nInterviewer: No you didn\\'t but I would love it, yeah\\nInterviewee: Do you have it?\\nInterviewer: No, I can look it up though but I would love it if you could send it to me, I spoke to [NAME 37:57].\\nInterviewee: Yeah I definitely will send it to you, it\\'s now probably we really should revisit that because obviously we\\'re much farther down the road, I should talk to [NAME 38:07] about re-doing it, it was a little difficult to put together obviously as a follow up.\\nWe followed more than 50 cases and obviously there\\'s much more psychological--that was even before the recognition of hoarding disorder, so it\\'s time to do a follow-up.\\nBut that will at least give you the early stages of recognition of the problem, what the different case outcomes were.\\nA major shift I\\'ve seen probably in the last five years and particularly since the inclusion of hoarding disorder is much less advocacy for jail time and we\\'ve all obviously pushed for that and that\\'s part of the general trend, again what we\\'re talking with the prosecutors today about is basically a trend away from incarceration in general or as someone, one of our California DAs said, \"nobody in California goes to jail anymore\" [laughs].\\nAnd of courts all the courts are pushing for well can\\'t we have intervention treatment or whatever, unfortunately we don\\'t have the magic treatment and as you well know, even in object hoarding cases the recidivism rate is still quite high and in animal hoarding seems to be even higher.',\n",
       " '004_061.txt': 'Interviewer: And kind of maybe to go along with that idea: when you meet a patient who is alleged to have very low insight, how do you help that patient try to gain insight or what do you say to them to help them to understand what’s going on with their behavior as being problematic?\\nInterviewee: Well largely I approach it using a motivational interviewing approach; and the idea there is to begin where the patient is.\\nSo what I wanna do is, I wanna find out what kind of value the person puts on their thing.\\nSo I want to know what they have collected, and I want them to tell me what these things mean to them, and I want to try to appreciate it in the same way they do.\\nSo that what I’m doing is I’m trying to put myself in their shoes and see how this object can be valuable.\\nAnd, in that way, begin to help them figure out how to evaluate the value of possession.\\nOne of the things that I have observed and it’s come out in a variety of ways and it just hits it out in some of the data that I’ve got is that when people with hoarding disorder acquire something, it goes into the home and then it is untouched after that.\\nThere is little or no interaction with possessions once they come into the home.\\nAnd I think this is part of the key to understanding the disorder.\\nThat for most of us, we process our possessions when they come into the home, we interact with them, and that interaction with our objects leads us to figure out how valuable they are.\\nBut for people with hoarding disorder, they establish that value in the acquisition and once it comes into the home, the there’s no processing that goes on with that object so there is no reevaluation of its value.\\nAnd so what I want to do is I want to start asking them about this possession that’s in front of them and what it means to them.\\nAnd so I’m not trying to get them to throw this possession away, my purpose is in understanding the value of possessions and not them making a decision about whether to throw it away or not.\\nAnd so in that way, the motivation here is sort of down the road.\\nThe real purpose here is to get them to start look at and evaluating the possession and then get to the point where we start talking about the benefits of having that possession and the costs of having that possession.\\nAnd that…apply the life context to that decision: so what does it mean to have this possession?\\nAnd what does this possession allow you to do?\\nAnd what does this possession prevent you from doing?\\nAnd in that way trying to establish the importance of change because what we want to focus on is the person’s values in life and what they value most.\\nAnd what we find when we’ve done that in treatment, it’s part of our treatment package, is they value things like everybody else does, family, friends, religion, so forth.\\nAnd yet the clutter that they have, the difficulty discarding, get in the way of achieving those values or goals.\\nAnd so this processing, part of the processing is to understand how this thing is valuable to them and how it relates to their life goals and their life’s values.\\nAnd so that’s the way I approach the motivation issue.',\n",
       " '004_060.txt': 'Interviewer: Right, okay.\\nSo that brings us to the next thing I wanted to ask you.\\nSo as part of this interview we’re using the different kind of breakdown of the concept of insight that I think is from one of your papers.\\nSo defensiveness as you already mentioned and anosognosia, overvalued ideation, indifference.\\nAnd we just kind of wanted to talk with you about your experience with people with this disorder and how… we’ve already talked about anosognosia and how that variation is very prevalent in the patients that you see and so when we talk about a problem of insight, do patients normally have, is it just overvalued ideation, to what is the extent of defensiveness or indifference?\\nAnd does the idea of indifference kind of… something that we heard from previous interviews is that when patients are indifferent, it can be difficult to distinguish hoarding disorder from disorders like depression where they’re simply indifferent to their surroundings or they don’t throw things away because they don’t care, and I wonder if you can talk through whether, kind of, insight.\\nInterviewee: Um I’m not quite sure I fully understood that.\\nHardly I think that the difference, the insight related things related to defensiveness and coping, I think.\\nUm, when I see someone saying they don’t have a problem, most often it is when you work with agencies that have a lot of contact with people with hoarding problems – health departments, INAUDIBLE [48:19] agencies, so forth.\\nTheir view of people with hoarding disorder typically is that most of them don’t have insight, but in part that’s because of who is asking the question and the purpose behind the question.\\nSo part of the insight problem has to do with the context in which the interview occurs and what information is used to make the decision.\\nSo if I go to someone’s home and they know I’m there because there’s some suspicion that there’s something wrong with them or the way they live, they are likely to be more defensive and deny a problem than if I’m talking to someone and asking them about what possessions they have that are valuable and the extent to which, the cost of having those possessions.\\nI’m not quite sure if that answers your question, but I think it speaks to this issue of insight and what it means because we treat insight as though it is a stable characteristic.\\nAnd I think in hoarding, it’s not necessarily stable and that it’s under the influence of the context in which the interaction is taking place between two people and that context has a lot to do with whether someone will deny they have a problem or admit that they have a problem.\\nAnd an example: I went on a heavy duty cleaning once with a crew in New York City with a case, a hoarding case, where the individual had been cleaned out five or six times before, so this is a repeat.\\nAnd so everyone involved knew this individual and believed that this individual had no insight into this.\\nSo I spent the day there, and much of the day I spent talking with the individual as the cleaning was going on.\\nMost of the time he was quite distressed trying to control the workers and telling them what to throw away, what not to throw away.\\nAnd so for the whole day, he was INAUDIBLE [50:36] the fact that they were doing this, that this was horrible, they shouldn’t be doing this, they didn’t have the right to be doing this, but yet there was a period of time about ten minutes long during the day where, as we discussed this in a little more, I don’t know if I would call it objective, but a little dispassionate way he did admit.\\nHe said to me that “yeah I know I keep too many things and I know this is a problem for my family and I try to control it in certain ways.”\\nHe described those ways, his family tried to help him control it but they haven’t been able to.\\nAnd then a few minutes later he was back to arguing with the crew about not throwing things away.\\nSo this was the case where, the one case where I saw very little insight for most of the day, but yet there was a period of time where this gentleman did have insight, and he was reflective and understood there’s something wrong.',\n",
       " '002_026.txt': \"Interviewer: So another example that was a real example that was given was a person who had a patient who hoarded exclusively digital media, who never deleted any emails and downloaded thousands and thousands of digital books and had hard drives filled with books that they would never read, but felt that they might someday; but, also didn't clutter their space because all of it was electronic media.\\nSo like, thousands of movies, thousands of digital content essentially.\\nAnd the clinician was perplexed because if they were physical--\\nInterviewee: Yeah, I think in that one I would get kind of pragmatic, and maybe with the millionaire as well, in the sense that we have limited clinical resources and treatment resources so, if they person is not presenting to treatment, if it's just a hypothetical thought experiment, I would not be bothering to diagnose them with hoarding disorder.\\nSame with the millionaire, but then the interesting thing to me is actually when they're coming in to treatment seeking.\\nOnce you're coming in for treatment, it's often time the case that you're having some distress or conflict about it, and at that point you've been the distress criteria and it doesn't matter if you have some weird management system, it's the clutter I guess that's the problem, not whether they're meeting interference or distress.\\nSo, I guess yeah maybe those two cases wouldn't be technically meeting for hoarding.\\nI mean, definitely the digital person I would be probably not putting them down as hoarding, even though I can see why behaviorally, in terms of their beliefs, it's mimicking that and that the treatments could be quite similar.\",\n",

So next we want to ask you some questions about the way that you think about specific things related to the DSM-5 criteria.\\nSo, I’m going to read you a phrase that we have from the criteria, and then I want to know a little bit more about your thought process as you apply two different patients.\\nSo, one of the phrases is “persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value.”\\nInterviewee: Mhm.\\nInterviewer: So, with that, how do you go about determining value?\\nWhat makes the value judgement of an individual with hoarding disorder as inappropriate?\\nInterviewee: Sure, well I mean, there are some cases that are very clear cut-- If it’s actually like garbage or, you know, food waste or things like that.\\nObviously, it’s much more clear cut and there are many items that are pretty inexpensive, like you know, that are less than a few dollars or less than a dollar that they have a bunch of-- I think that would be lower value, things that most people would probably discard unless they had an immediate plan for it, like things like toilet paper rolls or stuff like that-- Most people are going to get rid of, unless they have a certain art project that they’re going to use it for in the next couple of months or something.\\nInterviewer: Ok.\\nInterviewee: So yeah, I mean mostly value.\\nI think most people would probably agree that things are of a lower value like with under a few dollars or less than dollar, ideally.\\nInterviewer: And so that value, to you, kind of more means a monetary value as opposed to emotional or aesthetic value?\\nInterviewee: Sure.\\nI mean the emotional or aesthetic value-- Let’s say it’s greeting cards or something, where it’s from someone who is very much in their life and, you know, they have every expectation that they will continue to receive cards from them.\\nI mean, most people might save a special card or two, but not every card that they’ve gotten from the person.\\nSo that has a little bit more of when there’s a sentimental value.\\nHow many items are you keeping?\\nDo you need to keep every single one versus, you know, one or two things that remind you of the person?\\nInterviewer: Ok.\\nSo, at that point it’s not necessarily the inappropriate value judgement, so much as the amount that they have of that item?\\nInterviewee: Yeah.',\n",

       " '007_115.txt': 'Interviewer: Do you think that cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions play any role in the development of hoarding disorder?\\nInterviewee: Uhm, I mean, probably to an extent.\\nProbably to an extent that there’s a little bit more of that sense of a need to acquire things.\\nBut, I mean, I also feel like this-- Even, I mean, I also feel like a lot of the stuff that people do save or, you know, passively acquire, aren’t necessarily high-price kind of things that are really, I mean-- I think it can, with the variety of things that are out there, say every different possible kind of pen that someone could buy-- With there being a lot of unique kind of things that people could find, that maybe it increases it a little bit; but, at the same time, I think a lot of people with hoarding are more apt to go after some sort of really special thing, which usually means some sort of older thing rather than a newer thing, uhm, like a vintage kind of thing rather than a brand- lots of brand new stuff.\\nSo, I don’t know how much it really causes a big issue.\\nBut, I mean, I guess certainly, in terms of people’s abilities to acquire new things, with there being stores everywhere and the ability to buy things online and on TV or things like that, certainly can increase.\\nBut, not everyone has that issue with actually acquiring new things that they are paying for, you know, they- a lot of people just passively acquire things.\\nInterviewer: Ok.\\nSo those that do may experience an increased ability to purchase, but, in terms of the saving, it’s not really the same type of things that are being advertised and associated with value that people with hoarding disorder seem to be collecting.\\nInterviewee: Right, right.\\nInterviewer: Ok.\\nUh so now you know, we had mentioned in one of the Free Listing Prompts reasons that people might come in for treatment and you mentioned family distress, and financial issues, and trouble with local authorities, so do you feel like their preventing for treatment is normally self-motivated or by others?\\nInterviewee: A lot of the times its motivated by others.\\nThey might get to a point where they recognize that they can’t do it on their own and then ultimately, they have some motivation in it as well.\\nI’ve definitely had a lot of folks who have come in, mostly because their family members have really urged them to do so.\\nThey don’t really stay if they are not really willing to do the work.\\nInterviewer: Yeah.\\nSo how long has the hoarding behavior typically been going on before you see patients?\\nInterviewee: Usually for at least a couple of decades.\\nInterviewer: Wow.\\nInterviewee: But not necessarily to that extent where its always been that severe, like the actual clutter.\\nThe collecting [inaudible 00:53:41], you know, and the-- Some clutter that’s contained by parents and things like that, and some of the behaviors are present when they’re young; but they’re not necessarily so problematic in other people’s eyes that they’re going to be coming in for treatment or going to be bugged about how bad it is.',\n",
       " '004_054.txt': 'Interviewer: NAME [27:58] do you want to take over with the next section?\\nInterviewer: Yeah so, it kind of leads us into the next section of the interview, which is talking about the DSM 5 criteria for hoarding disorder.\\nWe know that you had a hand in kind of crafting those criteria; and so are there particular elements of the criteria that you regard as difficult to apply, kind of similar to that distinction that we were talking about where the clutter invades certain areas of the home or certain living space.\\nSo are there elements that you regard as difficult to apply or that you see different clinicians may apply differently?\\nInterviewee: Yeah…I think, I think that one is certainly one that’s a little difficult to apply because you got to make a judgement about interference and distress and if there’s no clutter or little clutter in the living areas of the home.\\nDoes that rule a person out for the diagnosis, and I think that is a bit problematic.\\nI do, I do know, thinking more about that question, I do have one case in particular where there’s relatively little clutter but the scoop velocity about the disposition of possessions is so severe that the person is nearly incapacitated.\\nSo that’s a difficult piece I think of the diagnostic criteria.\\nThe other part that I think is a little bit misunderstood and you probably create some difficulty in making diagnosis, has to do with the specifier of acquisition, excessive acquisition.\\nBased on our research, we find that well over 90% of people have excessive acquisition, but it’s difficult sometimes to assess it because people often either have a hard time recognizing when they’re acquisition is excessive or they answer the question based on the fact that they have attempted to control and are somewhat successful controlling the acquisition by avoiding triggers to acquiring.\\nAnd the difficulty with that is that those triggers can be avoided very successfully over a long period of time.\\nSo someone can gain some short-term control over the acquisition by avoidance but in the long-run it’s still a problem because they can’t keep up that avoidance for very long.\\nInterviewer: Ok.\\nOk. So now we want to ask you some specific questions about the way you think about the DSM 5 criteria, and we both know that you probably know them much better than we do, but we just want to read you a phrase from the criteria and then get to know a little more of your thought process as you apply it to patients.\\nSo…\\nInterviewee: Yeah.',\n",
       " '006_091.txt': 'Interviewer: Right, right, right.\\nOk, so now we’re going to get into some questions that are more focused on your kind of knowledge based about hoarding disorder.\\nSo, if we were to talk really broadly, what, and you kind of started to do this with the list already, but just to talk in a more freeform way.\\nFor you, what are the most salient features of hoarding disorder.\\nParticularly focusing on the difference between maybe what would be considered normal saving behavior or collecting and what constitutes hoarding disorder.\\nInterviewee: Ok.\\nUm, I guess a salient feature is really that there is a remarkable breadth in the symptom patterns and the rationale for saving.\\nWhich leads me to think that that much variability in the patient population, one starts to try figure out whether there is a something more basic going on that can manifest in a wide variety of ways that the source of the problem is far more fundamental.\\nAnd I think that there are probably two places to look for that.\\nOne is in the animal literature on hoarding because there is an animal literature and that, uh, those researchers can actually take the brains apart of the animals and look at what’s going on, uh, and try to figure out the extent to which the human brain has elements that are related to whatever drives the hoarding.\\nThis is probably brain stem level problem, not hyper-cognitive functioning.\\nInterviewer: Hmm\\nInterviewee: Um, and so you think about birds that nest, squirrels that, uh, they’re scatter hoarders and larder hoarders.\\nI find that a really interesting thing, and if I were to go back and start over in my, you know, early twenties, I might well go down that path.\\nUm, the other aspect of hoarding that catches my attention is there, uh, is an awful lot of emotion that people attach, emotion and identity meaning if you will, that people attach to objects that seems to distinguish people who hoard from people who treat objects in a more ordinary fashion.\\nWe’re all capable of being attached to objects so that’s not the issue.\\nUm, it’s the degree of attachment and the kinds of things that people attach the emotions to if you will.\\nSo, sometimes they’ll say stuff that the rest of us just look at and go “what in the world?” [laugh]',\n",

       " '001_006.txt': 'Interviewer: So perhaps the reason we could speculate--and cut me off if you think that this is wrong--but we could speculate that maybe part of the reason that the rate of recidivism tends to be so high with animal hoarding and insight tends to be so low, while it is in object hoarding I think it\\'s uniquely low in animal hoarding, could perhaps be because it requires so much more investment in terms of keeping the animals, so much more investment in the beliefs about the animals and also the animals kind of give back more than objects.\\nInterviewee: Yeah the animals give back more and in terms of the emotional investment, again I wasn\\'t necessarily trained or all that familiar with self-psychology, I\\'ve talked to a number of people that that\\'s their main focus, but I certainly see it as--and when we teach responders in how to deal with animal hoarders, we have to respect the fact that this is the core of their being.\\nThis is how they define themselves, they spend all of their time, most of their money, and all of their psychological investment in their own self-worth and their own image of themselves in their perception that they are helping animals, even if it\\'s a delusion that they are helping animals.\\nSo that\\'s the thing that makes it so potent, if they have everything invested in this relationship and if you take their animals away from them I think it\\'s worse than going into an object hoarder\\'s home and cleaning it up.\\nThat\\'s obviously still going to be disturbing to them, but for a lot of the animals, you take all their animals away and you\\'re almost literally ripping their heart out and that becomes a very hot topic that we still debate among people responding to animal hoarding situations, is it\\'s very common in animal cruelty cases that if there is a conviction or proof of animal cruelty, you issue a no-contact order, you can\\'t have any more animals, and we debated back and forth whether that is necessary in responding to hoarding situations.\\nDo you let them keep some?\\nHow many?\\nAnd so on.\\nAs with alcohol treatment, you have those that basically say, \"You can\\'t be a social drinker if you\\'re an alcoholic, you have to go to complete abstinence\" versus those who say \"you can learn to be a social drinker.\"\\nMy own view, what I personally recommend and seems to work is for a variety of reasons I like to recommend that convicted animal hoarders be allowed to keep a small number of animals, usually no more than five, probably maybe three for a couple of reasons.\\nNumber one, judges don\\'t like taking people\\'s stuff away from them, so they are very sympathetic and I\\'ve been lectured by judges for being too mean to sweet old ladies if we take their animals away or any of their animals away.\\nSo that makes the court proceed a little easier, it also seems to reduce the stresses of separation anxiety pulling animals away, but also tactically it now gives us reason to require random access to their environment.\\nSo, you have to agree as part of your condition to probation to unannounced reasonable home visits to make sure you only have those three dogs.\\nAnd basically if whoever is monitoring the situation comes back and sees that you now have seven dogs, that\\'s contempt of court, you could go to jail.\\nSo, my own practical tactical belief is it is appropriate to allow keeping some stuff, just like you wouldn\\'t send an object hoarder into an empty home.',\n",

       " '001_005.txt': 'Interviewer: So they kind of personify or over-empathize with objects.\\nInterviewee: Right, whereas actually letting an animal go is actually killing it or potentially killing it, the greatest anxiety a lot of the animal hoarders have is their animals will be taken away and euthanized, and the reality is it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophesy because the animals deteriorate.\\nWe\\'re pretty good at bringing hoarder dogs back to reasonable health, we\\'re not very good at rescuing hoarded cats because of high instances of colony blind diseases and they\\'re just generally more fragile and don\\'t do nearly as well in hoarding situations, the mortality rates tend to be higher.\\nSo first of all, whereas your collection of coasters isn\\'t going to reciprocate your presumed love and affection, but the dog does, and so because animals obviously even when kept under very poor conditions will still display affection to their inadequate care giver, that reinforces their notion of \"I must be a good person because this dog loves me.\"\\nAnd I have lots of videos of hoarders picking up the dogs and the dogs lick their face, \"so how can you say I\\'m a bad owner?\\nMy dog loves me.\"\\nSo that\\'s something you never get in pure object hoarding.\\nThe objects may bring them joy but a hoarded animal gives what looks like love, so that\\'s a major difference.\\nInterviewer: It does sound like you see them as different kinds of the same thing, or at least of existing on a spectrum.\\nInterviewee: Right, right, the depth of potential attachment to an animal is obviously much stronger, and then in terms of being the public health aspect as I said, you know, animals pee and poor and reproduce and die, which your toasters don\\'t.',\n",
       " '004_057.txt': 'Interviewer: That is really interesting.\\nIt’s interesting partially because in a lot of our past interviews, people have kind of written that off or said that this is not at all related to hoarding.\\nSo it’s interesting, and I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you see that in your patients or how, if you have examples of the way that people experience this differently.\\nInterviewee: Yeah.\\nI think when you ask people especially about what, in what environment do they feel comfortable, you get a variety of responses.\\nNow many people with hoarding disorder will say they’re uncomfortable at home with the clutter but, yet, many people will say I just feel comfortable around my stuff.\\nAnd I had one client at one point tell me, uh, I came to her house and she said “I had such a tough week and I just want to come home and gather my treasures around me,” and so this sense of comfort and safety being surrounded by one’s possessions, I think, reflects a little bit of this tendency, potentially, this tendency to want to feel cave-like.\\nYou see this in animals.\\nSome animals are cave-like – a dog, for instance, like to be in a kennel because they feel safe there.\\nYou see this also sometimes in autism where there’s sort of these comfort devices where people get in, they’re sort of clamped into these devices.\\nSomething similar to that I think may go on in hoarding disorder.\\nAgain, now, that’s speculative, and what I would be interested in is somebody actually doing that research.\\nInterviewer: Mmhmm.\\nThank you.\\nInterviewer: The last question that we wanted to ask related to the DSM 5 criteria was so the line goes “this difficulty is due to a perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them.”\\nWell how do you determine how much distress is normal or abnormal and how does that relate to potential insight issues when a patient denies having a problem and making that determination of distress?\\nInterviewee: Yeah.\\nThe distress I think is related not so much to the distress someone would say when they have this disorder, but the distress if they are faced with the prospect of getting rid of something.\\nSo that even though someone with respect to insight, someone may say “I don’t have a problem and I’m not distressed by all this stuff,” but they would experience significant distress if they tried to throw something out.\\nAnd so that’s the part of this question about insight and someone who denies that they have a problem.\\nUh, so…remind me again of the first part of that question; I answered the second part.\\nInterviewer: Yeah.\\nJust making the determination in how much distress is normal or abnormal.\\nInterviewee: Oh yeah, okay.\\nSo that’s a clinical judgement, I think.\\nBut it’s a judgement that’s hard to make without discussing with the person or maybe doing experiments trying to see how difficult it is to throw something away.\\nAnd so, again, it comes down to clinical judgement about how, um, how much distress warrants a diagnosis.',\n",
       " '002_024.txt': 'Interviewer: Right, kind of to take that one step further, how would you use this criteria in like an adolescent or a child who\\'s space is being actively managed and controlled by somebody else?\\nInterviewee: Yeah, I find that really tricky and, to be fair, I don\\'t actually assess or diagnose many kids with hoarding, but it is something that encouraged me and it has happened more with our Uni students, which is something that I do deal with regularly, is how do you figure out what would happen if the external constraints were removed?\\nAnd again, that\\'s where I go a bit with the distress criterion, because I think if it\\'s because of the parents being or the roommates being contained to one area, but the person is still struggling on a daily basis with their buying things that they don\\'t need or that they\\'re feeling upset about how much of their personal space has been taken over, or getting into fights.\\nA lot of it is conflict because maybe their mom or dad is saying, \"You need to throw away a couple of these books, you now have 400, and they\\'re crying saying, \"No, I can\\'t\" I think at that point, I would probably say it\\'s a problem, it\\'s a disorder because it\\'s causing so much distress and conflict and yes it isn\\'t causing interference because it\\'s being contained by those external pressures, but that doesn\\'t mean that it isn\\'t a problem and it wouldn\\'t be a really important thing to intervene now.',\n",

And can you think of a specific case or maybe a couple cases that were challenging to diagnose, either clinically or in research, because the individuals were on the border between pathological and nonpathological behavior, maybe subclinical?\\nAnd how you went about making that distinction?\\nInterviewee: Huh… I can’t think of many cases where it was difficult to diagnose because of- there was subclinical.\\nUsually it’s more difficult to diagnose because the person with hoarding is very much trying to keep it a secret or very much minimize the problem, but we would use the very typical standard kind of clinical definition of hoarding; if they have so much stuff that they cant use areas of their home for their intended function or they are tending to accumulate stuff that the rest of us might think of as junk or excessive, we do put a little bit more emphasis I think-- at UNIVERSITY [00:22:34] we put a bit more emphasis on executive functioning deficits too- that that’s a huge part of hoarding disorder that isn’t necessarily in the clinical criteria.\\nInterviewer: How did that manifest in the patients that you’ll see with deficits?\\nInterviewee: Very disorganized, unable to make decisions, unable to prioritize, difficulty initiating a task, difficulty completing tasks-- Even the most mundane, banal, simple tasks, they typically struggle with.\\nInterviewer: Do you feel like it’s sometimes difficult to make a clinical diagnosis of hoarding disorder in terms of other, either concomitant mental health problems that the person might have or because they might look similar to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and other mental health disorders?\\nInterviewee: No, I mean, I’m kind of used to doing pretty thorough and pretty extensive evaluations.\\nSo, we would do a thorough evaluation for OCD and we’d do a thorough evaluation for hoarding disorder.\\nIf we suspect hoarding disorder, we always ask for photographs of the home- they bring in photographs of their home; we usually go down and look at their car.\\nNo, I think we can usually-- I don’t think we’ve had much, kind of a quizzical diagnosis with hoarding disorder.\\nBut maybe we deal with a specific range of hoarding disorders, so we do deal with the kind of mild to moderate to moderate to severe range.\\nWe don’t really deal with extreme severe hoarding disorder, not the kind of stuff that you see on the shows all the time- sometimes but not very often.\\nInterviewer: Yeah.\\nUhm so kind of to continue along these lines, we want to think through the DSM5 criteria with you; just in terms of seeing how its applied, seeing how the individual, kind of, criteria come into play in making a diagnosis.\\nSo, for the next portion of the interview, I’d like to just read you the criteria and then get your- kind of get your feedback on how you think about them and how you’ve used them.\\nAnd you’ve used these criteria with the intent of diagnosing an individual with hoarding disorder, correct?\\nInterviewee: Right.',\n",

Well, the other thing that’s important there related to that, not so much that it’s difficult, but... is the fact that the other pieces of this puzzle point to the possibility that what we’re looking at here is a form of giftedness.\\nAnd that giftedness has to do with, number one, the ability to see the beauty in the physical world and appreciate the beauty in the physical world.\\nLots of collecting behaviors are associated with aesthetically pleasing objects and not wanting to waste that aesthetic in that object.\\nAnd so, one of the most frequent things people collect are things that are designed for some kind of arts and crafts project.\\nAnd the difficulty is people see the potential for the aesthetic value of an object and they collect it with the intention of producing something, some kind of work of art or craft of some kind.\\nBut they don’t have the organizational skills to really get that done, and so in some ways it’s an aesthetic gone awry.\\nAnd the other piece of the giftedness is this ability to make associations with objects.\\nSo, if I see a bottle cap without a bottle my only association is trash and how do I get rid of it, but people with hoarding problems will see the shape and the color and the texture and think about things they could do to bring out those colors and make that even more aesthetically pleasing.\\nSo, it’s almost as though… one of the people in our book Stuff described his brain as a tree with too many branches that every thought leads somewhere and leads him down a different path and there are so many branches that he gets lost.\\nAnd so, it’s a combination of maybe an intense form of intelligence together with sort of an aesthetic giftedness that can’t be controlled.\\nIt can’t be corralled somehow to make it workable.\\nInterviewer 2: Wow.\\nInterviewee: I’m not sure that that answered your question, but [INAUDIBLE 35:13]\\nInterviewer 1: No, I think it was definitely one of the more interesting concepts that you mentioned in your book, Stuff.\\nBoth [NAME 35:20] and I have read it and I think for me that was one of the most interesting things about it, because in the literature it’s not really discussed, the positive aspects of this behavior or this illness.\\nInterviewee: Yeah, yeah.\\nI think here is a place to begin talking about this that would encourage people with this problem to come forward, because one of the things they describe is this feeling of being disrespected.\\nAnd I think that has a lot to do with not coming forward to try to work on this problem or admit this problem.\\nBut if we respect them for what they are good at, then they are likely to be able to come forward a little more readily to say, “Well, what are the downsides of this?” And so, I think that may be a place, that may be a hook to get at this issue of why people may be reluctant to come in for treatment, especially before they get to be 50 or 60 years old, which is when we, most of the time, see people coming in after decades of doing this.',\n",

       " '001_000.txt': \"Interview 001\\nInterviewer: So, one thing that I ask clinical experts about object hoarding, which I wonder since you're somebody who knows a lot about both disorders, so when we talk about insight there's a lot of different constructs of insight that we can talk about.\\nRandy Frost had a paper where he broke it down into four, and the four are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness or that something is wrong, overvalued ideation; so, persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items for object hoarders or animals, and indifference.\\nAnd one of the things that I wonder about is is it a delusional disorder, like--\\nInterviewee: It's very interesting you bring that up because I was just this morning at a meeting at the association of prosecuting attorneys working with a judge who I've worked with on a number of hoarding cases, and she just had a case of a client who was charged with animal hoarding, I forget all the details but I believe it was quite a few dogs--more than 30--but he was found not competent based on a delusion.\\nIt was argued, and we've never had this before in an animal hoarding case, but because he was in such denial.\\nHe otherwise was aware of the proceedings, aware of the charges against him, normally might have been considered competent to participate in his own defense, but because he could not acknowledge that the animals in his care were suffering or were dying, the court considered him to be delusional, that he's otherwise functioning at a very high level but his total failure to recognize the impact of his behavior on the animals was in the court's view indicative of delusional functioning, and basically he was found not competent to stand trial and actually has been admitted to a mental health facility at least temporarily.\\nSo, we had a lot of discussion for probably about half an hour with a bunch of prosecutors because this was a first in terms of my dealing with hoarding situations where not only was it recognized as delusional thinking, but so delusional that an otherwise high-functioning person interfered with his ability to assist in his own defense.\",\n",

So if they’ve been in their environment, they’re more likely to understand that its biological, but if not they may not make that connection?\\nInterviewee: Yeah.\\nI mean, if they don’t have any family members, uhm then the genetics-- The biological component may be harder for them to really have that insight over.\\nThey may recognize that, at least that they struggle emotionally with feeling negative emotions, and that may be a reason why they have the problem like in that-- That that being more like a general problem than necessarily a hoarding-specific one, with the difficulty with negative emotions.\\nInterviewer: Ok so if it wasn’t a biological cause, they might have more of a psychological reason and understanding of their problem.\\nInterviewee: Right.\\nInterviewer: Uh the next question that we wanted to ask you how patients might respond is How convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding them?\\nInterviewee: Uhm, I don’t feel like there’s been a lot of people who have really felt like something horrible would happen besides-- I would say the horrible thing would be that they would feel unhappy, that they would feel uncomfortable.\\nUhm more so than some other catastrophic outcome would come up from it.',\n",

       " '001_013.txt': \"Interviewer: So the same thing with your Lhasa Apso example is, if you have enough money you can get as many dogs as you want.\\nSo that for me raises the question of you know, is this a disorder only a disorder when it starts to interfere with the person's life?\\nInterviewee: Exactly--well, and that's practically if we get back to my original statement is where this becomes recognized is if it is interfering with your activities of daily living.\\nSo, I have a cousin who's got a lot of stuff, but it doesn't quite block his door.\\nNow, if I visit him and I want to sleep on his fold-out couch, he has to spend quite a bit of time taking all the crap off his couch [laughs] so I can sleep, but his bed is clean.\\nNow he's got stacks of magazines around his bed, but he can sleep.\\nSo technically he doesn't quite fit, he clearly has hoarder tendencies, but he wouldn't necessarily be on the clinical scales of the photos of stuff, he wouldn't quite qualify.\\nI still think the lady with the 109 well-cared for Lhasa Apsos is a hoarder, but it's not a hoarding case.\\nInterviewer: So then that's the question, is a disorder a thought or is a disorder a behavior?\\nInterviewee: I think...well it's a disorder of thought that often intrudes upon a behavior, although there can be factors that minimize the impact of the behavior or exacerbate the behavior.\\nGetting back to the whole notion of numbers, that's one of the issues I have is we have a couple of hoarding laws, either at the local level or the state level that define--I think originally the Hawaii law basically said that, you know, having more than twenty five animals then you--and of course the hoarding of animals research consortium agrees that you don't define hoarding disorder based on the number of animals.\\nIt is based I think on the relationship and on the conditions, but that's one of the complicated things is as a legal criminal issue, as an animal protective issue you might have four poorly cared for animals but you don't recognize their problems.\\nAnd so at that level, your four animals might be hoarding, you might just not have the resources or the energy to go out and get more animals, and likewise you might have 20 animals and you invest all your time and money and they're well cared-for, and further complications socially--we've had this happen a few times--is you'll have someone like the woman who lives with the 109 Lhasa Apsos and everything's fine, and then she dies and who wants 109 Lhasa Apsos?\\nThen it becomes a problem of the state to deal with.\\nSo it becomes a problem, it's not an animal cruelty problem but it still is a problem because it still was a disorder of sorts.\\nBut I do see it is an internal disorder that reveals itself in a behavior, which may or may not negatively impact the animals depending on a lot of other conditions.\\nInterviewer: Mhhm, mhmm.\\nWell I really appreciate your time today so just to wrap up, that was all the questions.\"}"
