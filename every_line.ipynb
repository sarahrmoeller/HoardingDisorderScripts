    "To start, given our goal to identify HD via linguistic indicators— those being truncated clauses—in their speech.\n",
    "To this end, we had annotators manually look for truncated clauses in interview transcripts (those with and without HD patients as interviewees).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, annotators did not work directly with transcripts: recall that we broke all of our transcripts up into pieces we call *documents*.\n",
    "For instance, transcript `001` was broken into documents `001_000.txt`, `001_001.txt`, all the way to `001_014.txt`.\n",
    "Annotators worked directly with the documents, finding and labeling truncated clauses there.\n",

    "As another thing, annotators could only access documents from one project at a time.\n",
    "A *project* was our more or less arbitrary designation for a collection of documents.\n",
    "The first project annotators were shown was `HD_set1_1-7`, which you can see as a directory in `./data/json/`, and all other projects were revealed one-by-one slowly over the course of the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters.\n",
    "This fact is more or less trivial for the paper, but is important to acknowledge when working with the data through code. \n",
