I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years.

And we also collect data, so there's data about the cases, but it's quite impoverished because there's no person attached to it. The other line of my research has to do with psychological functioning in hoarding, and there we actually have people who identify as having problems with hoarding come into our research lab and we give them a diagnostic interview and a bunch of testing. I directly listen to the diagnostic interviews, so I hear--I don't conduct them but I supervise them, so I hear quite a lot of stories from these recordings.

So, I think there's a lack of looking at the [INAUDIBLE 17:22] spaces with the diagnosis. So, I think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. And you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. I also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. Like in the area where I live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience.

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem.

So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. Sorry I'm trying to think now what your question was.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. I don't have a clear answer, I guess. It does come down to like a [INAUDIBLE 34:35] judgment on my part sometimes about whether it's getting in the way of their ability to function and their intended use. You're right, there can be gray zones.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yes, I think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis I actually did a memory [INAUDIBLE 47:57] and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yes, so you will see certainly when you come into some of these places and again there’s a range of things, so sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes what you see is tons and tons of old pet food, bags of dog food, bags of cat food, empty cans of cat food, empty cans of dog food, you know litter bags, etc. So some of it is the (INAUDIBLE 37:08) of having animals and I don’t know that they’re hoarding that, they just don’t throw it away and that’s just how their lives are organized.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yes, yeah that also is something...like I have clients who will only hoard brand-new item, like electronics, but they have the same feelings towards these objects even though they haven't used them, they have no immediate use for it, it's cluttering up you know. They can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so I think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. So, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. I think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working [INAUDIBLE 21:25] what they think is valuable or not.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: You know because it--well, I come across people who are very poor and they\\'re saving things to sell and they\\'re not saving the same kinds of things. And actually they actually do sell them, unlike someone with hoarding who might say, \"oh I intend to sell them\" but nothing ever proceeds. And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I\\'ve seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn\\'t hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row. So it doesn\\'t look like intentionally saved containers, like somebody might wash out their containers and might have 150 of them. But they\\'re not just discarded with the food still in them right by the bed.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yup and that was a big debate and that’s where there were (INAUDIBLE, 47:10) and I disagreed because they were kind of writing the criteria and I think even one of their own rating scales, hoarding rating scales, that kind of implies that everybody with hoarding disorder has poor insight and doesn’t want to discard.',\n",

So, the first thing that comes to mind, which has been a longstanding conversation, is the distress or impairment in functioning criteria, so that \"or\" is an interesting one there. And of course reflects the egosyntonic vs egodystonic nature of hoarding and all of the controversy that kind of comes up around that, and I think in some ways we put that discussion to bed, but in other ways I think it\\'s really still quite a central question. Not so much is a disorder a disorder if it is egosyntonic, but what does it mean when it is egosyntonic in terms of things like insight and motivation for treatment? So that\\'s one piece, I think another piece that\\'s really interesting to me, and has been since the time of sort of looking at that criteria, is acquisition as a specifier and I\\'m thinking more broadly about the relationship to compulsive buying sort of the works that [NAME 30:47] is doing and the models of compulsive buying and how we understand. Certainly buying is only one form of acquisition, but what the interrelationship is between those two things, especially given the impulse-control problem that is inherent in acquisition that is different in other elements of hoarding behavior. We don\\'t see quite that same impulse-control problem, or at least manifesting in the same way. And then the third thing that I would say is this differential piece between, that the hoarding is better accounted for by other medical or mental health, you know physical or mental health problems and I think, you know, dementia is a whole place, brain injury is a whole place where actually doing the differential diagnosis to understand what the driver is is really complicated, and I don\\'t think the structured energy for hoarding disorder as it currently stands or any of our other assessments, they weren\\'t developed to help us make those differentials.

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

SO, it kind of depends on how they come to me. And I often find clients who have a lot of stuff and are having difficulty, they have some insight. Like, a lot of times I know research says that they don't, but I find that they do understand that their living spaces do not fit other living spaces.

       "  \"Interviewee: My professional, I actually don't have an undergraduate degree, and my professional background initially was doing HIV/AIDS work in the mid 90's in North Carolina, and then moving to Boston and doing housing work as a community organizer around various housing issues. And then I started doing some work in our code department here at [INSTITUTION 7:09] and that's how we've sort of taken hoarding and I've decided there's gotta be a better way to address the issue and that's when we got some training through [INSTITUTION 7:17] and [INSTITUTION 7:18].\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: So we don't do diagnosis. We're less worried about the mental health diagnosis, our goal is to provide case management intervention so that people aren't losing their homes. And so, if you think about treatment more broadly and less kind of clinically, you know I guess you could make an argument that that what we're doing, that our focus is not on the mental health side, it's on the social service intervention side. In addition to that, we've partnered with [INSTITUTION 8:03] to do some research because we have a very large data base of information that we've collected over the years, to better understand the problem of hoarding as we see it in the community so that we can have a better response in terms of housing stability and eviction prevention.\",\n",

So we partnered with [INSTITUTION 6:26] and developed an evidence-based case management program for hoarding intervention to reduce the risk of housing loss due to hoarding behavior.',\n",

There\\'s not a lot of conversation about this, so anytime you\\'d like feel free to reach out.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

I mean there's some cases where someone maybe wasn't struggling with those symptoms at all and then they're 35 or 40 and then something happened, like a trauma might happen or some sort of stressful life event, and then they develop difficulties with the acquisition and discarding and the disorder comes from that. I think that happens less than what I know about the research, however it does happen. And so that is interesting how for some people it starts kind of insidiously at a young age and then just kind of progressively becomes exasperated, but for others it might not even be there until later in life and maybe a hypothesis is maybe some sort of event, stressor, trauma basically triggers a disorder for some personal reason.

So, they may look at like a newspaper from 10 years ago the same as they would a brand new book. So, they don\\'t know what to discard, they have no starting point so when they start to think about discarding you can tell by body language that they\\'re having difficulty even deciding what item to pick up and then getting distressed when thinking about what to do with it. So, it\\'s not just about like, \"I\\'m gonna get rid of...in this table I\\'m gonna pick up all the garbage and throw the garbage away,\" but what is garbage and what isn\\'t garbage.

I think that's at the heart of it and I think the DSM does outline that. I think the one criteria I might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. I think that when we think about the internet and I already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? It might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the DSM doesn't really talk about. If an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the DSM doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, I mean I'm not sure what you would diagnose.

I have individuals with fears of something incriminating being on any paper material, and so they have to check it, or being worried about throwing out something valuable getting mixed in with the items they want to discard, so the checking rituals become prohibitory difficult. You know, somebody with obsessions around personal information and identity theft, who looks to all intensive purposes superficially like a hoarder because he accumulates everything that comes in the door, but it's really about his concern around identity theft and his having to check it meticulously to make sure he didn't somehow get a piece of mail mixed up with it or something that has his phone number or credit card number or any other information on it.

So, many people I see will say when they look back absolutely as it's been reported in other studies, you know they identified difficulty with discarding going back to their early adult years or teens or sometimes even late childhood, but the accumulation took time to get out of control and quite often I find hoarders that I see who are usually in their 40s to 60s, although I've seen some younger ones, will often say it got out of control because of environmental changes. Their spouse left them of their relationship ended or their children moved out or their aging parents downsized or died. And as a result they've been presented with even more stuff and it totally overwhelmed their ability and their limited ability to cope with it and to deal. At that point, they now recognize the problem. So, I think there's a bit of an artificiality in our saying it's more prevalent among the elderly, which is simply related to the objective reality, which is that it takes years for the accumulation in many cases to really reach that threshold of intolerance or impairment that's recognized by the individual.\",\n",

I guess the reason that I\\'m asking this is that I read this really interesting article this morning about a couple who their home appeared to be totally hoarded out, they couldn\\'t have people over, it was totally filled to the brim, but then they were found to actually be in the possession of a very valuable art collection, which they donated and was valued at millions of dollars. I mean it made their apartment totally non-functional for a decade, but when somebody actually went through the items, they found that they were excessively, they were actually really valuable works of art. And yes they were impairing the couple\\'s use of the home, but it was appropriate for them to be saved because they were so valuable. Would that count as hoarding disorder? Is there an element of either lack of value in the objects or indiscriminateness in the saving? Does that make sense?',\n",

So this was a young woman, maybe in her 30s, she had moved into her apartment maybe only 8 months earlier, so she hadn't lived there very long. It's a very small apartment, her kitchen and living room were kind of all together like in one area, and her bedroom was a separate room, and the photos of the kitchen itself, like the place where you would prepare food and store things did not look hoarded at all. It looked extremely functional in the kitchen, but once you stepped away from the counters, there were piles of things that were more disorganized, but she described the things as not being hers or being temporarily there. Like for example, there were some closet doors that she said belonged to the landlord. And I have a hard time knowing when somebody says that, that this object is temporarily there it just belongs to someone else, I have a hard time knowing how to evaluate that in the context of hoarding because people tell themselves stories about objects in their homes. About, oh yes this belongs to someone else, and they kind of...the fact that is has sat there for a while and it's actually going to sit there for the next five years is not part of the story that they tell themselves. So, I don't quite know how to evaluate it. The most problematic room was her bedroom, however, where the mattress was on the floor and there was no visible floor space in the entire length of the room and she described this situation as being due to the fact that in the previous apartment, her bed had been a loft and she hadn't yet been able to get a bed up on a loft because it takes 3 people to handle the loft. And that under the bed, once the loft was there, would be perfect storage space for all this stuff that was in her bedroom. The things in her bedroom included bikes and quite a large pile of pillows that was not actually on her bed, and the photos made it clear that she actually sleeps on a tiny part of the bed because the rest of the bed is covered with stuff. And so it, partly because the photo was of a bed on the floor, so like if your bed is up, like my bed is a couple feet above the floor, that means that if my possessions were at the height of the bed, that would be two and a half feet of debris. But her bed was on the floor, so it made it look a little fuller than it was. But it's still true that you couldn't walk in it, and she said she couldn't walk over to the other side of the bedroom, so I have a really hard time trying to sort out, especially because different areas of the home had different functional abilities. Like the bedroom looked pretty not functional, the kitchen looked perfectly functional. So yeah, that was a hard one for me.\",\n",

What tells them they won\\'t remember? Are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember.

I mean, most of our cases are pretty straight-forward in terms of, you know, when people are talking about their stuff or what they worry about if they did get rid of their stuff, that in combination with the sheer volume of possessions that we see. I can't think of a case where we were unclear. Certainly where we do run into issues is, and this is very different from looking at things clinically obviously, but we have folks who have other mental health issues such as schizophrenia or something like that. So sometimes for us, we're addressing the hoarding behaviors because that's what we're there for, but sometimes it's not clear, is the other mental health issue the primary factor, or is it the hoarding? And I think that's where it gets tricky and it's very different than how this would be clinically diagnosed.\",\n",

So then we might work there and then we might work together to try to increase insight by just motivational interviewing type of technique. You know, I would never tell somebody that it\\'s a problem, it\\'s only a problem if it\\'s a problem for that person, so it would just be highlighting some of the discrepancies that the individuals might bring up as related to the individual thinking its not a problem and just be kind of highlighting that it is a problem sometimes and having the person kind of sit with it not being a problem but it is a problem, like what does that mean? You know, and kind of talking to somebody to increase their insight would be something that we would do in therapy. But yeah, I think that on some level, most people that I see have some insight. The person that I worked with who had the least amount of insight, I think the reason the person was in treatment was because of the threat of evictions. Those are the hardest cases, because the person has absolutely no insight into the fact that the behavior is problematic and that there is probably distress and impairment in their life, you know there probably isn\\'t going to be any reason to try to fix or do anything differently.',\n",

Like for example, there were some closet doors that she said belonged to the landlord.

The most problematic room was her bedroom, however, where the mattress was on the floor and there was no visible floor space in the entire length of the room and she described this situation as being due to the fact that in the previous apartment, her bed had been a loft and she hadn't yet been able to get a bed up on a loft because it takes 3 people to handle the loft. And that under the bed, once the loft was there, would be perfect storage space for all this stuff that was in her bedroom. The things in her bedroom included bikes and quite a large pile of pillows that was not actually on her bed, and the photos made it clear that she actually sleeps on a tiny part of the bed because the rest of the bed is covered with stuff. And so it, partly because the photo was of a bed on the floor, so like if your bed is up, like my bed is a couple feet above the floor, that means that if my possessions were at the height of the bed, that would be two and a half feet of debris. But her bed was on the floor, so it made it look a little fuller than it was. But it's still true that you couldn't walk in it, and she said she couldn't walk over to the other side of the bedroom, so I have a really hard time trying to sort out, especially because different areas of the home had different functional abilities. Like the bedroom looked pretty not functional, the kitchen looked perfectly functional. So yeah, that was a hard one for me.\",\n",

But I hear it a lot as just like a reason for keeping something, that \"if I don\\'t have this reminder, this cue, I won\\'t remember.\" And I think I tend to challenge that in therapy, because I tend to ask people to test that out for themselves like are they sure they won\\'t remember? What tells them they won\\'t remember? Are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember. So I might reflect that as well, like it sounds like, and maybe even asking somebody like, \"Have you thought about that memory in the last 10 years even without the cue of the item?\" And I think that can be a way to get at whether or not they\\'re actually [INAUDIBLE 1:06:05] or if they\\'re difficulties with memory.

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem.

So I think it sort of depends on… it can be dependent on the skill of the practitioner or it may also be dependent on the individual child and how difficult it is to them to deal with so. Yeah, but I think understanding that it is not going to solely an unpleasant experience both for the child and the parent. I think it is helpful. Although again, I think there has to be some realistic expectations, and I mean I guess it also depends on the CBT whether how much they are going to have an expectation that the parent is going to be involved. I think often… therapy is relatively limited and you are going to have to have more outside parental involvement. So I think that can be challenging for parents. It can be difficult to them to put their child in that situation. It is unpleasant for them. So um yeah… it goes against sort of your parental instincts. So I think that can be a challenge that kind of needs to be made clear to parents. That sometimes you are going to be asked or told to do things that are not what you would think, you know. Protecting your child is not always… the best way to move forward. I mean I guess the other thing is consistency….

Unless there\\'s like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn\\'t there and it\\'s just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there\\'s a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there\\'s no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there\\'s no approaching it in any way shape or form.

So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",

I think where it can get tricky is that hoarding, or individuals who struggle with hoarding, tend to...or the traits tend to show up when they're relatively young, so like adolescent years. And I think that if someone is struggling early on, and they're not actually acquiring enough or having difficulties discarding enough where it's like resulting in clutter that's actually compromising their space or that's like a hazard, then according to the criteria, then it wouldn't be criteria for diagnosis. So, someone might be struggling with hoarding or acquiring objects excessively and might be struggling with discarding, but if they can still use all the spaces in their home, then that kind of puts you in a tricky spot. Because what if not giving this person the diagnosis means they don't get services; however, they don't meet diagnosis, so you can't give them the diagnosis because they don't have the clutter or the, if their home isn't compromised in that way and their space isn't compromised in that way, then you can't come up with a diagnosis at the level of significance where it would need a diagnosis. So that would be, you know, I actually haven't, the only place I've seen that come up is in our research study, because we're looking at folks who are a little less severe and because we don't, because or IRB, we're not seeing people who are being threatened with eviction or because we're going into the home, there can't be mold, there can't be...you know, clutter can't be stacked super high because of earthquake risk and things like that, and so we're actually seeing folks who do kind of fall in that line of is it actually hoarding disorder? Does this meet criteria? And I think for some folks we've had to say no it doesn't, because their home doesn't, the only thing they're saving is the revised inventory questionnaire, if it doesn't meet the threshold, like if they don't have that perceived need to save to the degree that causes impairment or causes distress, then we wouldn't diagnose. So I think taking a look at things like the savings inventory revised or the clutter image rating scale, having a person do those can help you see what actually, is this actually pathological as well as asking them more subjectively like what their home is like and what's their experience inside their home.\",\n",

I think it's important to know, especially with OCD, to know OCD well and when you're--because of course hoarding, difficulty discarding possessions can definitely be a part of OCD, even now they could still be a part of OCD, even though hoarding disorder has its own separate diagnosis. So, I think being careful and when you're looking at differentiating between OCD and hoarding disorder, for example, making sure that hoarding is the primary issue and is basically what the person is struggling with can help you decide whether or not it's assumed as under OCD, as well as looking at some of these OCD-themed...like I've worked with folks, I worked with an individual who was diagnosed with OCD and not hoarding disorder, although had difficulties discarding, and not so much acquiring, it was more discarding. But that was because she was fearful of making a mistake and throwing something out that was important and that she would need, so we would check it several times and it was kind of consistent with her other checking behaviors, which she was also worried about catastrophe and fires and so she would check her door and check her stove, and so it was really consistent with the OCD presentations.

I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding?

Yeah, but I think understanding that it is not going to solely an unpleasant experience both for the child and the parent. I think it is helpful. Although again, I think there has to be some realistic expectations, and I mean I guess it also depends on the CBT whether how much they are going to have an expectation that the parent is going to be involved.

People are so focused on the clutter, what's secondary to... what's actually hoarding and what is secondary to other mental health or physical health problem. The other thing that comes up is issues around trauma, so how does trauma kind of fit in. So, you know, some of the comorbidity research shows that there's a low rate of PTSD. Folks I've met with will talk about a traumatic event, it doesn't mean that it's PTSD and there's some myths out there that trauma causes hoarding and the research doesn't really support that.

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, so I think that does maybe overlap some. I think maybe the difference in hoarding disorder or anxiety disorder or OCD is that, at least from the folks I\\'ve seen, it\\'s not as fixed I guess. The overvalued ideation is there, but there\\'s like enough flexibility in most people to try things differently. Unless there\\'s like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn\\'t there and it\\'s just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there\\'s a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there\\'s no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there\\'s no approaching it in any way shape or form. Most people I\\'ve worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, \"Oh yeah, I can see that\\'s a strong value, I can see how I really think that I am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however I\\'m also seeing that if I do this this way, I\\'m never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, I\\'m never going to be able to do this if I do it 100% right all the time\" so maybe there\\'s some flexibility that\\'s incorporated, even though I still strongly believe that I want to be an environmentally conscious person and I want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that\\'s where I would see there\\'s like some flexibility and it\\'s not completely like, \"I have to do it this way and we\\'re not doing it any differently\" and I think that might be one piece that might help.',\n",

I mean, that's where I think, because we have the impairment or inability to maintain safety for yourself or others, it's not perfect, and you're absolutely right, I hadn't given that enough thought when you asked about problems with the criteria, but typically in those situations we'll say there's some concern, they deny that it's a problem. I have a lady like that with OCD and hoarding, she's been evicted 5 times, she generally over the years has denied that her hoarding is a big problem it just angers others around her. But objectively, there would certainly be a fire hazard and a times, she'd have vermin, so, right? I think the criteria aren't bad as an effort to try and get at that and give us enough venue.\",\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah I would love to read that, yeah. Okay I do have some thoughts about that. So, I think, I\\'ve thought a lot about overvalued ideation and the lack of an ability to perceive a problem, like just not seeing clutter as an issue or maybe not even being able to see the clutter, really or perceive that the space, to not be able to recognize the illness in that way I think that\\'s kind of what we were talking a little bit about with insight before, that an individual just might not be able to see that there\\'s a problem. And so I think that definitely comes up a lot, I\\'ve seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, I think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, I think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. I think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. I think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, I already kind of mentioned, \"There\\'s a specific way I have to discard of this item and it\\'s so important that I do this in a very specific way and if not I\\'m a bad person,\" for example. And that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn\\'t discard in a specific kind of way, they\\'re a bad person. So there\\'s this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don\\'t want to feel like a bad person. So I think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and I think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and OCD as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like \"My rituals are important, I need to do my checking because if not I might murder somebody and I don\\'t want to be responsible for that.\"',\n",

Or like maybe something would happen, you know, like I\\'ll need this and I\\'ll be in hard times again. And actually one of the, like an interesting case example is, I can\\'t remember his name, I think it was a Chinese artist who\\'s mother struggled with hoarding, one second I\\'m just gonna look up the name of it. Oh, Song Dong, and so she was an artist and he grew up in China and his mother basically there was just like economic difficulties in China as he was--or as she was growing up, and so she learned basically to save and to not waste because of those difficulties, just in case that were to happen again. Like it was just kind of a value that she learned because of what was happening in society and that was a big part of her difficulty. It was rooted in her experience as a child and not having what she needed. I\\'ve heard that form many patients and not everybody for sure, but definitely some and there was this idea that, \"I don\\'t want that to ever happen again or at least I want to do what I can to prevent that from happening if I ever were in a situation where I didn\\'t have what I needed.\" I don\\'t see that that often, but I have seen it a couple of times.',\n",

I mean if you look at the why box on hoarding, I think it's still on there, although I don't know if that will change in the future or if we will continue to keep those items in OCD or look to separating the two more. I think that'll be a question for research and for a future study, like does that make sense and is it counterindicated or does OCD kind of explain a person's difficulties with hoarding, is it necessary to give them another label or not, and I guess what would prompt an individual to do that?

When we think about intended use, I think it probably does kind of come from this, I guess societal, just in general what do we use a kitchen for, what was that designed for, when someone built that home, that apartment, they thought that you would be cooking in it. But, then again, that is not obviously taking the person\\'s view point into consideration or like their own experience and their values and if they don\\'t care about cooking or that\\'s not something they ever want to do, you know, is that compromising the use? I think for the intended use, like the same thing can come up with OCD, for example, like if someone is fearful of starting a fire because of the stove, they might not use their stove or their kitchen for cooking whatsoever. It doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s cluttered, but they\\'re still not using it and so the OCD has compromised the room\\'s use, but then I\\'ve had people say, \"Well I don\\'t care about cooking, it has no value in cooking at all so I don\\'t even want to work on that because that\\'s not a value of mine,\" and so I could see how that could come up. I think with hoarding disorder what we think about is if someone moved or lived with a family member who wasn\\'t struggling with hoarding or you know, or if we were to think about what is the typical use of a kitchen, to cook, or a bedroom to sleep, I think that even if an individual suggests that that\\'s not how they intend to use it, I think the way we\\'ve looked at it is that intended use is more like the blueprint. Like what did the architect intend for this space to be used and how was that planned to be used or maybe even how did they plan to use it originally. Maybe when they first moved into the home they did a little bit of cooking, or maybe they ate at their table but now they\\'re not eating. So, I think I do like to, especially when this is just clinical practice and not a research study, I do like to kind of obviously meet the person where they\\'re at and if they don\\'t care about the kitchen or they don\\'t care about cooking, maybe they care about being able to host people in their living room and have a space for people to sit and enjoy the conversation or something like that. So, kind of looking at what uses or what are they not doing in their home that they would like to do, and then focusing on that, especially when we\\'re looking at just treatment in a community setting and not like placing my own values on somebody. Like, kitchens need to be used for cooking and focusing more on that. But in terms of diagnosis, I know that\\'s what we\\'re talking about, it\\'s an interesting question. There\\'s a little bit of a bias in thinking that others should be using their homes in a specific kind of way.',\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

Sorry, one caveat though I would say is the saving of bizarre items that we see in the smaller percentage of hoarding that overlaps with OCD.

In the absence of saving other objects, I'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. For me, the times that I have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly.

I think that's at the heart of it and I think the DSM does outline that. I think the one criteria I might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. I think that when we think about the internet and I already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? It might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the DSM doesn't really talk about. If an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the DSM doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, I mean I'm not sure what you would diagnose.

Folks I've met with will talk about a traumatic event, it doesn't mean that it's PTSD and there's some myths out there that trauma causes hoarding and the research doesn't really support that.

So either they\\'re objectively worthless and the person thinks they\\'re worth money, or there\\'s things that the person is sentimentally attached to that it just doesn\\'t kind of make sense to be so sentimentally attached to those particular items? I guess the reason that I\\'m asking this is that I read this really interesting article this morning about a couple who their home appeared to be totally hoarded out, they couldn\\'t have people over, it was totally filled to the brim, but then they were found to actually be in the possession of a very valuable art collection, which they donated and was valued at millions of dollars. I mean it made their apartment totally non-functional for a decade, but when somebody actually went through the items, they found that they were excessively, they were actually really valuable works of art. And yes they were impairing the couple\\'s use of the home, but it was appropriate for them to be saved because they were so valuable. Would that count as hoarding disorder?

However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember.

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem.

I think maybe the difference in hoarding disorder or anxiety disorder or OCD is that, at least from the folks I\\'ve seen, it\\'s not as fixed I guess. The overvalued ideation is there, but there\\'s like enough flexibility in most people to try things differently. Unless there\\'s like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn\\'t there and it\\'s just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there\\'s a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there\\'s no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there\\'s no approaching it in any way shape or form. Most people I\\'ve worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, \"Oh yeah, I can see that\\'s a strong value, I can see how I really think that I am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however I\\'m also seeing that if I do this this way, I\\'m never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, I\\'m never going to be able to do this if I do it 100% right all the time\" so maybe there\\'s some flexibility that\\'s incorporated, even though I still strongly believe that I want to be an environmentally conscious person and I want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that\\'s where I would see there\\'s like some flexibility and it\\'s not completely like, \"I have to do it this way and we\\'re not doing it any differently\" and I think that might be one piece that might help.',\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah I would love to read that, yeah. Okay I do have some thoughts about that. So, I think, I\\'ve thought a lot about overvalued ideation and the lack of an ability to perceive a problem, like just not seeing clutter as an issue or maybe not even being able to see the clutter, really or perceive that the space, to not be able to recognize the illness in that way I think that\\'s kind of what we were talking a little bit about with insight before, that an individual just might not be able to see that there\\'s a problem. And so I think that definitely comes up a lot, I\\'ve seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, I think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, I think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. I think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. I think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, I already kind of mentioned, \"There\\'s a specific way I have to discard of this item and it\\'s so important that I do this in a very specific way and if not I\\'m a bad person,\" for example. And that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn\\'t discard in a specific kind of way, they\\'re a bad person. So there\\'s this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don\\'t want to feel like a bad person. So I think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and I think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and OCD as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like \"My rituals are important, I need to do my checking because if not I might murder somebody and I don\\'t want to be responsible for that.\"',\n",

One is certainly about the volume of possessions, but that's only important in the context of the ability to carry out daily life activities. So I think you cross the line when you've got interference in carrying out ADLs and that accompanied by these strong beliefs and emotions certainly sets someone who is collecting or someone who is a bit untidy apart from someone with hoarding behavior.

So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",

I think where it can get tricky is that hoarding, or individuals who struggle with hoarding, tend to...or the traits tend to show up when they're relatively young, so like adolescent years. And I think that if someone is struggling early on, and they're not actually acquiring enough or having difficulties discarding enough where it's like resulting in clutter that's actually compromising their space or that's like a hazard, then according to the criteria, then it wouldn't be criteria for diagnosis. So, someone might be struggling with hoarding or acquiring objects excessively and might be struggling with discarding, but if they can still use all the spaces in their home, then that kind of puts you in a tricky spot. Because what if not giving this person the diagnosis means they don't get services; however, they don't meet diagnosis, so you can't give them the diagnosis because they don't have the clutter or the, if their home isn't compromised in that way and their space isn't compromised in that way, then you can't come up with a diagnosis at the level of significance where it would need a diagnosis. So that would be, you know, I actually haven't, the only place I've seen that come up is in our research study, because we're looking at folks who are a little less severe and because we don't, because or IRB, we're not seeing people who are being threatened with eviction or because we're going into the home, there can't be mold, there can't be...you know, clutter can't be stacked super high because of earthquake risk and things like that, and so we're actually seeing folks who do kind of fall in that line of is it actually hoarding disorder? Does this meet criteria? And I think for some folks we've had to say no it doesn't, because their home doesn't, the only thing they're saving is the revised inventory questionnaire, if it doesn't meet the threshold, like if they don't have that perceived need to save to the degree that causes impairment or causes distress, then we wouldn't diagnose. So I think taking a look at things like the savings inventory revised or the clutter image rating scale, having a person do those can help you see what actually, is this actually pathological as well as asking them more subjectively like what their home is like and what's their experience inside their home.\",\n",

It sounds like particularly you\\'re talking about the part of the DSM-IV that says, \"The difficulty discarding possessions results the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use,\" and it sounds like your problem with this is that people sometimes don\\'t have control over their spaces, and so their active living areas aren\\'t technically compromised and so they don\\'t meet this criteria and so then they don\\'t get the diagnosis, even though they exhibit all of the behaviors and ideation that go along with hoarding disorder.

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that\\'s a really good question. With insight I think how I determine insight is like the ability for an individual to recognize or yeah, to recognize that something is an issue or a problem, ultimately. So, this can come up in OCD a lot as well, you know, or this is actually another example that\\'s related, like if someone is having relationship OCD or like is experiencing obsessions about their relationship, they might not see those thoughts as obsessive necessarily, because they might seem valid or warranted. Like, \"Oh this person\\'s bothering me, maybe I sue this person, that\\'s something that I should actually consider.\" So, in that way a person with OCD might not recognize that that\\'s actually OCD and we need to target that in treatment as OCD, and so if they\\'re not going to conceptualize it as OCD, we can\\'t do exposure therapy and we can\\'t treat it in the way we treat other OCD symptoms. So it would be very similar with hoarding disorder, if someone is not seeing that the clutter is an issue and is not able to have insight into the way that it\\'s impacting them, and I think that\\'s ultimately what I think of insight, I think about there being a disconnect between like the consequences. Like I guess not realizing or understanding the consequences of the behavior, so that an individual doesn\\'t actually see their difficulty discarding as leading to relationship issues or leading to issues with them working or doing their hobbies. Like there\\'s that kind of lack of insight into the ways that the problems are impacting them, is kind of how I conceptualize it. I know that insight, and actually somebody on our team who\\'s a psychiatrist and again I\\'m a psychologist, he approaches insight differently and I missed his talk but he was just talking about the brain structures and the ways that the research on insight in general on different psychiatric disorders and how the brain, you know, what circuits might be related to loss of insight or a lack of insight in different disorders.',\n",

But sometimes I'm called by a community organization and they describe a dwelling to me and I haven't had the opportunity to talk to the person or conduct clinical assessments, I find those nearly impossible because I refuse to sort of say something just based on the volume of possessions alone, but I think the more difficult clinical decisions for me have been differential diagnostic decisions and I can think immediately of one case where there was the saving of rather bizarre items, and I was differentially trying to diagnose whether the hoarding was secondary to OCD or whether hoarding was primary and there were two primary co-occurring conditions. It was very tricky, I think the number of cases where we have hoarding in the context of OCD and kind of bizarre saving are limited. You know, they don't number many overall, so I find those very tricky to figure out what the driver is, what the obsessions and compulsions are. The other situation that I currently am working in and is of great interest to me from a research perspective, but having to do with diagnostics is hoarding in cases of severe substance abuse. So, in downtown east side of Vancouver, in the single room occupancy, SRO housing, there's a very very high drug-use rate, opioids largely and hoarding in SROs is overwhelming, this portion of the city and it's very tricky to figure out if the hoarding is secondary to the substance abuse, if it is a more primal sort of animal kind of instinct hoarding, you know the nesting kind of hoarding that Stephanie Preston has written about, or whether it's primary hoarding. And if it is primary hoarding, is it for, you know, for a means to an end of living because these people are in such obvious poverty. So, those conditions where it's not only a co-occurring other diagnostic problem like substance abuse, but the social elements of life I think really complicate diagnosis sometimes.\",\n",

We will give you a prompt and then we\\'ll ask for you to give us off the top of your head a list that comes to mind.

I have a lady like that with OCD and hoarding, she's been evicted 5 times, she generally over the years has denied that her hoarding is a big problem it just angers others around her.

I don\\'t know whether or not, you know I often find that people are like that or are defensive because of past bad experiences they\\'ve had. When I explore it further with them, they have to become defensive because other people have said things like, \"This is disgusting\" or \"how can you live like this?\" So they immediately become defensive, but if often you have a good relationship with the person, you talk things further, they can get to the place where they understand that it\\'s a problem, but their first reaction is defensiveness and it\\'s usually because something bad has happened.

So, the first thing that comes to mind, which has been a longstanding conversation, is the distress or impairment in functioning criteria, so that \"or\" is an interesting one there. And of course reflects the egosyntonic vs egodystonic nature of hoarding and all of the controversy that kind of comes up around that, and I think in some ways we put that discussion to bed, but in other ways I think it\\'s really still quite a central question. Not so much is a disorder a disorder if it is egosyntonic, but what does it mean when it is egosyntonic in terms of things like insight and motivation for treatment? So that\\'s one piece, I think another piece that\\'s really interesting to me, and has been since the time of sort of looking at that criteria, is acquisition as a specifier and I\\'m thinking more broadly about the relationship to compulsive buying sort of the works that [NAME 30:47] is doing and the models of compulsive buying and how we understand. Certainly buying is only one form of acquisition, but what the interrelationship is between those two things, especially given the impulse-control problem that is inherent in acquisition that is different in other elements of hoarding behavior. We don\\'t see quite that same impulse-control problem, or at least manifesting in the same way. And then the third thing that I would say is this differential piece between, that the hoarding is better accounted for by other medical or mental health, you know physical or mental health problems and I think, you know, dementia is a whole place, brain injury is a whole place where actually doing the differential diagnosis to understand what the driver is is really complicated, and I don\\'t think the structured energy for hoarding disorder as it currently stands or any of our other assessments, they weren\\'t developed to help us make those differentials.

I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember.

And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem. And so I think, unless they actually ask for help or come forwards, figuring out the progression of this is very tricky business.\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah that that really interesting so the way I mean I think that the uh like I I'm not a qualitative researcher so um so that the techniques and methods for that are pretty fuzzy for me but I have a really under deep appreciation for them um in part because I don’t know if you’ve already spoke with NAME (7:12)?\",\n",

The indifference is...I see far less I would say, at least as I understand Randy to have been talking about it, and I think I also would say about the first three that I see them as present at different levels and with fluctuation as I was saying earlier. So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know. So, yeah I think I could probably count on two hands the number of patients out of the hundreds that I've worked with where the indifference was very strong. I think it's a much more limited feature from my perspective.\",\n",

Toothpaste caps are not commonly accepted as a collectible, art is. Even weird little things like things that have ducks on them, are recognized. It might not be something that I would want to collect, but people collect them. And hoarding involves a collection of things that don't, like I could see a guy who collected these age-old vitamin bottles because...I mean they were empty, he had eaten the vitamins out of them, but they don't make them the same way anymore. They've changed the style of bottle for this vitamin, so he saw that as a collection but I didn't see that as a collection. And [INAUDIBLE 47:56] why not [laughs], that's where I kind of in depth thinking well because society doesn't say it's a collection.\",\n",

You know, a lot of my clients don't actually meet clinical diagnosis, or wouldn't meet a clinical diagnosis because they may live in a facility that has certain rules or certain guidelines, or they may live with their family members or have been working on their hoarding disorder for long periods of time, but they still have the emotional attachment to objects and they still have the anxiety and the difficulty discarding and trouble with organization, so they still have all of the trouble that goes along with the hoarding disorder, but their space may not meet the diagnosis. So, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it. So, they may still be suffering from the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but not actually meet a diagnosis. So, I will get clients like that often.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, so one thing I often talk about with my patients is differentiating between the difficulty they have in the way they relate to stuff, and the legacy in the years of accumulation, and I think there's inadequate weight given to that distinction. So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. Sorry I'm trying to think now what your question was.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.',\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yes, so you will see certainly when you come into some of these places and again there’s a range of things, so sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes what you see is tons and tons of old pet food, bags of dog food, bags of cat food, empty cans of cat food, empty cans of dog food, you know litter bags, etc. So some of it is the (INAUDIBLE 37:08) of having animals and I don’t know that they’re hoarding that, they just don’t throw it away and that’s just how their lives are organized.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yes, yeah that also is something...like I have clients who will only hoard brand-new item, like electronics, but they have the same feelings towards these objects even though they haven't used them, they have no immediate use for it, it's cluttering up you know. They can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so I think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. So, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. I think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working [INAUDIBLE 21:25] what they think is valuable or not.\",\n",

And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I\\'ve seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn\\'t hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row.

It just so happened that it was an art collection, and when they died it was an extremely valuable art collection that they had accumulated over the course of like 60 years of living in New York city and it was all donated to the MET and valued at like $6 million, but prior to them dying nobody was able to view the art, nobody was able to enter the apartment, it was basically an unlivable space.

       "  \"Interviewee: Right? He is not distressed by it, he objectively recognizes that he accumulates too much, and he would say that he has trouble parting with the old ones and he sees that it's excessive, the acquiring of them, but it doesn't really distress him in any meaningful way, it doesn't impair him. He has the ability to function beautifully in his house and has people over all the time, his butler helps him keep his clothing collection organized, there's no hardship. From a neurobiological perspective, I think he's somebody who in a research study if our criteria didn't exclude him, would probably show the same neurobiological issues but don't think that clinically he's at threshold, because of his material wealth and ability to live comfortably.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Sure, so I'm a trained psychologist and social worker and I came to my work with hoarding actually through work with OCD first and then began working more with people with hoarding over time. I think based on my earlier experiences, some people found it very frustrating to work with people with hoarding, I more challenging but fascinating as well. So I kind of move in that direction and was much more [INAUDIBLE 19:29] kind of behavioral therapy training or ERP to start with back in the day before [INAUDIBLE 19:39] and Randy Frost developed more specialized treatment and kind of moved more into that model. And then I've kind of expanded into multiple models in terms of thinking about various domains and working in housing and public health and other areas as well. So, have kind of like expanded out in that, but definitely come from a mental health background in terms of training.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: They're not totally different, but there are different things--and there is some literature, you know Randy Frost has written some stuff on the distinction between the two.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Um I mean so the way that we usually first we always ask if they have any difficulties with discarding um objects or belongings and if the person says yes to that we always ask for examples um what are the types of things you have difficulties discarding and um if someone were to say my Faberge eggs or (laughing) I don’t know whatever my you know my eighteen hundreds stamp collection um then we would ask the follow up question are there any other types of objects you have a hard time letting go of um so I thick there is a very obvious aspect of value that has to do with just in general with most people think that that something you should hang on to um and and if not then I kind of seeing how extensive it is like are there multiple objects um I think that’s really kind of the crux its not only that they have a hard time discarding um baggies for or the only have a hard time discarding take out containers like a hoarding patient has difficulties discarding a range of objects and again that threshold for how many of these objects they have is tends to be a lot higher then yes I sometimes save takeout containers as well but I have maybe like two of them versus you know so many that you have this cluttered living space',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Um, for the most part I feel like criteria works pretty well, actually. I\\'ve questioned, in the early days I was strongly influenced by Gail Steketee and Randy Frost, thinking about acquiring as a core feature and wondered if it shouldn\\'t be up there as a diagnostic feature, but over the years I\\'ve seen so many who don\\'t endorse it as an active part, that if it were a requirement for diagnosis, it would have to be an option, right, it would have to be not absolutely required. So, I think that\\'s actually fair, that\\'s been a change in my thinking over the years. I sometimes think the language around the urge to save things is just a little bit, maybe just a little bit awkward potentially, because I think when I meet with individuals, you know it just says difficulty discarding regardless of the actual--the need to save due to distress associated with discarding. I think that\\'s part of it, but for many of them it\\'s also the strong urge to keep things. And sometimes I will meet people who say, \"It\\'s not that I can\\'t discard them, I just feel the need to keep everything cuz I might want it or need it.\" So, sometimes the way that the criteria is phrased sometimes seems like a slightly awkward fit to me for that reason.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Um, you know it would be...I've had similar cases, perhaps even a bit more extreme where there were multiple screens and a person was kind of unable to, they had to constantly kind of monitor things and then back in the day of VHS tapes and those kinds of things, the accumulation of that kind of technology, VCRs and things which generally speaking does take up quite a lot less space. In the absence of saving other objects, I'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. For me, the times that I have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly. One case that I can think of, yeah so I don't think strictly it would been the criteria because it wouldn't meet that interference piece, but if it were in the context of other things, perhaps.\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I suppose I see it more probably than even just space, I think. The sociologist in me thinks a lot about the idea of home and how people make home and how objects serve as one way for people to make home, but that there's a whole body of literature in sociology about being builders and the nesting piece that we talked about within hoarding is not far from this idea of the usefulness of objects for building, this construct in sociology, and sometimes building is related to making home but sometimes people just build for the sake of building. And I don't mean that in quite the literal--so just to state that it's a construct. And so yes, I see it quite broadly and I think that the continuum is a long one and that we don't fully understand all of the elements, all of the variables, if you will. For example, cultural or geographic region variations in how people use space or the idea of building or building homes, I think we haven't begun to tap into understanding those pieces.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that's a really good question. I think that definitely could be possible and I think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that I've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",

You know like, \"I\\'ll read all of these books someday, I might need it sometime, I\\'m afraid I\\'ll forget\" it didn\\'t seem to sound like OCD but there were no physical objects in sight.

So the first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia, which is where you're unable to even perceive your illness or that anything is wrong or causing you distress, the third one is overvalued ideation, and that's kind of believing that your items are more valuable than they truly are, and the last one is indifference. Do any of these, all of these seem like they're relevant for your patients? Is there one that you think is more important or less important?\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewer: So there was this wonderful paper by Randy Frost about the concept of insight, which is really the big one that discusses it and breaks it down and he broke it down into four different constructs that one could talk about when one talks about insight, and I'm gonna read them to you. The first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia or kind of the lack of ability to perceive your illness or that something is wrong and causing you distress or reducing quality of life, the third is overvalued ideation, which is kind of the persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items which could be mild or could be delusional, and then the final one is indifference. And I wonder if you see all of these in your patients, if you see some of them as being more important than others or how you relate what you think of as insight or low insight to these different ideas of defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideation and indifference?\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewer: So, there was this paper published by Randy Frost where he talks about the concept of insight, and he in the paper broke it down into different constructs, and I'd like to read you these constructs and have you think with me through which in your mind are the most important or how you see them related to each other. So the constructs that randy came up with are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness, overvalued ideation, so that would be more of a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items, or indifference. Um, and I'm wondering how you see these fitting together in people's insight. So, these are interesting to me because they are so varied. So, overvalued ideation or anosognosia even, sound almost more like a delusional disorder where you're looking at an item and you have an unreasonable belief that the item is more valuable than it is, or you're looking at your space and you think that your space looks normal, even though is objectively, you know no one with objectivity would see it as normal. Whereas defensiveness is much more based on behavior and indifference also is very behavioral and seems sort of like related to depression and just not caring about space. So, I guess what I'm getting at with this question is how do you think about these and do you see them all as equally relevant or do you feel like some are more central to insight as you understand it in hoarding disorder?\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewer: So, this criteria you're talking about, the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use, I guess I'm wondering...well two things. First of all, you gave the example of a supplemental housing situation where they only have one room, and I'm wondering how you make an assessment of hoarding disorder when people can occupy such different amounts of space. So, if you owned a mansion and were very very rich and could afford kind of infinite storage units, such that your space was never compromised, would you ever have hoarding disorder? Would you ever meet criteria for hoarding disorder? Versus somebody who is living in a one bedroom apartment where the amount of stuff they have, you know, you could have a very normal amount of stuff but if you don't have any space, your space will be congested. So, how do you take that into account and do you take that into account? Would a person who has a mansion ever have hoarding disorder if they couldn't fill up their mansion?\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewer: Sure, and you know, this interview isn't an effort to discredit the criteria, it's just kind of an effort to think through them and to understand kind of how clinicians are applying them. It's interesting for that reason, and it's also interesting because you know different people can have different ideas on a normal spectrum of how much is too much. So, some people really like having clutter around, they feel better in a space that's more full of items than others, and we wouldn't think that that's strange, but it crosses a line with hoarding disorder in terms of safety and sometimes not with distress, sometimes with distress. So, I'm wondering again, like the beautiful example you gave of the man with his bespoke suits, would it be possible to have hoarding disorder with, for example, digital media? So, could somebody hoard emails and books online, and PDFs, and have just hard drives full of material and would that be a hoarder?\",\n",

I sometimes think the language around the urge to save things is just a little bit, maybe just a little bit awkward potentially, because I think when I meet with individuals, you know it just says difficulty discarding regardless of the actual--the need to save due to distress associated with discarding. I think that\\'s part of it, but for many of them it\\'s also the strong urge to keep things. And sometimes I will meet people who say, \"It\\'s not that I can\\'t discard them, I just feel the need to keep everything cuz I might want it or need it.\" So, sometimes the way that the criteria is phrased sometimes seems like a slightly awkward fit to me for that reason.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, definitely, I think you can. However, I think the difference is, like it's interesting that you mentioned cuckoo clocks because I've actually worked with an individual who loved cuckoo clocks and had several cuckoo clocks, but as we were doing our decluttering exercises, she was coming across one she hadn't seen in years and forgot she owned. So I think, you know, she loved cuckoo clocks and she had several, she even had one up on her wall actually; however, we were finding cuckoo clocks that she didn't even remember she had because they were lost in her clutter. And so, ultimately, you know, I think we could say she was collecting, and that was aesthetic, that was purely just loving cuckoo clocks and the way they look. And she loved Germany and she got several from Germany and things like that, so there might be some, maybe this can make it down to that sentimental value, too, so there might be some reasons why this person liked cuckoo clocks, but ultimately, yes I think that an individual can hoard one kind of item or a specific kind of item. However, I don't think it's limited to that. So like, this individual who loved cuckoo clocks also acquired a lot of other things, so it was more than just the cuckoo clocks and I think that's why this individual wasn't able to enjoy the cuckoo clocks in the way that someone who was just collecting them might, because she wasn't able to find them or retrieve them when she wanted to. Or even, you know, eventually folks might forget that they have some of these objects, right. So I think that with collecting, individuals mostly know like what items they have, they can pull them out and look at them.\",\n",

I think that a lot of patients believe that> I don\\'t know, maybe for some it is the case that they do struggle with memory and maybe because of that executive function difficulty or problems, maybe there are some like cognitive developments. But I hear it a lot as just like a reason for keeping something, that \"if I don\\'t have this reminder, this cue, I won\\'t remember.\" And I think I tend to challenge that in therapy, because I tend to ask people to test that out for themselves like are they sure they won\\'t remember? What tells them they won\\'t remember? Are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember. So I might reflect that as well, like it sounds like, and maybe even asking somebody like, \"Have you thought about that memory in the last 10 years even without the cue of the item?\" And I think that can be a way to get at whether or not they\\'re actually [INAUDIBLE 1:06:05] or if they\\'re difficulties with memory.

If that wasn't true, there wouldn't be worry about stigma or inviting people in or fear of negative consequences. So, I think this insight piece is worthy of enormous amounts of research and exploration because it is not, for most people, entirely absent. The insight into the impairment, the functional impairment or the negative consequences for self might be more diminished, but for most people that I've encountered clinically, now hundreds of people with hoarding, this idea that they're not like others seems to be present at lest to some greater or lesser extent. So, that part of insight is a little trickier for me. How do we help people who have some awareness that they're not like others actually use that to either be able to articulate the distress that they feel, or to move them toward being more motivated--intrinsically motivated--for treatment?\",\n",

I think ultimately I would look at if there isn't the distress, the subjective distress, I guess trying to find like is there impairment, is there functional impairment related to that perceived need to save and the difficulty discarding. So, if the person isn't impacted, if it isn't interfering even if the person is saying it's not really stressful or causing distress, but is it interfering to a significant degree and trying to speak or talk to the person about that. Like for example, one of the individuals I worked with who the county was threatening eviction, he didn't see any problem with his difficulty. He didn't experience distress, either related to that perceived need to save or the difficulty discarding. Well he did, but he didn't subjectively identify that as a problem, and so he had decided that there was distress when he was deciding to get rid of things, so he would keep them, and the excessive acquisition brought pleasure for him or it was something that he enjoyed doing, so the only piece that led to the impairment was someone from the outside saying that he had a problem. But they had power so they were the one threatening eviction, and so then even though he didn't have insight into his disorder, he didn't have insight into the difficulty. It actually had caused a lot of problems with his relationships, like he was estranged from his whole family but he didn't have insight that the hoarding was a part of that really, and so really the only area--he did agree with the fact that yeah this is causing distress and I will be impaired if I don't have a home to live in, I won't be able to do anything if I don't have a home, and so at that point, the diagnosis was still warranted because of the situation and because of the distress around that.\",\n",

So, they may look at like a newspaper from 10 years ago the same as they would a brand new book. So, they don\\'t know what to discard, they have no starting point so when they start to think about discarding you can tell by body language that they\\'re having difficulty even deciding what item to pick up and then getting distressed when thinking about what to do with it. So, it\\'s not just about like, \"I\\'m gonna get rid of...in this table I\\'m gonna pick up all the garbage and throw the garbage away,\" but what is garbage and what isn\\'t garbage. So, I think that is a distress because when they try to make a decision, they just kind of shut down and they can\\'t make that decision. So, they have difficulty knowing where to start, and then the anxiety that they get. So, a lot of times they\\'ll do self-talk like, \"well I guess I could get rid of this,\" or \"I could use this for this\" or you know, they can\\'t really make that one decision quickly. They have to kind of go through the motions of what if. They always talk about what ifs, and I know they\\'re starting to get distressed when they\\'re thinking about all the possibilities. When they\\'re trying to make a decision it\\'s, \"what could go wrong.\" They start catastrophizing, you know, \"if I got rid of this item,\" kind of think about the worst possible thing that could happen, instead of just, \"I\\'m getting rid of it and then it\\'s out of my head.\" And then they will start to ruminate on the possibility that they made a mistake if they do make a decision, so that\\'s kind of how I measure distress.

I think, and again I think we haven't scratched the surface here, but I think it ranges from personal values and cultural elements across the cultural and societal levels. So, I sort of see that PCS model. I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding? Would the phenomenon even have roots, because it couldn't manifest in the same ways?

I think ultimately the DSM runs pretty well, you know, that the heart of this diagnosis has to do with that perceived need to save and that difficulty upon attempting to discard, so that distress associated with discarding and that perceived need to save. I think that's at the heart of it and I think the DSM does outline that. I think the one criteria I might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. I think that when we think about the internet and I already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? It might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the DSM doesn't really talk about. If an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the DSM doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, I mean I'm not sure what you would diagnose.

Just to give you a framing of what we\\'re gonna do today, our interview has two sections. The first section uses a technique that\\'s called free listing, and the idea behind free listing is, it\\'s a little bit like a fluency test. We will give you a prompt and then we\\'ll ask for you to give us off the top of your head a list that comes to mind. So an example of a prompt might be, \"Could you please list for me all the animals that you can think of\" and then you would go ahead and say, \"Dog, cat, lion, tiger\" and keep going until you can\\'t think of any more. And the difference between this and a fluency test is that it\\'s not timed at all, and we are most interested in what items you list and what order they\\'re listed in, and we want to get an exhaustive list from you, so feel free to take your time. And the idea again is just to generate a list, so fairly short responses if possible.',\n",

So we have healthy control participants, we have sub-clinical hoarding and hoarding, so I see inside a lot of homes that way [laughs]. And so I've seen quite a lot of small apartments, and people who are not hoarding, they just have fewer things in the smaller apartment. Kind of like a person living in a big home and lots of storage space has a lot of stuff in that storage space, and a person who lives in an apartment without much storage space at all would make different choices and have fewer items.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Kind of those breakthrough moments people talk about one way or the other.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, good question. So, I think the really big difference, there\\'s a couple key differences I think, a lot of people collect and I think...I can\\'t remember what year it was but I don\\'t remember the percentage but there was a study done in the UK and it showed like 25% of the population engaged in collecting. So, obviously collecting is distinct from difficulties that are associated with hoarding disorder. I think one reason is that when someone\\'s collecting, they tend to be able to organize their collection and kind of store their collection away, so if they\\'re collecting stamps or what have you, they\\'re kind of organized and they have a home and then these folks tend to bring up these collections and they tend to show them off with pride, there\\'s joy associated with them like, \"look at these fans\" or maybe find other people who are interested in that particular item and they may show these items with joy and pride; whereas folks who are struggling with hoarding disorder tend to experience a lot of shame. There aren\\'t, the items aren\\'t necessarily organized in that neat, nice structured fashion and they\\'re not necessarily showing others with pride. There\\'s actually a lot of shame and distress associated with the items. I think that\\'s a key difference, and those are the primary differences, now that I\\'m thinking about it actually. Like the way in which they\\'re stored, folks with hoarding disorder don\\'t have these items stored away so they can bring them out and show people, and the feelings associated with it. So, kind of the feeling of pride when someone\\'s showing off their collection, versus somebody who is ashamed and has negative emotion around having all of these items in their home.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that's a really good question. I think that definitely could be possible and I think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that I've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",

Or do you think that the behavior is what's coming first, and the reasons that people give are kind of post-hoc explanations for a compulsive behavior?\",\n",
       "  'Interviewer: Kind of to follow that up, different individuals--so one of the reasons I found your initial response to my question about how you can tell hoarding disorder to be so interesting, is that different people might like to have different amounts of stuff around them. So, I might like to have a totally clear desk, whereas my sister might really prefer a desk that\\'s cluttered and she might say something like, \"well I think better when there are more items around me.\" And I wonder if you ever think of hoarding disorder as being an extension of that sort of concept, or maybe less about the individual items and more about the relationship between a person and objects in space. So, I like to be more enclosed, or they like to have a busier...I think the word they used is chaotic, you know they like to have things that they can look at and see everywhere around them; rather than somebody who prefers simplicity in their space.',\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Well...I mean the, I was part of the clinical trial, I was a study therapist on the [INAUDIBLE 1:08:27] trial, from which the data emerged that people begin saving and [INAUDIBLE 1:08:35]. And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem. And so I think, unless they actually ask for help or come forwards, figuring out the progression of this is very tricky business.\",\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah you know the person who INAUDIBLE (1:30:12)',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I can tell you about a case from last week. So this was a young woman, maybe in her 30s, she had moved into her apartment maybe only 8 months earlier, so she hadn't lived there very long. It's a very small apartment, her kitchen and living room were kind of all together like in one area, and her bedroom was a separate room, and the photos of the kitchen itself, like the place where you would prepare food and store things did not look hoarded at all. It looked extremely functional in the kitchen, but once you stepped away from the counters, there were piles of things that were more disorganized, but she described the things as not being hers or being temporarily there. Like for example, there were some closet doors that she said belonged to the landlord. And I have a hard time knowing when somebody says that, that this object is temporarily there it just belongs to someone else, I have a hard time knowing how to evaluate that in the context of hoarding because people tell themselves stories about objects in their homes. About, oh yes this belongs to someone else, and they kind of...the fact that is has sat there for a while and it's actually going to sit there for the next five years is not part of the story that they tell themselves. So, I don't quite know how to evaluate it. The most problematic room was her bedroom, however, where the mattress was on the floor and there was no visible floor space in the entire length of the room and she described this situation as being due to the fact that in the previous apartment, her bed had been a loft and she hadn't yet been able to get a bed up on a loft because it takes 3 people to handle the loft. And that under the bed, once the loft was there, would be perfect storage space for all this stuff that was in her bedroom. The things in her bedroom included bikes and quite a large pile of pillows that was not actually on her bed, and the photos made it clear that she actually sleeps on a tiny part of the bed because the rest of the bed is covered with stuff. And so it, partly because the photo was of a bed on the floor, so like if your bed is up, like my bed is a couple feet above the floor, that means that if my possessions were at the height of the bed, that would be two and a half feet of debris. But her bed was on the floor, so it made it look a little fuller than it was. But it's still true that you couldn't walk in it, and she said she couldn't walk over to the other side of the bedroom, so I have a really hard time trying to sort out, especially because different areas of the home had different functional abilities. Like the bedroom looked pretty not functional, the kitchen looked perfectly functional. So yeah, that was a hard one for me.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I think for me the first three I would say I see in equal distribution frequently, and sometimes overlapping. The indifference is...I see far less I would say, at least as I understand Randy to have been talking about it, and I think I also would say about the first three that I see them as present at different levels and with fluctuation as I was saying earlier. So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know. So, yeah I think I could probably count on two hands the number of patients out of the hundreds that I've worked with where the indifference was very strong. I think it's a much more limited feature from my perspective.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I think it depends on the person and you know I think it really takes a lot of time to understand somebody. Like why do they feel safe in a place that has a lot of stuff? Like what is it about the stuff and their space that is making them feel comfortable? And I think it's really important for anybody to understand that not everybody lives in the same way, like I wound't necessarily live in a home like my friend who has lots of stuff, but she may be more comfortable in that space than I am. So, I think when I look at it, I look at why they are living in that space and if there's safety lists involved that they're not considering, like I can see a lot from somebody I get a lot of consultations about. You know, this person is hoarding and then I go into their home and they just have a lot of stuff. There's no safety risks, but their family or their mental health worker just views it as being like not good or not a way that they would live. So, you know, in my experience I look at...when I'm looking specifically at space, less at their attachment, I look at the safety risks.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both but I think it's usually, like for my clients I have clients that are 18 to 90-something years old, and I think that all of the older clients can talk about that they did have some of the behaviors and the tendencies until something happened, and I think it's accumulation of the objects or major stressors that have caused backsliding. You know, they often will talk about how they tried to manage it or that they tried to keep things clear and they tried to work on their discarding, and then something else has happened. So I think when they're adults there's also accumulation of stuff, the life events that have happened, they're also accumulating a lot of the times stuff of their children or grandchildren that lived in their home, they're also dealing with major life stressors that may be contributing to the difficulties that they're having. They also have mobility and other health issues that are involved, so they can't do the same things that they used to do like move things around or get rid of things. They may not be driving, but I think that it may not be that the actual hoarding or the actual feelings or attachment has gotten worse with older adults, I think it's accumulation of what's happened in their life. Like the life events and the accumulation of items, because my clients that are 18 can talk about items the same way and have the same feelings as somebody in their 80s. And usually the older adults don't have the outside influence of their parents or spouse or partner, roommates that are stopping them from over cluttering. You know, they're usually living alone or they're in their own space so that they're able to accumulate in a way. They're not having like that outside influence.\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I think that the reason for hoarding is completely different. And I don't work with people with animal hoarding like regularly or anything, but I think that the reason for hoarding is completely different. They don't have difficulty with decision making the same way, they don't have...like they have an emotional attachment, but I think that they might be stemming more from attachment issues rather than emotional attachment to objects or difficulty understanding like useful or non-useful things. So, I think it is more like...it's stemming from like attachment issues. Like people attachment issues.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I think that's a really good thing to be confused about. It's also one of those things where there's this unspoken kind of social norms at play. Toothpaste caps are not commonly accepted as a collectible, art is. Even weird little things like things that have ducks on them, are recognized. It might not be something that I would want to collect, but people collect them. And hoarding involves a collection of things that don't, like I could see a guy who collected these age-old vitamin bottles because...I mean they were empty, he had eaten the vitamins out of them, but they don't make them the same way anymore. They've changed the style of bottle for this vitamin, so he saw that as a collection but I didn't see that as a collection. And [INAUDIBLE 47:56] why not [laughs], that's where I kind of in depth thinking well because society doesn't say it's a collection.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, I think you’re exactly right that the presence of clutter and the severity of clutter is influenced by a whole bunch of things that are completely external to the person’s psychopathology and for that reason (INAUDIBLE, 36:36) sort of hoarding special interest groups at the foundation and our little research conferences.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, I would say [INAUDIBLE 17:15), like there’s some, like, magical case where it has no bearing on their life, and now, I just think it’s like so unlikely, I’ll just sign off.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, and the kind of departures from reality, the main departure from reality I see is one that we all indulge in, and that is thinking that they're going to become a different person in the future. Like not using their own past behavior of a good judge of how they're going to continue behaving in the future.\",\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, exactly. Yeah because people do stop acquiring in some point in life, like you get everything you need so you\\'re not acquiring these things intentionally like just to add to, like \"oh geez I could use a [INAUDIBLE 1:02:36] or whatever\" [laughs].',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, good question. So, I think the really big difference, there\\'s a couple key differences I think, a lot of people collect and I think...I can\\'t remember what year it was but I don\\'t remember the percentage but there was a study done in the UK and it showed like 25% of the population engaged in collecting. So, obviously collecting is distinct from difficulties that are associated with hoarding disorder. I think one reason is that when someone\\'s collecting, they tend to be able to organize their collection and kind of store their collection away, so if they\\'re collecting stamps or what have you, they\\'re kind of organized and they have a home and then these folks tend to bring up these collections and they tend to show them off with pride, there\\'s joy associated with them like, \"look at these fans\" or maybe find other people who are interested in that particular item and they may show these items with joy and pride; whereas folks who are struggling with hoarding disorder tend to experience a lot of shame. There aren\\'t, the items aren\\'t necessarily organized in that neat, nice structured fashion and they\\'re not necessarily showing others with pride. There\\'s actually a lot of shame and distress associated with the items. I think that\\'s a key difference, and those are the primary differences, now that I\\'m thinking about it actually. Like the way in which they\\'re stored, folks with hoarding disorder don\\'t have these items stored away so they can bring them out and show people, and the feelings associated with it. So, kind of the feeling of pride when someone\\'s showing off their collection, versus somebody who is ashamed and has negative emotion around having all of these items in their home.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, it has some consequence or what it is. Like she didn\\'t say, \"Oh I never go to bed after midnight\" when in fact she goes to bed at 2. She would say, \"I go to bed at 2.\" And that\\'s what I call insight.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, okay, so and then there’s some literature and (INAUDIBLE, 15:41) and colleagues on that and the differential.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, regardless of their actual value, I think that they attempt to try to say things that other people would get rid of. But when you use that language to ask inner beauty, many of them would say, \"I don\\'t know what other people look at.\" [laughs] So that\\'s not good language, you can\\'t use that one. But that\\'s the way I see it, is in effort to say do you keep stuff that other people would get rid of? And I see that as thinking and being responsive to your space. Like do you keep stuff that other people would say, \"I\\'d rather have this space than this object in my life.\" And in terms of the paintings, how I would view that would depend on what else is in the home. Like if the paintings were the only thing in the home that was making someone think, \"Oh, this is hoarding\" then I might think it doesn\\'t sound like hoarding to me.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, so I [INAUDIBLE 12:33] mostly because families are involved or because of the space. You know, a lot of my clients don't actually meet clinical diagnosis, or wouldn't meet a clinical diagnosis because they may live in a facility that has certain rules or certain guidelines, or they may live with their family members or have been working on their hoarding disorder for long periods of time, but they still have the emotional attachment to objects and they still have the anxiety and the difficulty discarding and trouble with organization, so they still have all of the trouble that goes along with the hoarding disorder, but their space may not meet the diagnosis. So, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it. So, they may still be suffering from the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but not actually meet a diagnosis. So, I will get clients like that often.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, so one thing I often talk about with my patients is differentiating between the difficulty they have in the way they relate to stuff, and the legacy in the years of accumulation, and I think there's inadequate weight given to that distinction. So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. Sorry I'm trying to think now what your question was.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, that\\'s a really good question. Of course that would be a great research question, I don\\'t--yeah I think that\\'s hard. I think that from what I\\'ve seen, people when they\\'re acquiring or having difficulty discarding, it does seem to really ring true to their values of whatever those things are. So if it\\'s someone who cares about the environment, it does seem like in the moment when we\\'re doing an exposure, that that really is what\\'s happening. That the act of discarding this will make the person feel anxiety and a part of that might also be that there\\'s maybe a biological vulnerability or sensitivity, just like all anxiety disorders, and that learning component. So maybe I\\'m more vulnerable to feeling a need to acquire and also more vulnerable to want to keep things because I feel like I want to remember, maybe I\\'m more of a sentimental person. So there might be some distress associated with thinking about getting rid of something, and then as a solution there might be this avoiding discarding, right. Like, \"Oh I don\\'t want to deal with that\" so maybe it\\'s an anxiety sensitivity thing or an emotional sensitivity thing. Like, I just feel more distressed than the average person when I think about discarding these things, so I avoid doing it. And maybe there might be some post hoc reasoning or rationalizing of it after the fact, so it might be a combination of the two. I think there very well could be, although I think in a way it\\'s almost like the avoidance behavior of discarding leads to all the clutter, it\\'s just kind of a way that people might learn to cope with the distress that\\'s associated with the need to discard, given just the environment. Like if someone had a huge home and all the money in the world, there wouldn\\'t be as much of a need to go through and to discard things, and so that might be a different situation. But the fact is that most people do need to find things and have trouble finding things and so there might be behavioral reasons why people avoid or cope with that that kind of lead in the long term to this trap. You can avoid discarding things for a while, but ultimately if you think of a bathtub that doesn\\'t have a drain, it\\'s just eventually gonna overflow and then that\\'s just going to become even more overwhelming. And so that behavior worked in the short-run, maybe they avoided feeling bad for a while, they avoided that distress and now we\\'re in a situation that\\'s maybe much worse. So in a way it\\'s almost like, the way I look at or conceptualize it, the way I like to conceptualize all maladaptive behavioral responses to an emotional problem is just that it\\'s a solution, for the moment, it\\'s usually a short-term solution that someone comes up with, like it\\'s either from anxiety like you\\'d see some avoidance behavior, you know, \"I\\'m just gonna avoid doing that or going to that place or looking through my items or discarding\" but that only provides short-term relief because at the end of the day, the distress is still there. The person still experiences distress when thinking about discarding, and then they haven\\'t discarded for 20 years and now the problem is just so much worse that the distress is just exacerbated and increased. So that\\'s the way I tend to conceptualize it, is that its their learned behavior based on that biological vulnerability or that biological kind of maybe anxiety sensitivity or emotion sensitivity as it relates to in this case hoarding, or acquisition and discarding.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that's a really good question. I think that definitely could be possible and I think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that I've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that\\'s a really good question. With insight I think how I determine insight is like the ability for an individual to recognize or yeah, to recognize that something is an issue or a problem, ultimately. So, this can come up in OCD a lot as well, you know, or this is actually another example that\\'s related, like if someone is having relationship OCD or like is experiencing obsessions about their relationship, they might not see those thoughts as obsessive necessarily, because they might seem valid or warranted. Like, \"Oh this person\\'s bothering me, maybe I sue this person, that\\'s something that I should actually consider.\" So, in that way a person with OCD might not recognize that that\\'s actually OCD and we need to target that in treatment as OCD, and so if they\\'re not going to conceptualize it as OCD, we can\\'t do exposure therapy and we can\\'t treat it in the way we treat other OCD symptoms. So it would be very similar with hoarding disorder, if someone is not seeing that the clutter is an issue and is not able to have insight into the way that it\\'s impacting them, and I think that\\'s ultimately what I think of insight, I think about there being a disconnect between like the consequences. Like I guess not realizing or understanding the consequences of the behavior, so that an individual doesn\\'t actually see their difficulty discarding as leading to relationship issues or leading to issues with them working or doing their hobbies. Like there\\'s that kind of lack of insight into the ways that the problems are impacting them, is kind of how I conceptualize it. I know that insight, and actually somebody on our team who\\'s a psychiatrist and again I\\'m a psychologist, he approaches insight differently and I missed his talk but he was just talking about the brain structures and the ways that the research on insight in general on different psychiatric disorders and how the brain, you know, what circuits might be related to loss of insight or a lack of insight in different disorders.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think that\\'s a really good question. When we think about intended use, I think it probably does kind of come from this, I guess societal, just in general what do we use a kitchen for, what was that designed for, when someone built that home, that apartment, they thought that you would be cooking in it. But, then again, that is not obviously taking the person\\'s view point into consideration or like their own experience and their values and if they don\\'t care about cooking or that\\'s not something they ever want to do, you know, is that compromising the use? I think for the intended use, like the same thing can come up with OCD, for example, like if someone is fearful of starting a fire because of the stove, they might not use their stove or their kitchen for cooking whatsoever. It doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s cluttered, but they\\'re still not using it and so the OCD has compromised the room\\'s use, but then I\\'ve had people say, \"Well I don\\'t care about cooking, it has no value in cooking at all so I don\\'t even want to work on that because that\\'s not a value of mine,\" and so I could see how that could come up. I think with hoarding disorder what we think about is if someone moved or lived with a family member who wasn\\'t struggling with hoarding or you know, or if we were to think about what is the typical use of a kitchen, to cook, or a bedroom to sleep, I think that even if an individual suggests that that\\'s not how they intend to use it, I think the way we\\'ve looked at it is that intended use is more like the blueprint. Like what did the architect intend for this space to be used and how was that planned to be used or maybe even how did they plan to use it originally. Maybe when they first moved into the home they did a little bit of cooking, or maybe they ate at their table but now they\\'re not eating. So, I think I do like to, especially when this is just clinical practice and not a research study, I do like to kind of obviously meet the person where they\\'re at and if they don\\'t care about the kitchen or they don\\'t care about cooking, maybe they care about being able to host people in their living room and have a space for people to sit and enjoy the conversation or something like that. So, kind of looking at what uses or what are they not doing in their home that they would like to do, and then focusing on that, especially when we\\'re looking at just treatment in a community setting and not like placing my own values on somebody. Like, kitchens need to be used for cooking and focusing more on that. But in terms of diagnosis, I know that\\'s what we\\'re talking about, it\\'s an interesting question. There\\'s a little bit of a bias in thinking that others should be using their homes in a specific kind of way.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, that's a good question, I mean that's pretty hard, that's a hard call to make. I think ultimately I would look at if there isn't the distress, the subjective distress, I guess trying to find like is there impairment, is there functional impairment related to that perceived need to save and the difficulty discarding. So, if the person isn't impacted, if it isn't interfering even if the person is saying it's not really stressful or causing distress, but is it interfering to a significant degree and trying to speak or talk to the person about that. Like for example, one of the individuals I worked with who the county was threatening eviction, he didn't see any problem with his difficulty. He didn't experience distress, either related to that perceived need to save or the difficulty discarding. Well he did, but he didn't subjectively identify that as a problem, and so he had decided that there was distress when he was deciding to get rid of things, so he would keep them, and the excessive acquisition brought pleasure for him or it was something that he enjoyed doing, so the only piece that led to the impairment was someone from the outside saying that he had a problem. But they had power so they were the one threatening eviction, and so then even though he didn't have insight into his disorder, he didn't have insight into the difficulty. It actually had caused a lot of problems with his relationships, like he was estranged from his whole family but he didn't have insight that the hoarding was a part of that really, and so really the only area--he did agree with the fact that yeah this is causing distress and I will be impaired if I don't have a home to live in, I won't be able to do anything if I don't have a home, and so at that point, the diagnosis was still warranted because of the situation and because of the distress around that.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. I don't have a clear answer, I guess. It does come down to like a [INAUDIBLE 34:35] judgment on my part sometimes about whether it's getting in the way of their ability to function and their intended use. You're right, there can be gray zones.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yes, I think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis I actually did a memory [INAUDIBLE 47:57] and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yes, so you will see certainly when you come into some of these places and again there’s a range of things, so sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes what you see is tons and tons of old pet food, bags of dog food, bags of cat food, empty cans of cat food, empty cans of dog food, you know litter bags, etc. So some of it is the (INAUDIBLE 37:08) of having animals and I don’t know that they’re hoarding that, they just don’t throw it away and that’s just how their lives are organized.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yes, yeah that also is something...like I have clients who will only hoard brand-new item, like electronics, but they have the same feelings towards these objects even though they haven't used them, they have no immediate use for it, it's cluttering up you know. They can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so I think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. So, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. I think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working [INAUDIBLE 21:25] what they think is valuable or not.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: You know because it--well, I come across people who are very poor and they\\'re saving things to sell and they\\'re not saving the same kinds of things. And actually they actually do sell them, unlike someone with hoarding who might say, \"oh I intend to sell them\" but nothing ever proceeds. And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I\\'ve seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn\\'t hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row. So it doesn\\'t look like intentionally saved containers, like somebody might wash out their containers and might have 150 of them. But they\\'re not just discarded with the food still in them right by the bed.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yup and that was a big debate and that’s where there were (INAUDIBLE, 47:10) and I disagreed because they were kind of writing the criteria and I think even one of their own rating scales, hoarding rating scales, that kind of implies that everybody with hoarding disorder has poor insight and doesn’t want to discard.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yup, yup, exactly. And I think the other thing that goes into that is because most people don't seek treatment until like their 50s or like midlife, that if you think about the outcome of these symptoms that happen early, I think that one of the reasons is that it takes years for things to accumulate. Like it takes years and years and years for a lot of these folks to actually acquire enough to actually compromise living space.

They\\'ll say, \"I\\'m totally happy with the situation as it is\" and they might even deny that they would be distressed if they had to throw items away. But even then it would be hypothetical distress, but they might even deny that.

So you have again the situation where one person is saying, \"I\\'m not distressed\" and we\\'re saying, \"Oh yes you are.\" You know what I mean?

Like really not being able to perceive reality in a concrete way, really believing strongly in that a piece of paper or an empty can are just super super valuable or looking at a space that is unusable and you can't even walk in and just seeing no clutter.

So, some people kind of apply this criteria to mean they are distressed by their behavior, their behavior distresses them and they recognize that their life is impaired, and other people say \"No, actually that\\'s not required at all, that\\'s not what\\'s meant by distress, what\\'s meant is that they would hypothetically experience distress if they were discarding. So there is no actual distress in the disorder itself, when they keep their items they\\'re fine, but if you try to make them throw it away, that\\'s when they would experience distress and that\\'s what the criteria is getting at.

It just so happened that it was an art collection, and when they died it was an extremely valuable art collection that they had accumulated over the course of like 60 years of living in New York city and it was all donated to the MET and valued at like $6 million, but prior to them dying nobody was able to view the art, nobody was able to enter the apartment, it was basically an unlivable space.

So the construct of insight that the paper described were first defensiveness, second was anosognosia or just a lack of ability to perceive an illness or that something is wrong causing distress, the third one was overvalued ideation, which was defined as a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items that can range from mild to delusional in intensity, and the fourth one was indifference.

I think that's at the heart of it and I think the DSM does outline that. I think the one criteria I might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. I think that when we think about the internet and I already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? It might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the DSM doesn't really talk about. If an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the DSM doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, I mean I'm not sure what you would diagnose.

Unless there\\'s like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn\\'t there and it\\'s just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there\\'s a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there\\'s no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there\\'s no approaching it in any way shape or form. Most people I\\'ve worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, \"Oh yeah, I can see that\\'s a strong value, I can see how I really think that I am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however I\\'m also seeing that if I do this this way, I\\'m never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, I\\'m never going to be able to do this if I do it 100% right all the time\" so maybe there\\'s some flexibility that\\'s incorporated, even though I still strongly believe that I want to be an environmentally conscious person and I want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that\\'s where I would see there\\'s like some flexibility and it\\'s not completely like, \"I have to do it this way and we\\'re not doing it any differently\" and I think that might be one piece that might help.',\n",

So, I think, I\\'ve thought a lot about overvalued ideation and the lack of an ability to perceive a problem, like just not seeing clutter as an issue or maybe not even being able to see the clutter, really or perceive that the space, to not be able to recognize the illness in that way I think that\\'s kind of what we were talking a little bit about with insight before, that an individual just might not be able to see that there\\'s a problem. And so I think that definitely comes up a lot, I\\'ve seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, I think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, I think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. I think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. I think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, I already kind of mentioned, \"There\\'s a specific way I have to discard of this item and it\\'s so important that I do this in a very specific way and if not I\\'m a bad person,\" for example. And that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn\\'t discard in a specific kind of way, they\\'re a bad person. So there\\'s this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don\\'t want to feel like a bad person. So I think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and I think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and OCD as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like \"My rituals are important, I need to do my checking because if not I might murder somebody and I don\\'t want to be responsible for that.\"',\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think that\\'s a really good question. When we think about intended use, I think it probably does kind of come from this, I guess societal, just in general what do we use a kitchen for, what was that designed for, when someone built that home, that apartment, they thought that you would be cooking in it. But, then again, that is not obviously taking the person\\'s view point into consideration or like their own experience and their values and if they don\\'t care about cooking or that\\'s not something they ever want to do, you know, is that compromising the use? I think for the intended use, like the same thing can come up with OCD, for example, like if someone is fearful of starting a fire because of the stove, they might not use their stove or their kitchen for cooking whatsoever. It doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s cluttered, but they\\'re still not using it and so the OCD has compromised the room\\'s use, but then I\\'ve had people say, \"Well I don\\'t care about cooking, it has no value in cooking at all so I don\\'t even want to work on that because that\\'s not a value of mine,\" and so I could see how that could come up. I think with hoarding disorder what we think about is if someone moved or lived with a family member who wasn\\'t struggling with hoarding or you know, or if we were to think about what is the typical use of a kitchen, to cook, or a bedroom to sleep, I think that even if an individual suggests that that\\'s not how they intend to use it, I think the way we\\'ve looked at it is that intended use is more like the blueprint. Like what did the architect intend for this space to be used and how was that planned to be used or maybe even how did they plan to use it originally. Maybe when they first moved into the home they did a little bit of cooking, or maybe they ate at their table but now they\\'re not eating. So, I think I do like to, especially when this is just clinical practice and not a research study, I do like to kind of obviously meet the person where they\\'re at and if they don\\'t care about the kitchen or they don\\'t care about cooking, maybe they care about being able to host people in their living room and have a space for people to sit and enjoy the conversation or something like that. So, kind of looking at what uses or what are they not doing in their home that they would like to do, and then focusing on that, especially when we\\'re looking at just treatment in a community setting and not like placing my own values on somebody. Like, kitchens need to be used for cooking and focusing more on that. But in terms of diagnosis, I know that\\'s what we\\'re talking about, it\\'s an interesting question. There\\'s a little bit of a bias in thinking that others should be using their homes in a specific kind of way.',\n",

So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he's looking for.

But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",

But I hear it a lot as just like a reason for keeping something, that \"if I don\\'t have this reminder, this cue, I won\\'t remember.\" And I think I tend to challenge that in therapy, because I tend to ask people to test that out for themselves like are they sure they won\\'t remember? What tells them they won\\'t remember? Are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember.

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem.

So I kind of move in that direction and was much more [INAUDIBLE 19:29] kind of behavioral therapy training or ERP to start with back in the day before [INAUDIBLE 19:39] and Randy Frost developed more specialized treatment and kind of moved more into that model.

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that's a really good question. I think that definitely could be possible and I think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that I've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",

So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know.

Like your parents die and leave you a bunch of stuff, your children leave home and so you're now alone in the house, your marriage ends or your spouse dies and so you're more isolated? And do you as a clinician think that it's related to things like dementia, and therefore related to aging, and therefore that's why we see it as more prevalent in older adults? Or do you see it as progressive in more of a kind of social sense in the sense that people tend to have more items and be more isolated as they age?\",\n",

Clothes occupy most of his room, except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it's difficulty for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventuality finds them. When this happens, he's usually late in getting where he needs to be. For this one, do you think this person has hoarding disorder or is it more like clutter problems?\",\n",

But that\\'s the way I see it, is in effort to say do you keep stuff that other people would get rid of? And I see that as thinking and being responsive to your space. Like do you keep stuff that other people would say, \"I\\'d rather have this space than this object in my life.\" And in terms of the paintings, how I would view that would depend on what else is in the home. Like if the paintings were the only thing in the home that was making someone think, \"Oh, this is hoarding\" then I might think it doesn\\'t sound like hoarding to me.',\n",

I think, and again I think we haven't scratched the surface here, but I think it ranges from personal values and cultural elements across the cultural and societal levels. So, I sort of see that PCS model. I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding? Would the phenomenon even have roots, because it couldn't manifest in the same ways? So, I think yeah I think there's a whole pile of questions and no answers in that category, but I certainly see culture and society as being deeply influential around this problem.\",\n",

People are so focused on the clutter, what's secondary to... what's actually hoarding and what is secondary to other mental health or physical health problem. The other thing that comes up is issues around trauma, so how does trauma kind of fit in. So, you know, some of the comorbidity research shows that there's a low rate of PTSD. Folks I've met with will talk about a traumatic event, it doesn't mean that it's PTSD and there's some myths out there that trauma causes hoarding and the research doesn't really support that.

You know, anecdotally, I have had a couple patients talk about that and talk about that when they were younger or not having, yeah not having food or not necessarily having what they need, and so ultimately wanting to and kind of learning not to waste, right, talking about that sort of idea of like I shouldn\\'t waste anything because there was a time that I didn\\'t have anything and maybe in the future I might not have anything. Or like maybe something would happen, you know, like I\\'ll need this and I\\'ll be in hard times again. And actually one of the, like an interesting case example is, I can\\'t remember his name, I think it was a Chinese artist who\\'s mother struggled with hoarding, one second I\\'m just gonna look up the name of it. Oh, Song Dong, and so she was an artist and he grew up in China and his mother basically there was just like economic difficulties in China as he was--or as she was growing up, and so she learned basically to save and to not waste because of those difficulties, just in case that were to happen again. Like it was just kind of a value that she learned because of what was happening in society and that was a big part of her difficulty. It was rooted in her experience as a child and not having what she needed. I\\'ve heard that form many patients and not everybody for sure, but definitely some and there was this idea that, \"I don\\'t want that to ever happen again or at least I want to do what I can to prevent that from happening if I ever were in a situation where I didn\\'t have what I needed.\" I don\\'t see that that often, but I have seen it a couple of times.',\n",

I've never diagnosed both and I don't know if there'd be a situation where you could argue that that could happen, but I've never actually diagnosed both and I think that because of the newer diagnosis and because it's related to OCD, you know, I guess technically you probably could diagnose both. I mean if you look at the why box on hoarding, I think it's still on there, although I don't know if that will change in the future or if we will continue to keep those items in OCD or look to separating the two more. I think that'll be a question for research and for a future study, like does that make sense and is it counterindicated or does OCD kind of explain a person's difficulties with hoarding, is it necessary to give them another label or not, and I guess what would prompt an individual to do that?

You know, I would never tell somebody that it\\'s a problem, it\\'s only a problem if it\\'s a problem for that person, so it would just be highlighting some of the discrepancies that the individuals might bring up as related to the individual thinking its not a problem and just be kind of highlighting that it is a problem sometimes and having the person kind of sit with it not being a problem but it is a problem, like what does that mean? You know, and kind of talking to somebody to increase their insight would be something that we would do in therapy. But yeah, I think that on some level, most people that I see have some insight. The person that I worked with who had the least amount of insight, I think the reason the person was in treatment was because of the threat of evictions.

Or do you think that the reason older people tend to have it is more related to them needing time to have accumulated that much stuff? You know, them being maybe in a social place in their lives where older people are going to be more isolated, their children have left, you know maybe left their stuff at home, they're more likely to be in a stable living space for a longer period of time rather than moving to new apartments every couple of years. Or even it's just getting picked up at that stage because they are less mobile. I guess what I'm asking is do you think it's progressive?

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, so I think that does maybe overlap some. I think maybe the difference in hoarding disorder or anxiety disorder or OCD is that, at least from the folks I\\'ve seen, it\\'s not as fixed I guess. The overvalued ideation is there, but there\\'s like enough flexibility in most people to try things differently. Unless there\\'s like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn\\'t there and it\\'s just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there\\'s a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there\\'s no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there\\'s no approaching it in any way shape or form. Most people I\\'ve worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, \"Oh yeah, I can see that\\'s a strong value, I can see how I really think that I am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however I\\'m also seeing that if I do this this way, I\\'m never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, I\\'m never going to be able to do this if I do it 100% right all the time\" so maybe there\\'s some flexibility that\\'s incorporated, even though I still strongly believe that I want to be an environmentally conscious person and I want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that\\'s where I would see there\\'s like some flexibility and it\\'s not completely like, \"I have to do it this way and we\\'re not doing it any differently\" and I think that might be one piece that might help.',\n",

       "  'Interviewer (22:00): Okay.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah I would love to read that, yeah. Okay I do have some thoughts about that. So, I think, I\\'ve thought a lot about overvalued ideation and the lack of an ability to perceive a problem, like just not seeing clutter as an issue or maybe not even being able to see the clutter, really or perceive that the space, to not be able to recognize the illness in that way I think that\\'s kind of what we were talking a little bit about with insight before, that an individual just might not be able to see that there\\'s a problem. And so I think that definitely comes up a lot, I\\'ve seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, I think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, I think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. I think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. I think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, I already kind of mentioned, \"There\\'s a specific way I have to discard of this item and it\\'s so important that I do this in a very specific way and if not I\\'m a bad person,\" for example. And that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn\\'t discard in a specific kind of way, they\\'re a bad person. So there\\'s this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don\\'t want to feel like a bad person. So I think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and I think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and OCD as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like \"My rituals are important, I need to do my checking because if not I might murder somebody and I don\\'t want to be responsible for that.\"',\n",

So I kind of move in that direction and was much more [INAUDIBLE 19:29] kind of behavioral therapy training or ERP to start with back in the day before [INAUDIBLE 19:39] and Randy Frost developed more specialized treatment and kind of moved more into that model.

So, I sort of see that PCS model. I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding? Would the phenomenon even have roots, because it couldn't manifest in the same ways?

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, so I think that does maybe overlap some. I think maybe the difference in hoarding disorder or anxiety disorder or OCD is that, at least from the folks I\\'ve seen, it\\'s not as fixed I guess. The overvalued ideation is there, but there\\'s like enough flexibility in most people to try things differently. Unless there\\'s like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn\\'t there and it\\'s just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there\\'s a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there\\'s no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there\\'s no approaching it in any way shape or form. Most people I\\'ve worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, \"Oh yeah, I can see that\\'s a strong value, I can see how I really think that I am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however I\\'m also seeing that if I do this this way, I\\'m never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, I\\'m never going to be able to do this if I do it 100% right all the time\" so maybe there\\'s some flexibility that\\'s incorporated, even though I still strongly believe that I want to be an environmentally conscious person and I want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that\\'s where I would see there\\'s like some flexibility and it\\'s not completely like, \"I have to do it this way and we\\'re not doing it any differently\" and I think that might be one piece that might help.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think the cases of hoarding if I have the kind of clinical information that I was just telling you about, I don't feel like I've struggled very much in those domains. But sometimes I'm called by a community organization and they describe a dwelling to me and I haven't had the opportunity to talk to the person or conduct clinical assessments, I find those nearly impossible because I refuse to sort of say something just based on the volume of possessions alone, but I think the more difficult clinical decisions for me have been differential diagnostic decisions and I can think immediately of one case where there was the saving of rather bizarre items, and I was differentially trying to diagnose whether the hoarding was secondary to OCD or whether hoarding was primary and there were two primary co-occurring conditions. It was very tricky, I think the number of cases where we have hoarding in the context of OCD and kind of bizarre saving are limited. You know, they don't number many overall, so I find those very tricky to figure out what the driver is, what the obsessions and compulsions are. The other situation that I currently am working in and is of great interest to me from a research perspective, but having to do with diagnostics is hoarding in cases of severe substance abuse. So, in downtown east side of Vancouver, in the single room occupancy, SRO housing, there's a very very high drug-use rate, opioids largely and hoarding in SROs is overwhelming, this portion of the city and it's very tricky to figure out if the hoarding is secondary to the substance abuse, if it is a more primal sort of animal kind of instinct hoarding, you know the nesting kind of hoarding that Stephanie Preston has written about, or whether it's primary hoarding. And if it is primary hoarding, is it for, you know, for a means to an end of living because these people are in such obvious poverty. So, those conditions where it's not only a co-occurring other diagnostic problem like substance abuse, but the social elements of life I think really complicate diagnosis sometimes.\",\n",

Um, but that one case who comes clearly to my mind was somebody where I realized after time that only when frankly, anyway there's a number of complications in his case that make it even more interesting and complicated, but I ended up coming to the decision that he had, I called him a delusional disorder and it was with regard to the animals because he describes himself as safe keeping them and taking care of these animals that would otherwise be destroyed eventually, and when I next had contact was after there had been a home inspection and housing authorities and SPCA etcetera had gotten involved, and they reported animals in his home that had died and in deplorable conditions. And even so, when I met him he maintained in a way that I found seemed totally believable and frankly delusional that he was taking good care of them.\",\n",

So, some people really like having clutter around, they feel better in a space that's more full of items than others, and we wouldn't think that that's strange, but it crosses a line with hoarding disorder in terms of safety and sometimes not with distress, sometimes with distress. So, I'm wondering again, like the beautiful example you gave of the man with his bespoke suits, would it be possible to have hoarding disorder with, for example, digital media?

       "  'P2: Yeah okay um so just the last part of that question was just to have you think through and this is just a useful exercise because it makes it very concrete um to think through a specific case or cases that was challenging for you to diagnose either clinically or in research because it was on the border between pathological and non pathological behavior um perhaps it was almost sub-clinical or for other reasons perhaps it was it was similar to another mental health disorder and on that border or again you give the example of one you don’t have cluttered house but you know had clutter in storage spaces so could you think of a specific case that was challenging for any of those reason and kind of talk through how you end up making the decision',\n",
       "  'P2: Yeah that would be helpful and we’ve also kind of wondered and this is perhaps another issue for another day um we’ve wondered how difficult it would be to recruit hoarders for these interviews um and have thought about perhaps seeing if we could recruit collaborators to help us find hoarders to interview so if you would be game um for that kind of role of collaboration with us as well we can talk about that you know we’d have to obviously figure it out before logistically and in terms of the IRB um but um that might also be helpful depending on how our recruitment goes',\n",

       "  'P2: Yeah um I mean that sounds good to me I certainly hadn’t thought about that until you brought it up but I think that would be a really good outcome from the interviews that were doing to try to put something like that together um and so yeah one way that we could move forward is certainly when we’ve done a bunch of interviews with with experts so we’re interviewing experts starting with experts but I think that we’re going to work out towards the periphery once we are able to with out time and kind of resource constraints and use that to make a survey that we could like you said really front line people who are understanding this disorder and I think it will be interesting to try to build that component like to what extent is that due to popular media depictions of it to you know to what extent is it really strictly based on the DSM five and you know and you know to really see you know also I would be interested in knowing how much your average frontline social worker um psychiatrist or psychologist encounters this in their practice like is this an issue everyday or is think something they have never heard about or thought about so yeah we could certainly do that when we are in a further stage in our interviews um I think that also something I think about that we have talked about would be really great to have you be involved with this we’ve talked about kind of out of theses clinicians interviews kind of coming up with a smaller group of really of key informants or key experts who we can talk through the issues um the emerge as we as we catch them like maybe have a working group of something from the study that we can touch base with periodically either via phone or email and say you know ‘we’re interested in this but what should we do?',\n",

       "  \"P3: Ah okay hm, so I think one of these would be um would be the the psychological reasons for not getting rid of things or for keeping things so for for example for collecting behaviors, the underlying mechanism would be would be would be very different from hoarding and um so and with hording the collection is more um to deal with um sentimental reasons and more emotional and more fear based, and and it creates a lot of shame, but compare with um um um collecting behaviors, like healthy collecting behaviors, is more more uh got a lot of pride it's not as much shame and um and also with hoarding um its yeah, it's more the psychological reasons of not getting rid of things more that the physical capacity or practical concerns.\",\n",

       "  \"P3: Hm I think it would depend on what what item it is, but uh i'll just imagine the the most extreme case so, the most extreme case is that they would um for example, one person keeping um her moms um uh han-hand like the check um that had her moms handwriting, um so she would she would be one hundred percent sure that she has to keep it and because if she doesn’t keep it then she won't have anything with her moms handwriting on it and uh her reasoning is, ‘this is so um this is so um so like like this is so important how can I let go of this?’, this is impossible I would never, I would never do that.\",\n",

So I think it sort of depends on… it can be dependent on the skill of the practitioner or it may also be dependent on the individual child and how difficult it is to them to deal with so. Yeah, but I think understanding that it is not going to solely an unpleasant experience both for the child and the parent. I think it is helpful.

I think often… therapy is relatively limited and you are going to have to have more outside parental involvement. So I think that can be challenging for parents. It can be difficult to them to put their child in that situation. It is unpleasant for them. So um yeah… it goes against sort of your parental instincts.

I don\\'t know what that would look like and how I would feel comfortable applying the diagnostic criteria, unless they were really distressed by their accumulation or reported spending too much time and effort, for example, on trying to catalog or organize it, I haven\\'t read into that. But I think that if I heard somebody with that kind of description, where they\\'ve said, \"I myself am distressed by my electronic accumulation, I spend too much time acquiring electronic materials, I can\\'t organize them to find what I want and it\\'s troubling me and getting in the way because I\\'m spending so much effort on it,\" that would probably be them somebody I might end up diagnosing as an OCRD not otherwise specified kind of situation.

I have a lady like that with OCD and hoarding, she's been evicted 5 times, she generally over the years has denied that her hoarding is a big problem it just angers others around her.

I've never diagnosed both and I don't know if there'd be a situation where you could argue that that could happen, but I've never actually diagnosed both and I think that because of the newer diagnosis and because it's related to OCD, you know, I guess technically you probably could diagnose both. I mean if you look at the why box on hoarding, I think it's still on there, although I don't know if that will change in the future or if we will continue to keep those items in OCD or look to separating the two more. I think that'll be a question for research and for a future study, like does that make sense and is it counterindicated or does OCD kind of explain a person's difficulties with hoarding, is it necessary to give them another label or not, and I guess what would prompt an individual to do that?

There can be barriers to someone being willing to take a risk and throw away a plastic can in the trash and that can be something that someone is just not willing to do, and if that\\'s the case then we can\\'t do an exposure around it and we\\'re kind of stuck, in a way, or we can become stuck if their overvalued ideation kind of prevents them from actually doing the exercises as related to the therapy.',\n",

He has the ability to function beautifully in his house and has people over all the time, his butler helps him keep his clothing collection organized, there's no hardship. From a neurobiological perspective, I think he's somebody who in a research study if our criteria didn't exclude him, would probably show the same neurobiological issues but don't think that clinically he's at threshold, because of his material wealth and ability to live comfortably.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Sure, so I'm a trained psychologist and social worker and I came to my work with hoarding actually through work with OCD first and then began working more with people with hoarding over time. I think based on my earlier experiences, some people found it very frustrating to work with people with hoarding, I more challenging but fascinating as well. So I kind of move in that direction and was much more [INAUDIBLE 19:29] kind of behavioral therapy training or ERP to start with back in the day before [INAUDIBLE 19:39] and Randy Frost developed more specialized treatment and kind of moved more into that model. And then I've kind of expanded into multiple models in terms of thinking about various domains and working in housing and public health and other areas as well. So, have kind of like expanded out in that, but definitely come from a mental health background in terms of training.\",\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Um, for the most part I feel like criteria works pretty well, actually. I\\'ve questioned, in the early days I was strongly influenced by Gail Steketee and Randy Frost, thinking about acquiring as a core feature and wondered if it shouldn\\'t be up there as a diagnostic feature, but over the years I\\'ve seen so many who don\\'t endorse it as an active part, that if it were a requirement for diagnosis, it would have to be an option, right, it would have to be not absolutely required. So, I think that\\'s actually fair, that\\'s been a change in my thinking over the years. I sometimes think the language around the urge to save things is just a little bit, maybe just a little bit awkward potentially, because I think when I meet with individuals, you know it just says difficulty discarding regardless of the actual--the need to save due to distress associated with discarding. I think that\\'s part of it, but for many of them it\\'s also the strong urge to keep things. And sometimes I will meet people who say, \"It\\'s not that I can\\'t discard them, I just feel the need to keep everything cuz I might want it or need it.\" So, sometimes the way that the criteria is phrased sometimes seems like a slightly awkward fit to me for that reason.',\n",

In the absence of saving other objects, I'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. For me, the times that I have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly. One case that I can think of, yeah so I don't think strictly it would been the criteria because it wouldn't meet that interference piece, but if it were in the context of other things, perhaps.\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I can think of maybe a couple of cases. I think where it can get tricky is that hoarding, or individuals who struggle with hoarding, tend to...or the traits tend to show up when they're relatively young, so like adolescent years. And I think that if someone is struggling early on, and they're not actually acquiring enough or having difficulties discarding enough where it's like resulting in clutter that's actually compromising their space or that's like a hazard, then according to the criteria, then it wouldn't be criteria for diagnosis. So, someone might be struggling with hoarding or acquiring objects excessively and might be struggling with discarding, but if they can still use all the spaces in their home, then that kind of puts you in a tricky spot. Because what if not giving this person the diagnosis means they don't get services; however, they don't meet diagnosis, so you can't give them the diagnosis because they don't have the clutter or the, if their home isn't compromised in that way and their space isn't compromised in that way, then you can't come up with a diagnosis at the level of significance where it would need a diagnosis. So that would be, you know, I actually haven't, the only place I've seen that come up is in our research study, because we're looking at folks who are a little less severe and because we don't, because or IRB, we're not seeing people who are being threatened with eviction or because we're going into the home, there can't be mold, there can't be...you know, clutter can't be stacked super high because of earthquake risk and things like that, and so we're actually seeing folks who do kind of fall in that line of is it actually hoarding disorder? Does this meet criteria? And I think for some folks we've had to say no it doesn't, because their home doesn't, the only thing they're saving is the revised inventory questionnaire, if it doesn't meet the threshold, like if they don't have that perceived need to save to the degree that causes impairment or causes distress, then we wouldn't diagnose. So I think taking a look at things like the savings inventory revised or the clutter image rating scale, having a person do those can help you see what actually, is this actually pathological as well as asking them more subjectively like what their home is like and what's their experience inside their home.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I think for me the first three I would say I see in equal distribution frequently, and sometimes overlapping. The indifference is...I see far less I would say, at least as I understand Randy to have been talking about it, and I think I also would say about the first three that I see them as present at different levels and with fluctuation as I was saying earlier. So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know. So, yeah I think I could probably count on two hands the number of patients out of the hundreds that I've worked with where the indifference was very strong. I think it's a much more limited feature from my perspective.\",\n",

And if the person is using substances, making that assessment is next to impossible actually.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think the cases of hoarding if I have the kind of clinical information that I was just telling you about, I don't feel like I've struggled very much in those domains. But sometimes I'm called by a community organization and they describe a dwelling to me and I haven't had the opportunity to talk to the person or conduct clinical assessments, I find those nearly impossible because I refuse to sort of say something just based on the volume of possessions alone, but I think the more difficult clinical decisions for me have been differential diagnostic decisions and I can think immediately of one case where there was the saving of rather bizarre items, and I was differentially trying to diagnose whether the hoarding was secondary to OCD or whether hoarding was primary and there were two primary co-occurring conditions. It was very tricky, I think the number of cases where we have hoarding in the context of OCD and kind of bizarre saving are limited. You know, they don't number many overall, so I find those very tricky to figure out what the driver is, what the obsessions and compulsions are. The other situation that I currently am working in and is of great interest to me from a research perspective, but having to do with diagnostics is hoarding in cases of severe substance abuse. So, in downtown east side of Vancouver, in the single room occupancy, SRO housing, there's a very very high drug-use rate, opioids largely and hoarding in SROs is overwhelming, this portion of the city and it's very tricky to figure out if the hoarding is secondary to the substance abuse, if it is a more primal sort of animal kind of instinct hoarding, you know the nesting kind of hoarding that Stephanie Preston has written about, or whether it's primary hoarding. And if it is primary hoarding, is it for, you know, for a means to an end of living because these people are in such obvious poverty. So, those conditions where it's not only a co-occurring other diagnostic problem like substance abuse, but the social elements of life I think really complicate diagnosis sometimes.\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewer: So, there was this paper published by Randy Frost where he talks about the concept of insight, and he in the paper broke it down into different constructs, and I'd like to read you these constructs and have you think with me through which in your mind are the most important or how you see them related to each other. So the constructs that randy came up with are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness, overvalued ideation, so that would be more of a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items, or indifference. Um, and I'm wondering how you see these fitting together in people's insight. So, these are interesting to me because they are so varied. So, overvalued ideation or anosognosia even, sound almost more like a delusional disorder where you're looking at an item and you have an unreasonable belief that the item is more valuable than it is, or you're looking at your space and you think that your space looks normal, even though is objectively, you know no one with objectivity would see it as normal. Whereas defensiveness is much more based on behavior and indifference also is very behavioral and seems sort of like related to depression and just not caring about space. So, I guess what I'm getting at with this question is how do you think about these and do you see them all as equally relevant or do you feel like some are more central to insight as you understand it in hoarding disorder?\",\n",

So, they may look at like a newspaper from 10 years ago the same as they would a brand new book. So, they don\\'t know what to discard, they have no starting point so when they start to think about discarding you can tell by body language that they\\'re having difficulty even deciding what item to pick up and then getting distressed when thinking about what to do with it. So, it\\'s not just about like, \"I\\'m gonna get rid of...in this table I\\'m gonna pick up all the garbage and throw the garbage away,\" but what is garbage and what isn\\'t garbage. So, I think that is a distress because when they try to make a decision, they just kind of shut down and they can\\'t make that decision. So, they have difficulty knowing where to start, and then the anxiety that they get. So, a lot of times they\\'ll do self-talk like, \"well I guess I could get rid of this,\" or \"I could use this for this\" or you know, they can\\'t really make that one decision quickly. They have to kind of go through the motions of what if. They always talk about what ifs, and I know they\\'re starting to get distressed when they\\'re thinking about all the possibilities. When they\\'re trying to make a decision it\\'s, \"what could go wrong.\" They start catastrophizing, you know, \"if I got rid of this item,\" kind of think about the worst possible thing that could happen, instead of just, \"I\\'m getting rid of it and then it\\'s out of my head.\" And then they will start to ruminate on the possibility that they made a mistake if they do make a decision, so that\\'s kind of how I measure distress.

So, I sort of see that PCS model. I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding? Would the phenomenon even have roots, because it couldn't manifest in the same ways?

I think that's at the heart of it and I think the DSM does outline that. I think the one criteria I might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. I think that when we think about the internet and I already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? It might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the DSM doesn't really talk about. If an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the DSM doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, I mean I'm not sure what you would diagnose.

So, if you owned a mansion and were very very rich and could afford kind of infinite storage units, such that your space was never compromised, would you ever have hoarding disorder? Would you ever meet criteria for hoarding disorder?

And so I think that definitely comes up a lot, I\\'ve seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, I think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, I think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. I think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. I think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, I already kind of mentioned, \"There\\'s a specific way I have to discard of this item and it\\'s so important that I do this in a very specific way and if not I\\'m a bad person,\" for example. And that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn\\'t discard in a specific kind of way, they\\'re a bad person. So there\\'s this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don\\'t want to feel like a bad person. So I think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and I think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and OCD as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like \"My rituals are important, I need to do my checking because if not I might murder somebody and I don\\'t want to be responsible for that.\"',\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I can think of maybe a couple of cases. I think where it can get tricky is that hoarding, or individuals who struggle with hoarding, tend to...or the traits tend to show up when they're relatively young, so like adolescent years. And I think that if someone is struggling early on, and they're not actually acquiring enough or having difficulties discarding enough where it's like resulting in clutter that's actually compromising their space or that's like a hazard, then according to the criteria, then it wouldn't be criteria for diagnosis. So, someone might be struggling with hoarding or acquiring objects excessively and might be struggling with discarding, but if they can still use all the spaces in their home, then that kind of puts you in a tricky spot. Because what if not giving this person the diagnosis means they don't get services; however, they don't meet diagnosis, so you can't give them the diagnosis because they don't have the clutter or the, if their home isn't compromised in that way and their space isn't compromised in that way, then you can't come up with a diagnosis at the level of significance where it would need a diagnosis. So that would be, you know, I actually haven't, the only place I've seen that come up is in our research study, because we're looking at folks who are a little less severe and because we don't, because or IRB, we're not seeing people who are being threatened with eviction or because we're going into the home, there can't be mold, there can't be...you know, clutter can't be stacked super high because of earthquake risk and things like that, and so we're actually seeing folks who do kind of fall in that line of is it actually hoarding disorder? Does this meet criteria? And I think for some folks we've had to say no it doesn't, because their home doesn't, the only thing they're saving is the revised inventory questionnaire, if it doesn't meet the threshold, like if they don't have that perceived need to save to the degree that causes impairment or causes distress, then we wouldn't diagnose. So I think taking a look at things like the savings inventory revised or the clutter image rating scale, having a person do those can help you see what actually, is this actually pathological as well as asking them more subjectively like what their home is like and what's their experience inside their home.\",\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that\\'s a really good question. With insight I think how I determine insight is like the ability for an individual to recognize or yeah, to recognize that something is an issue or a problem, ultimately. So, this can come up in OCD a lot as well, you know, or this is actually another example that\\'s related, like if someone is having relationship OCD or like is experiencing obsessions about their relationship, they might not see those thoughts as obsessive necessarily, because they might seem valid or warranted. Like, \"Oh this person\\'s bothering me, maybe I sue this person, that\\'s something that I should actually consider.\" So, in that way a person with OCD might not recognize that that\\'s actually OCD and we need to target that in treatment as OCD, and so if they\\'re not going to conceptualize it as OCD, we can\\'t do exposure therapy and we can\\'t treat it in the way we treat other OCD symptoms. So it would be very similar with hoarding disorder, if someone is not seeing that the clutter is an issue and is not able to have insight into the way that it\\'s impacting them, and I think that\\'s ultimately what I think of insight, I think about there being a disconnect between like the consequences. Like I guess not realizing or understanding the consequences of the behavior, so that an individual doesn\\'t actually see their difficulty discarding as leading to relationship issues or leading to issues with them working or doing their hobbies. Like there\\'s that kind of lack of insight into the ways that the problems are impacting them, is kind of how I conceptualize it. I know that insight, and actually somebody on our team who\\'s a psychiatrist and again I\\'m a psychologist, he approaches insight differently and I missed his talk but he was just talking about the brain structures and the ways that the research on insight in general on different psychiatric disorders and how the brain, you know, what circuits might be related to loss of insight or a lack of insight in different disorders.',\n",

If a patient has very low insight and doesn\\'t think that their hoarding is a problem, you know, denies that they are at all distressed and says they\\'re perfectly happy with their space the way that it is, how is the distress kind of criteria met or if the person says they\\'re not impaired, how do you determine what constitutes impairment?',\n",

When we think about intended use, I think it probably does kind of come from this, I guess societal, just in general what do we use a kitchen for, what was that designed for, when someone built that home, that apartment, they thought that you would be cooking in it. But, then again, that is not obviously taking the person\\'s view point into consideration or like their own experience and their values and if they don\\'t care about cooking or that\\'s not something they ever want to do, you know, is that compromising the use? I think for the intended use, like the same thing can come up with OCD, for example, like if someone is fearful of starting a fire because of the stove, they might not use their stove or their kitchen for cooking whatsoever. It doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s cluttered, but they\\'re still not using it and so the OCD has compromised the room\\'s use, but then I\\'ve had people say, \"Well I don\\'t care about cooking, it has no value in cooking at all so I don\\'t even want to work on that because that\\'s not a value of mine,\" and so I could see how that could come up. I think with hoarding disorder what we think about is if someone moved or lived with a family member who wasn\\'t struggling with hoarding or you know, or if we were to think about what is the typical use of a kitchen, to cook, or a bedroom to sleep, I think that even if an individual suggests that that\\'s not how they intend to use it, I think the way we\\'ve looked at it is that intended use is more like the blueprint. Like what did the architect intend for this space to be used and how was that planned to be used or maybe even how did they plan to use it originally. Maybe when they first moved into the home they did a little bit of cooking, or maybe they ate at their table but now they\\'re not eating. So, I think I do like to, especially when this is just clinical practice and not a research study, I do like to kind of obviously meet the person where they\\'re at and if they don\\'t care about the kitchen or they don\\'t care about cooking, maybe they care about being able to host people in their living room and have a space for people to sit and enjoy the conversation or something like that. So, kind of looking at what uses or what are they not doing in their home that they would like to do, and then focusing on that, especially when we\\'re looking at just treatment in a community setting and not like placing my own values on somebody. Like, kitchens need to be used for cooking and focusing more on that. But in terms of diagnosis, I know that\\'s what we\\'re talking about, it\\'s an interesting question. There\\'s a little bit of a bias in thinking that others should be using their homes in a specific kind of way.',\n",

But, I\\'m a little hard pressed, because if it were solely the digital media, I\\'ve not seen someone where it\\'s solely digital accumulation without physical accumulation of other material. So, in those cases where I\\'ve seen the two coexisting, I would say that the electronic acquiring or accumulation is a feature of their hoarding difficulty. I guess I haven\\'t been presented with a person who solely accumulates digitally and who would say their living circumstances physically are fine. I don\\'t know what that would look like and how I would feel comfortable applying the diagnostic criteria, unless they were really distressed by their accumulation or reported spending too much time and effort, for example, on trying to catalog or organize it, I haven\\'t read into that. But I think that if I heard somebody with that kind of description, where they\\'ve said, \"I myself am distressed by my electronic accumulation, I spend too much time acquiring electronic materials, I can\\'t organize them to find what I want and it\\'s troubling me and getting in the way because I\\'m spending so much effort on it,\" that would probably be them somebody I might end up diagnosing as an OCRD not otherwise specified kind of situation.

So, they may look at like a newspaper from 10 years ago the same as they would a brand new book. So, they don\\'t know what to discard, they have no starting point so when they start to think about discarding you can tell by body language that they\\'re having difficulty even deciding what item to pick up and then getting distressed when thinking about what to do with it. So, it\\'s not just about like, \"I\\'m gonna get rid of...in this table I\\'m gonna pick up all the garbage and throw the garbage away,\" but what is garbage and what isn\\'t garbage. So, I think that is a distress because when they try to make a decision, they just kind of shut down and they can\\'t make that decision. So, they have difficulty knowing where to start, and then the anxiety that they get. So, a lot of times they\\'ll do self-talk like, \"well I guess I could get rid of this,\" or \"I could use this for this\" or you know, they can\\'t really make that one decision quickly. They have to kind of go through the motions of what if. They always talk about what ifs, and I know they\\'re starting to get distressed when they\\'re thinking about all the possibilities. When they\\'re trying to make a decision it\\'s, \"what could go wrong.\" They start catastrophizing, you know, \"if I got rid of this item,\" kind of think about the worst possible thing that could happen, instead of just, \"I\\'m getting rid of it and then it\\'s out of my head.\" And then they will start to ruminate on the possibility that they made a mistake if they do make a decision, so that\\'s kind of how I measure distress.

So, many people I see will say when they look back absolutely as it's been reported in other studies, you know they identified difficulty with discarding going back to their early adult years or teens or sometimes even late childhood, but the accumulation took time to get out of control and quite often I find hoarders that I see who are usually in their 40s to 60s, although I've seen some younger ones, will often say it got out of control because of environmental changes. Their spouse left them of their relationship ended or their children moved out or their aging parents downsized or died. And as a result they've been presented with even more stuff and it totally overwhelmed their ability and their limited ability to cope with it and to deal. At that point, they now recognize the problem. So, I think there's a bit of an artificiality in our saying it's more prevalent among the elderly, which is simply related to the objective reality, which is that it takes years for the accumulation in many cases to really reach that threshold of intolerance or impairment that's recognized by the individual.\",\n",

So this was a young woman, maybe in her 30s, she had moved into her apartment maybe only 8 months earlier, so she hadn't lived there very long. It's a very small apartment, her kitchen and living room were kind of all together like in one area, and her bedroom was a separate room, and the photos of the kitchen itself, like the place where you would prepare food and store things did not look hoarded at all. It looked extremely functional in the kitchen, but once you stepped away from the counters, there were piles of things that were more disorganized, but she described the things as not being hers or being temporarily there. Like for example, there were some closet doors that she said belonged to the landlord. And I have a hard time knowing when somebody says that, that this object is temporarily there it just belongs to someone else, I have a hard time knowing how to evaluate that in the context of hoarding because people tell themselves stories about objects in their homes. About, oh yes this belongs to someone else, and they kind of...the fact that is has sat there for a while and it's actually going to sit there for the next five years is not part of the story that they tell themselves. So, I don't quite know how to evaluate it. The most problematic room was her bedroom, however, where the mattress was on the floor and there was no visible floor space in the entire length of the room and she described this situation as being due to the fact that in the previous apartment, her bed had been a loft and she hadn't yet been able to get a bed up on a loft because it takes 3 people to handle the loft. And that under the bed, once the loft was there, would be perfect storage space for all this stuff that was in her bedroom. The things in her bedroom included bikes and quite a large pile of pillows that was not actually on her bed, and the photos made it clear that she actually sleeps on a tiny part of the bed because the rest of the bed is covered with stuff. And so it, partly because the photo was of a bed on the floor, so like if your bed is up, like my bed is a couple feet above the floor, that means that if my possessions were at the height of the bed, that would be two and a half feet of debris. But her bed was on the floor, so it made it look a little fuller than it was. But it's still true that you couldn't walk in it, and she said she couldn't walk over to the other side of the bedroom, so I have a really hard time trying to sort out, especially because different areas of the home had different functional abilities. Like the bedroom looked pretty not functional, the kitchen looked perfectly functional. So yeah, that was a hard one for me.\",\n",

You know, them being maybe in a social place in their lives where older people are going to be more isolated, their children have left, you know maybe left their stuff at home, they're more likely to be in a stable living space for a longer period of time rather than moving to new apartments every couple of years.

I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember. So I might reflect that as well, like it sounds like, and maybe even asking somebody like, \"Have you thought about that memory in the last 10 years even without the cue of the item?\" And I think that can be a way to get at whether or not they\\'re actually [INAUDIBLE 1:06:05] or if they\\'re difficulties with memory.

So, I think that\\'s actually fair, that\\'s been a change in my thinking over the years. I sometimes think the language around the urge to save things is just a little bit, maybe just a little bit awkward potentially, because I think when I meet with individuals, you know it just says difficulty discarding regardless of the actual--the need to save due to distress associated with discarding. I think that\\'s part of it, but for many of them it\\'s also the strong urge to keep things. And sometimes I will meet people who say, \"It\\'s not that I can\\'t discard them, I just feel the need to keep everything cuz I might want it or need it.\" So, sometimes the way that the criteria is phrased sometimes seems like a slightly awkward fit to me for that reason.',\n",

I can't think of a case where we were unclear. Certainly where we do run into issues is, and this is very different from looking at things clinically obviously, but we have folks who have other mental health issues such as schizophrenia or something like that. So sometimes for us, we're addressing the hoarding behaviors because that's what we're there for, but sometimes it's not clear, is the other mental health issue the primary factor, or is it the hoarding?

And we also collect data, so there's data about the cases, but it's quite impoverished because there's no person attached to it. The other line of my research has to do with psychological functioning in hoarding, and there we actually have people who identify as having problems with hoarding come into our research lab and we give them a diagnostic interview and a bunch of testing. I directly listen to the diagnostic interviews, so I hear--I don't conduct them but I supervise them, so I hear quite a lot of stories from these recordings.

In the absence of saving other objects, I'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. For me, the times that I have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly. One case that I can think of, yeah so I don't think strictly it would been the criteria because it wouldn't meet that interference piece, but if it were in the context of other things, perhaps.\",\n",

So they have this fear and then all of the accompanying emotions alongside the fear about what will happen if I don't have this object, and what leads me to say that is when I hear these justifications from clients, it's often accompanied by a clear articulation of a very bad thing that would happen to them or to someone that they loved, ranging from some bodily harm to something akin to some kind of disaster. So, it feels to me not like a justification, it seems that it is this primal urge that is driven by fear and fear's powerful, right?

So, I think there's a lack of looking at the [INAUDIBLE 17:22] spaces with the diagnosis. So, I think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. And you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. I also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. Like in the area where I live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience.

So, usually they've been managing it, you know they've always had a little bit too much stuff but something has prompted them to stop managing it, and then it became out of control like a health issue, or caring for a family member, or loss of the family member, some big event.

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem.

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, I think for me the first three I would say I see in equal distribution frequently, and sometimes overlapping. The indifference is...I see far less I would say, at least as I understand Randy to have been talking about it, and I think I also would say about the first three that I see them as present at different levels and with fluctuation as I was saying earlier. So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know. So, yeah I think I could probably count on two hands the number of patients out of the hundreds that I've worked with where the indifference was very strong. I think it's a much more limited feature from my perspective.\",\n",

Toothpaste caps are not commonly accepted as a collectible, art is. Even weird little things like things that have ducks on them, are recognized. It might not be something that I would want to collect, but people collect them. And hoarding involves a collection of things that don't, like I could see a guy who collected these age-old vitamin bottles because...I mean they were empty, he had eaten the vitamins out of them, but they don't make them the same way anymore. They've changed the style of bottle for this vitamin, so he saw that as a collection but I didn't see that as a collection. And [INAUDIBLE 47:56] why not [laughs], that's where I kind of in depth thinking well because society doesn't say it's a collection.\",\n",

I\\'m in a collaboration with, I think you\\'re also talking with my colleague she\\'s [NAME 45:45] who\\'s a clinical psychologist at [INSTITUTION 45:46] and we are in a collaborative partnership with a third person who\\'s name is [NAME 45:51] and he is a sociologist where I choose to have my academic life and social work, he\\'s in sociology and we\\'re writing a paper right now with some of these concepts in them called, \"Making Room\" is our working title, but yeah I\\'d be delighted. There\\'s not a lot of conversation about this, so anytime you\\'d like feel free to reach out.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, good question. So, I think the really big difference, there\\'s a couple key differences I think, a lot of people collect and I think...I can\\'t remember what year it was but I don\\'t remember the percentage but there was a study done in the UK and it showed like 25% of the population engaged in collecting. So, obviously collecting is distinct from difficulties that are associated with hoarding disorder. I think one reason is that when someone\\'s collecting, they tend to be able to organize their collection and kind of store their collection away, so if they\\'re collecting stamps or what have you, they\\'re kind of organized and they have a home and then these folks tend to bring up these collections and they tend to show them off with pride, there\\'s joy associated with them like, \"look at these fans\" or maybe find other people who are interested in that particular item and they may show these items with joy and pride; whereas folks who are struggling with hoarding disorder tend to experience a lot of shame. There aren\\'t, the items aren\\'t necessarily organized in that neat, nice structured fashion and they\\'re not necessarily showing others with pride. There\\'s actually a lot of shame and distress associated with the items. I think that\\'s a key difference, and those are the primary differences, now that I\\'m thinking about it actually. Like the way in which they\\'re stored, folks with hoarding disorder don\\'t have these items stored away so they can bring them out and show people, and the feelings associated with it. So, kind of the feeling of pride when someone\\'s showing off their collection, versus somebody who is ashamed and has negative emotion around having all of these items in their home.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, okay, so and then there’s some literature and (INAUDIBLE, 15:41) and colleagues on that and the differential.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, so I [INAUDIBLE 12:33] mostly because families are involved or because of the space. You know, a lot of my clients don't actually meet clinical diagnosis, or wouldn't meet a clinical diagnosis because they may live in a facility that has certain rules or certain guidelines, or they may live with their family members or have been working on their hoarding disorder for long periods of time, but they still have the emotional attachment to objects and they still have the anxiety and the difficulty discarding and trouble with organization, so they still have all of the trouble that goes along with the hoarding disorder, but their space may not meet the diagnosis. So, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it. So, they may still be suffering from the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but not actually meet a diagnosis. So, I will get clients like that often.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, so I think that does maybe overlap some. I think maybe the difference in hoarding disorder or anxiety disorder or OCD is that, at least from the folks I\\'ve seen, it\\'s not as fixed I guess. The overvalued ideation is there, but there\\'s like enough flexibility in most people to try things differently. Unless there\\'s like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn\\'t there and it\\'s just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there\\'s a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there\\'s no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there\\'s no approaching it in any way shape or form. Most people I\\'ve worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, \"Oh yeah, I can see that\\'s a strong value, I can see how I really think that I am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however I\\'m also seeing that if I do this this way, I\\'m never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, I\\'m never going to be able to do this if I do it 100% right all the time\" so maybe there\\'s some flexibility that\\'s incorporated, even though I still strongly believe that I want to be an environmentally conscious person and I want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that\\'s where I would see there\\'s like some flexibility and it\\'s not completely like, \"I have to do it this way and we\\'re not doing it any differently\" and I think that might be one piece that might help.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, so one thing I often talk about with my patients is differentiating between the difficulty they have in the way they relate to stuff, and the legacy in the years of accumulation, and I think there's inadequate weight given to that distinction. So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. Sorry I'm trying to think now what your question was.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that's a really good question. I think that definitely could be possible and I think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that I've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, so I just haven't had them, so it's a really really interesting question. Um, but that one case who comes clearly to my mind was somebody where I realized after time that only when frankly, anyway there's a number of complications in his case that make it even more interesting and complicated, but I ended up coming to the decision that he had, I called him a delusional disorder and it was with regard to the animals because he describes himself as safe keeping them and taking care of these animals that would otherwise be destroyed eventually, and when I next had contact was after there had been a home inspection and housing authorities and SPCA etcetera had gotten involved, and they reported animals in his home that had died and in deplorable conditions. And even so, when I met him he maintained in a way that I found seemed totally believable and frankly delusional that he was taking good care of them.\",\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yes, I think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis I actually did a memory [INAUDIBLE 47:57] and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yes, so I went to undergrad at [NAME 6:39] University where I majored in psychology and worked with several of the labs on campus doing research as an undergrad and became involved in a lab that studied anxiety and related disorders kind of more broadly, and so I ended up staying post my bachelor’s degree and getting a research assistant position there and a grant where I worked on anxiety treatment trials.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yes, so you will see certainly when you come into some of these places and again there’s a range of things, so sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes what you see is tons and tons of old pet food, bags of dog food, bags of cat food, empty cans of cat food, empty cans of dog food, you know litter bags, etc. So some of it is the (INAUDIBLE 37:08) of having animals and I don’t know that they’re hoarding that, they just don’t throw it away and that’s just how their lives are organized.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yes, yeah that also is something...like I have clients who will only hoard brand-new item, like electronics, but they have the same feelings towards these objects even though they haven't used them, they have no immediate use for it, it's cluttering up you know. They can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so I think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. So, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. I think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working [INAUDIBLE 21:25] what they think is valuable or not.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: You know because it--well, I come across people who are very poor and they\\'re saving things to sell and they\\'re not saving the same kinds of things. And actually they actually do sell them, unlike someone with hoarding who might say, \"oh I intend to sell them\" but nothing ever proceeds. And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I\\'ve seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn\\'t hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row. So it doesn\\'t look like intentionally saved containers, like somebody might wash out their containers and might have 150 of them.

So, for the first part of our interview, we're trying to focus on how you conceive of hoarding as a disorder, how you diagnose it, how you know it when you see it. And then we're going to move to the discussion of insight, and the purpose of this process is to understand how clinicians are looking at hoarding disorder, and then to talk to patients about how they identify the disorder in themselves and the purpose of that is to help understand the patient process of gaining insight. So, for you as a clinician, what are some of the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps collecting, and hoarding disorder?\",\n",
       "  'Interviewer: Okay. Um, so one of the difficulties with this disorder in the long literature, and I\\'m sure you encounter it in your work and in your life all the time, is the problem of insight and one of the diagnostic criteria reads, \"The difficulty discarding is due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discarding,\" and I\\'m wondering how you think about distress in this context, when people will often deny that they are distressed by kind of the state of their home and they may also deny that they would be distressed if they had to discard their items? So how do you think about that? How do you think about the way that that distress fits into this diagnosis?',\n",
       "  'Interviewer: Participation in this study involves being interviewed by us researchers from the University of Florida.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewer: So, there was this paper published by Randy Frost where he talks about the concept of insight, and he in the paper broke it down into different constructs, and I'd like to read you these constructs and have you think with me through which in your mind are the most important or how you see them related to each other. So the constructs that randy came up with are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness, overvalued ideation, so that would be more of a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items, or indifference. Um, and I'm wondering how you see these fitting together in people's insight. So, these are interesting to me because they are so varied. So, overvalued ideation or anosognosia even, sound almost more like a delusional disorder where you're looking at an item and you have an unreasonable belief that the item is more valuable than it is, or you're looking at your space and you think that your space looks normal, even though is objectively, you know no one with objectivity would see it as normal. Whereas defensiveness is much more based on behavior and indifference also is very behavioral and seems sort of like related to depression and just not caring about space. So, I guess what I'm getting at with this question is how do you think about these and do you see them all as equally relevant or do you feel like some are more central to insight as you understand it in hoarding disorder?\",\n",

So I think it sort of depends on… it can be dependent on the skill of the practitioner or it may also be dependent on the individual child and how difficult it is to them to deal with so. Yeah, but I think understanding that it is not going to solely an unpleasant experience both for the child and the parent. I think it is helpful. Although again, I think there has to be some realistic expectations, and I mean I guess it also depends on the CBT whether how much they are going to have an expectation that the parent is going to be involved. I think often… therapy is relatively limited and you are going to have to have more outside parental involvement. So I think that can be challenging for parents. It can be difficult to them to put their child in that situation. It is unpleasant for them. So um yeah… it goes against sort of your parental instincts. So I think that can be a challenge that kind of needs to be made clear to parents. That sometimes you are going to be asked or told to do things that are not what you would think, you know. Protecting your child is not always… the best way to move forward. I mean I guess the other thing is consistency…. And um yeah providing consistency because I think that’s important and I think that’s really hard, especially when you are dealing with two different parents. I don’t know.

In the absence of saving other objects, I'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. For me, the times that I have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly. One case that I can think of, yeah so I don't think strictly it would been the criteria because it wouldn't meet that interference piece, but if it were in the context of other things, perhaps.\",\n",

So, I think there's a lack of looking at the [INAUDIBLE 17:22] spaces with the diagnosis. So, I think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. And you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. I also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. Like in the area where I live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience. So, clients can't see somebody that can diagnose them with something because of the lack of experience with professionals. I have no idea if I answered your whole question [laughs].\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think the cases of hoarding if I have the kind of clinical information that I was just telling you about, I don't feel like I've struggled very much in those domains. But sometimes I'm called by a community organization and they describe a dwelling to me and I haven't had the opportunity to talk to the person or conduct clinical assessments, I find those nearly impossible because I refuse to sort of say something just based on the volume of possessions alone, but I think the more difficult clinical decisions for me have been differential diagnostic decisions and I can think immediately of one case where there was the saving of rather bizarre items, and I was differentially trying to diagnose whether the hoarding was secondary to OCD or whether hoarding was primary and there were two primary co-occurring conditions. It was very tricky, I think the number of cases where we have hoarding in the context of OCD and kind of bizarre saving are limited. You know, they don't number many overall, so I find those very tricky to figure out what the driver is, what the obsessions and compulsions are. The other situation that I currently am working in and is of great interest to me from a research perspective, but having to do with diagnostics is hoarding in cases of severe substance abuse. So, in downtown east side of Vancouver, in the single room occupancy, SRO housing, there's a very very high drug-use rate, opioids largely and hoarding in SROs is overwhelming, this portion of the city and it's very tricky to figure out if the hoarding is secondary to the substance abuse, if it is a more primal sort of animal kind of instinct hoarding, you know the nesting kind of hoarding that Stephanie Preston has written about, or whether it's primary hoarding. And if it is primary hoarding, is it for, you know, for a means to an end of living because these people are in such obvious poverty. So, those conditions where it's not only a co-occurring other diagnostic problem like substance abuse, but the social elements of life I think really complicate diagnosis sometimes.\",\n",

So there is no actual distress in the disorder itself, when they keep their items they\\'re fine, but if you try to make them throw it away, that\\'s when they would experience distress and that\\'s what the criteria is getting at.

Either things to do with the language or related to clinical judgement?\",\n",

Before we begin, I just want to know if any of the elements in the criteria in the DSM-V you find particularly difficult to apply or subjective or that you wonder if different clinicians might apply differently? Does anything jump out to you from the DSM-V?\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewer: So there's another component about the DSM-IV that talks about difficulty discarding regardless of actual value, and I'm wondering if you've ever dealt with this as a component of wondering if somebody is an individual with hoarding disorder? So, does the value of the possessions that they're saving play into your thinking about this disorder? We tend to think of individuals with hoarding disorder as saving things that are objectively valueless or over-estimating the value of items, but could you have a person who has this disorder who saves things that are valuable?\",\n",

       "  \"Interviewer: So, this criteria you're talking about, the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use, I guess I'm wondering...well two things. First of all, you gave the example of a supplemental housing situation where they only have one room, and I'm wondering how you make an assessment of hoarding disorder when people can occupy such different amounts of space. So, if you owned a mansion and were very very rich and could afford kind of infinite storage units, such that your space was never compromised, would you ever have hoarding disorder? Would you ever meet criteria for hoarding disorder? Versus somebody who is living in a one bedroom apartment where the amount of stuff they have, you know, you could have a very normal amount of stuff but if you don't have any space, your space will be congested. So, how do you take that into account and do you take that into account? Would a person who has a mansion ever have hoarding disorder if they couldn't fill up their mansion?\",\n",

Does anything spring to mind about the criteria off the top of your head?\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewer: Yeah I mean that is a question that I have about the DSM-IV as well and I was gonna ask you in particular, in situations like this how you make a judgement about whether you would consider them a person with hoarding disorder when this criteria isn't met, and it sounds like what you're saying is for you this criteria isn't a deal breaker. That they might not have congested and cluttered active living areas, but that they still might be a person with hoarding disorder. Does that?\",\n",

I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding?

So either they\\'re objectively worthless and the person thinks they\\'re worth money, or there\\'s things that the person is sentimentally attached to that it just doesn\\'t kind of make sense to be so sentimentally attached to those particular items? I guess the reason that I\\'m asking this is that I read this really interesting article this morning about a couple who their home appeared to be totally hoarded out, they couldn\\'t have people over, it was totally filled to the brim, but then they were found to actually be in the possession of a very valuable art collection, which they donated and was valued at millions of dollars. I mean it made their apartment totally non-functional for a decade, but when somebody actually went through the items, they found that they were excessively, they were actually really valuable works of art. And yes they were impairing the couple\\'s use of the home, but it was appropriate for them to be saved because they were so valuable. Would that count as hoarding disorder?

I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember. So I might reflect that as well, like it sounds like, and maybe even asking somebody like, \"Have you thought about that memory in the last 10 years even without the cue of the item?\" And I think that can be a way to get at whether or not they\\'re actually [INAUDIBLE 1:06:05] or if they\\'re difficulties with memory.

So the constructs that randy came up with are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness, overvalued ideation, so that would be more of a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items, or indifference. Um, and I'm wondering how you see these fitting together in people's insight. So, these are interesting to me because they are so varied. So, overvalued ideation or anosognosia even, sound almost more like a delusional disorder where you're looking at an item and you have an unreasonable belief that the item is more valuable than it is, or you're looking at your space and you think that your space looks normal, even though is objectively, you know no one with objectivity would see it as normal. Whereas defensiveness is much more based on behavior and indifference also is very behavioral and seems sort of like related to depression and just not caring about space. So, I guess what I'm getting at with this question is how do you think about these and do you see them all as equally relevant or do you feel like some are more central to insight as you understand it in hoarding disorder?\",\n",

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem.

So I think it sort of depends on… it can be dependent on the skill of the practitioner or it may also be dependent on the individual child and how difficult it is to them to deal with so. Yeah, but I think understanding that it is not going to solely an unpleasant experience both for the child and the parent. I think it is helpful. Although again, I think there has to be some realistic expectations, and I mean I guess it also depends on the CBT whether how much they are going to have an expectation that the parent is going to be involved. I think often… therapy is relatively limited and you are going to have to have more outside parental involvement. So I think that can be challenging for parents. It can be difficult to them to put their child in that situation. It is unpleasant for them. So um yeah… it goes against sort of your parental instincts. So I think that can be a challenge that kind of needs to be made clear to parents. That sometimes you are going to be asked or told to do things that are not what you would think, you know. Protecting your child is not always… the best way to move forward. I mean I guess the other thing is consistency…. And um yeah providing consistency because I think that’s important and I think that’s really hard, especially when you are dealing with two different parents. I don’t know.

It just so happened that it was an art collection, and when they died it was an extremely valuable art collection that they had accumulated over the course of like 60 years of living in New York city and it was all donated to the MET and valued at like $6 million, but prior to them dying nobody was able to view the art, nobody was able to enter the apartment, it was basically an unlivable space.

I think that doesn't mean that that's always the case, though I think that's where more research is needed in terms of the role of like a traumatic experience. I mean there's some cases where someone maybe wasn't struggling with those symptoms at all and then they're 35 or 40 and then something happened, like a trauma might happen or some sort of stressful life event, and then they develop difficulties with the acquisition and discarding and the disorder comes from that. I think that happens less than what I know about the research, however it does happen. And so that is interesting how for some people it starts kind of insidiously at a young age and then just kind of progressively becomes exasperated, but for others it might not even be there until later in life and maybe a hypothesis is maybe some sort of event, stressor, trauma basically triggers a disorder for some personal reason.

So, they may look at like a newspaper from 10 years ago the same as they would a brand new book. So, they don\\'t know what to discard, they have no starting point so when they start to think about discarding you can tell by body language that they\\'re having difficulty even deciding what item to pick up and then getting distressed when thinking about what to do with it. So, it\\'s not just about like, \"I\\'m gonna get rid of...in this table I\\'m gonna pick up all the garbage and throw the garbage away,\" but what is garbage and what isn\\'t garbage. So, I think that is a distress because when they try to make a decision, they just kind of shut down and they can\\'t make that decision. So, they have difficulty knowing where to start, and then the anxiety that they get. So, a lot of times they\\'ll do self-talk like, \"well I guess I could get rid of this,\" or \"I could use this for this\" or you know, they can\\'t really make that one decision quickly. They have to kind of go through the motions of what if. They always talk about what ifs, and I know they\\'re starting to get distressed when they\\'re thinking about all the possibilities. When they\\'re trying to make a decision it\\'s, \"what could go wrong.\" They start catastrophizing, you know, \"if I got rid of this item,\" kind of think about the worst possible thing that could happen, instead of just, \"I\\'m getting rid of it and then it\\'s out of my head.\" And then they will start to ruminate on the possibility that they made a mistake if they do make a decision, so that\\'s kind of how I measure distress.

Like your parents die and leave you a bunch of stuff, your children leave home and so you're now alone in the house, your marriage ends or your spouse dies and so you're more isolated? And do you as a clinician think that it's related to things like dementia, and therefore related to aging, and therefore that's why we see it as more prevalent in older adults?

Like do you keep stuff that other people would say, \"I\\'d rather have this space than this object in my life.\" And in terms of the paintings, how I would view that would depend on what else is in the home.

So, I sort of see that PCS model. I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding? Would the phenomenon even have roots, because it couldn't manifest in the same ways?

I think that's at the heart of it and I think the DSM does outline that. I think the one criteria I might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. I think that when we think about the internet and I already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? It might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the DSM doesn't really talk about. If an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the DSM doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, I mean I'm not sure what you would diagnose.

I have individuals with fears of something incriminating being on any paper material, and so they have to check it, or being worried about throwing out something valuable getting mixed in with the items they want to discard, so the checking rituals become prohibitory difficult. You know, somebody with obsessions around personal information and identity theft, who looks to all intensive purposes superficially like a hoarder because he accumulates everything that comes in the door, but it's really about his concern around identity theft and his having to check it meticulously to make sure he didn't somehow get a piece of mail mixed up with it or something that has his phone number or credit card number or any other information on it.

So, many people I see will say when they look back absolutely as it's been reported in other studies, you know they identified difficulty with discarding going back to their early adult years or teens or sometimes even late childhood, but the accumulation took time to get out of control and quite often I find hoarders that I see who are usually in their 40s to 60s, although I've seen some younger ones, will often say it got out of control because of environmental changes. Their spouse left them of their relationship ended or their children moved out or their aging parents downsized or died. And as a result they've been presented with even more stuff and it totally overwhelmed their ability and their limited ability to cope with it and to deal. At that point, they now recognize the problem. So, I think there's a bit of an artificiality in our saying it's more prevalent among the elderly, which is simply related to the objective reality, which is that it takes years for the accumulation in many cases to really reach that threshold of intolerance or impairment that's recognized by the individual.\",\n",

So, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it.

Or like maybe something would happen, you know, like I\\'ll need this and I\\'ll be in hard times again. And actually one of the, like an interesting case example is, I can\\'t remember his name, I think it was a Chinese artist who\\'s mother struggled with hoarding, one second I\\'m just gonna look up the name of it. Oh, Song Dong, and so she was an artist and he grew up in China and his mother basically there was just like economic difficulties in China as he was--or as she was growing up, and so she learned basically to save and to not waste because of those difficulties, just in case that were to happen again. Like it was just kind of a value that she learned because of what was happening in society and that was a big part of her difficulty. It was rooted in her experience as a child and not having what she needed. I\\'ve heard that form many patients and not everybody for sure, but definitely some and there was this idea that, \"I don\\'t want that to ever happen again or at least I want to do what I can to prevent that from happening if I ever were in a situation where I didn\\'t have what I needed.\" I don\\'t see that that often, but I have seen it a couple of times.',\n",

So, the first one is about value and when we talked about what distinguishes a person who has hoarding disorder from somebody who's a collector, you mentioned that the person with hoarding disorder their space will be much more kind of impacted and unusable, and I'm wondering if in your mind the value of the items saved is relevant to whether or not somebody has hoarding disorder? So, could you be a person with hoarding disorder who exclusively saves one kind of item in the same way a collector might?

So this was a young woman, maybe in her 30s, she had moved into her apartment maybe only 8 months earlier, so she hadn't lived there very long. It's a very small apartment, her kitchen and living room were kind of all together like in one area, and her bedroom was a separate room, and the photos of the kitchen itself, like the place where you would prepare food and store things did not look hoarded at all. It looked extremely functional in the kitchen, but once you stepped away from the counters, there were piles of things that were more disorganized, but she described the things as not being hers or being temporarily there. Like for example, there were some closet doors that she said belonged to the landlord. And I have a hard time knowing when somebody says that, that this object is temporarily there it just belongs to someone else, I have a hard time knowing how to evaluate that in the context of hoarding because people tell themselves stories about objects in their homes. About, oh yes this belongs to someone else, and they kind of...the fact that is has sat there for a while and it's actually going to sit there for the next five years is not part of the story that they tell themselves. So, I don't quite know how to evaluate it. The most problematic room was her bedroom, however, where the mattress was on the floor and there was no visible floor space in the entire length of the room and she described this situation as being due to the fact that in the previous apartment, her bed had been a loft and she hadn't yet been able to get a bed up on a loft because it takes 3 people to handle the loft. And that under the bed, once the loft was there, would be perfect storage space for all this stuff that was in her bedroom. The things in her bedroom included bikes and quite a large pile of pillows that was not actually on her bed, and the photos made it clear that she actually sleeps on a tiny part of the bed because the rest of the bed is covered with stuff. And so it, partly because the photo was of a bed on the floor, so like if your bed is up, like my bed is a couple feet above the floor, that means that if my possessions were at the height of the bed, that would be two and a half feet of debris. But her bed was on the floor, so it made it look a little fuller than it was. But it's still true that you couldn't walk in it, and she said she couldn't walk over to the other side of the bedroom, so I have a really hard time trying to sort out, especially because different areas of the home had different functional abilities. Like the bedroom looked pretty not functional, the kitchen looked perfectly functional. So yeah, that was a hard one for me.\",\n",

You know, and kind of talking to somebody to increase their insight would be something that we would do in therapy. But yeah, I think that on some level, most people that I see have some insight. The person that I worked with who had the least amount of insight, I think the reason the person was in treatment was because of the threat of evictions.

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem.

So I think it sort of depends on… it can be dependent on the skill of the practitioner or it may also be dependent on the individual child and how difficult it is to them to deal with so. Yeah, but I think understanding that it is not going to solely an unpleasant experience both for the child and the parent. I think it is helpful. Although again, I think there has to be some realistic expectations, and I mean I guess it also depends on the CBT whether how much they are going to have an expectation that the parent is going to be involved. I think often… therapy is relatively limited and you are going to have to have more outside parental involvement. So I think that can be challenging for parents. It can be difficult to them to put their child in that situation. It is unpleasant for them. So um yeah… it goes against sort of your parental instincts. So I think that can be a challenge that kind of needs to be made clear to parents. That sometimes you are going to be asked or told to do things that are not what you would think, you know. Protecting your child is not always… the best way to move forward. I mean I guess the other thing is consistency…. And um yeah providing consistency because I think that’s important and I think that’s really hard, especially when you are dealing with two different parents. I don’t know. I think that’s getting off topic… I think yeah it’s obviously very helpful to have parents understand what the processes as well as the child.

I think maybe the difference in hoarding disorder or anxiety disorder or OCD is that, at least from the folks I\\'ve seen, it\\'s not as fixed I guess. The overvalued ideation is there, but there\\'s like enough flexibility in most people to try things differently. Unless there\\'s like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn\\'t there and it\\'s just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there\\'s a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there\\'s no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there\\'s no approaching it in any way shape or form. Most people I\\'ve worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, \"Oh yeah, I can see that\\'s a strong value, I can see how I really think that I am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however I\\'m also seeing that if I do this this way, I\\'m never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, I\\'m never going to be able to do this if I do it 100% right all the time\" so maybe there\\'s some flexibility that\\'s incorporated, even though I still strongly believe that I want to be an environmentally conscious person and I want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that\\'s where I would see there\\'s like some flexibility and it\\'s not completely like, \"I have to do it this way and we\\'re not doing it any differently\" and I think that might be one piece that might help.',\n",

This is something he is saving for possible use in the future and that seems more of the mentality of a hoarder.\",\n",

       "  'Yeah, it was good for everybody.',\n",

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah I would love to read that, yeah. Okay I do have some thoughts about that. So, I think, I\\'ve thought a lot about overvalued ideation and the lack of an ability to perceive a problem, like just not seeing clutter as an issue or maybe not even being able to see the clutter, really or perceive that the space, to not be able to recognize the illness in that way I think that\\'s kind of what we were talking a little bit about with insight before, that an individual just might not be able to see that there\\'s a problem. And so I think that definitely comes up a lot, I\\'ve seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, I think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, I think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. I think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. I think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, I already kind of mentioned, \"There\\'s a specific way I have to discard of this item and it\\'s so important that I do this in a very specific way and if not I\\'m a bad person,\" for example. And that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn\\'t discard in a specific kind of way, they\\'re a bad person. So there\\'s this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don\\'t want to feel like a bad person. So I think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and I think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and OCD as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like \"My rituals are important, I need to do my checking because if not I might murder somebody and I don\\'t want to be responsible for that.\"',\n",

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

I think that definitely could be possible and I think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that I've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\",\n",

So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know. So, yeah I think I could probably count on two hands the number of patients out of the hundreds that I've worked with where the indifference was very strong.

We have a hoarded room in my lab, and it really does look like a hoarded room, and there's a different smell about that room. There's no squalor in the room but there's kind of that dusty cardboard sort of smell and if that's the smell that you've come to associate with the home, then that would be a comforting smell. And there's also a different acoustic in that room than in the room next door, which is perfectly empty.

Often, it's difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.

I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember.

And we also collect data, so there's data about the cases, but it's quite impoverished because there's no person attached to it. The other line of my research has to do with psychological functioning in hoarding, and there we actually have people who identify as having problems with hoarding come into our research lab and we give them a diagnostic interview and a bunch of testing. I directly listen to the diagnostic interviews, so I hear--I don't conduct them but I supervise them, so I hear quite a lot of stories from these recordings.

So, I think there's a lack of looking at the [INAUDIBLE 17:22] spaces with the diagnosis. So, I think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. And you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. I also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. Like in the area where I live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience.

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem.

The indifference is...I see far less I would say, at least as I understand Randy to have been talking about it, and I think I also would say about the first three that I see them as present at different levels and with fluctuation as I was saying earlier. So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know. So, yeah I think I could probably count on two hands the number of patients out of the hundreds that I've worked with where the indifference was very strong.

Toothpaste caps are not commonly accepted as a collectible, art is. Even weird little things like things that have ducks on them, are recognized. It might not be something that I would want to collect, but people collect them. And hoarding involves a collection of things that don't, like I could see a guy who collected these age-old vitamin bottles because...I mean they were empty, he had eaten the vitamins out of them, but they don't make them the same way anymore. They've changed the style of bottle for this vitamin, so he saw that as a collection but I didn't see that as a collection.

You know, a lot of my clients don't actually meet clinical diagnosis, or wouldn't meet a clinical diagnosis because they may live in a facility that has certain rules or certain guidelines, or they may live with their family members or have been working on their hoarding disorder for long periods of time, but they still have the emotional attachment to objects and they still have the anxiety and the difficulty discarding and trouble with organization, so they still have all of the trouble that goes along with the hoarding disorder, but their space may not meet the diagnosis. So, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it. So, they may still be suffering from the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but not actually meet a diagnosis. So, I will get clients like that often.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewee: Yeah, so one thing I often talk about with my patients is differentiating between the difficulty they have in the way they relate to stuff, and the legacy in the years of accumulation, and I think there's inadequate weight given to that distinction. So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. Sorry I'm trying to think now what your question was.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.',\n",
       " \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. I don't have a clear answer, I guess. It does come down to like a [INAUDIBLE 34:35] judgment on my part sometimes about whether it's getting in the way of their ability to function and their intended use. You're right, there can be gray zones.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewee: Yes, I think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis I actually did a memory [INAUDIBLE 47:57] and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there.',\n",
       " 'Interviewee: Yes, so you will see certainly when you come into some of these places and again there’s a range of things, so sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes what you see is tons and tons of old pet food, bags of dog food, bags of cat food, empty cans of cat food, empty cans of dog food, you know litter bags, etc. So some of it is the (INAUDIBLE 37:08) of having animals and I don’t know that they’re hoarding that, they just don’t throw it away and that’s just how their lives are organized.',\n",
       " \"Interviewee: Yes, yeah that also is something...like I have clients who will only hoard brand-new item, like electronics, but they have the same feelings towards these objects even though they haven't used them, they have no immediate use for it, it's cluttering up you know. They can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so I think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. So, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. I think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working [INAUDIBLE 21:25] what they think is valuable or not.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewee: You know because it--well, I come across people who are very poor and they\\'re saving things to sell and they\\'re not saving the same kinds of things. And actually they actually do sell them, unlike someone with hoarding who might say, \"oh I intend to sell them\" but nothing ever proceeds. And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I\\'ve seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn\\'t hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row. So it doesn\\'t look like intentionally saved containers, like somebody might wash out their containers and might have 150 of them.
