What tells them they won\\'t remember? Are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember.

And we also collect data, so there's data about the cases, but it's quite impoverished because there's no person attached to it. The other line of my research has to do with psychological functioning in hoarding, and there we actually have people who identify as having problems with hoarding come into our research lab and we give them a diagnostic interview and a bunch of testing. I directly listen to the diagnostic interviews, so I hear--I don't conduct them but I supervise them, so I hear quite a lot of stories from these recordings.

So, I think there's a lack of looking at the [INAUDIBLE 17:22] spaces with the diagnosis. So, I think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. And you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. I also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. Like in the area where I live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience.

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem.

       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, I think you’re exactly right that the presence of clutter and the severity of clutter is influenced by a whole bunch of things that are completely external to the person’s psychopathology and for that reason (INAUDIBLE, 36:36) sort of hoarding special interest groups at the foundation and our little research conferences.',\n",

You know, a lot of my clients don't actually meet clinical diagnosis, or wouldn't meet a clinical diagnosis because they may live in a facility that has certain rules or certain guidelines, or they may live with their family members or have been working on their hoarding disorder for long periods of time, but they still have the emotional attachment to objects and they still have the anxiety and the difficulty discarding and trouble with organization, so they still have all of the trouble that goes along with the hoarding disorder, but their space may not meet the diagnosis. So, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it. So, they may still be suffering from the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but not actually meet a diagnosis. So, I will get clients like that often.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, so one thing I often talk about with my patients is differentiating between the difficulty they have in the way they relate to stuff, and the legacy in the years of accumulation, and I think there's inadequate weight given to that distinction. So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. Sorry I'm trying to think now what your question was.\",\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. I don't have a clear answer, I guess. It does come down to like a [INAUDIBLE 34:35] judgment on my part sometimes about whether it's getting in the way of their ability to function and their intended use. You're right, there can be gray zones.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yes, I think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis I actually did a memory [INAUDIBLE 47:57] and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there.',\n",
       "  'Interviewee: Yes, so you will see certainly when you come into some of these places and again there’s a range of things, so sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes what you see is tons and tons of old pet food, bags of dog food, bags of cat food, empty cans of cat food, empty cans of dog food, you know litter bags, etc. So some of it is the (INAUDIBLE 37:08) of having animals and I don’t know that they’re hoarding that, they just don’t throw it away and that’s just how their lives are organized.',\n",
       "  \"Interviewee: Yes, yeah that also is something...like I have clients who will only hoard brand-new item, like electronics, but they have the same feelings towards these objects even though they haven't used them, they have no immediate use for it, it's cluttering up you know. They can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so I think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. So, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. I think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working [INAUDIBLE 21:25] what they think is valuable or not.\",\n",
       "  'Interviewee: You know because it--well, I come across people who are very poor and they\\'re saving things to sell and they\\'re not saving the same kinds of things. And actually they actually do sell them, unlike someone with hoarding who might say, \"oh I intend to sell them\" but nothing ever proceeds. And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I\\'ve seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn\\'t hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row. So it doesn\\'t look like intentionally saved containers, like somebody might wash out their containers and might have 150 of them.

       "  'Interviewee: Yup and that was a big debate and that’s where there were (INAUDIBLE, 47:10) and I disagreed because they were kind of writing the criteria and I think even one of their own rating scales, hoarding rating scales, that kind of implies that everybody with hoarding disorder has poor insight and doesn’t want to discard.',\n",

       "  'Interviewee: I was working really closely with [NAME 29:26] when the criteria was developed for field trial actually. So, the first thing that comes to mind, which has been a longstanding conversation, is the distress or impairment in functioning criteria, so that \"or\" is an interesting one there. And of course reflects the egosyntonic vs egodystonic nature of hoarding and all of the controversy that kind of comes up around that, and I think in some ways we put that discussion to bed, but in other ways I think it\\'s really still quite a central question. Not so much is a disorder a disorder if it is egosyntonic, but what does it mean when it is egosyntonic in terms of things like insight and motivation for treatment? So that\\'s one piece, I think another piece that\\'s really interesting to me, and has been since the time of sort of looking at that criteria, is acquisition as a specifier and I\\'m thinking more broadly about the relationship to compulsive buying sort of the works that [NAME 30:47] is doing and the models of compulsive buying and how we understand. Certainly buying is only one form of acquisition, but what the interrelationship is between those two things, especially given the impulse-control problem that is inherent in acquisition that is different in other elements of hoarding behavior. We don\\'t see quite that same impulse-control problem, or at least manifesting in the same way. And then the third thing that I would say is this differential piece between, that the hoarding is better accounted for by other medical or mental health, you know physical or mental health problems and I think, you know, dementia is a whole place, brain injury is a whole place where actually doing the differential diagnosis to understand what the driver is is really complicated, and I don\\'t think the structured energy for hoarding disorder as it currently stands or any of our other assessments, they weren\\'t developed to help us make those differentials.

       "  \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",

But I hear it a lot as just like a reason for keeping something, that \"if I don\\'t have this reminder, this cue, I won\\'t remember.\" And I think I tend to challenge that in therapy, because I tend to ask people to test that out for themselves like are they sure they won\\'t remember? What tells them they won\\'t remember? Are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? I think it\\'s almost like this fear that they\\'ll forget, it\\'s like this fear of forgetting, like if I don\\'t have this cue then I won\\'t remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we\\'re doing exposures, for example, they\\'ll come across things they haven\\'t seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they\\'re not actually using the items that are a cue to remember. So I might reflect that as well, like it sounds like, and maybe even asking somebody like, \"Have you thought about that memory in the last 10 years even without the cue of the item?\" And I think that can be a way to get at whether or not they\\'re actually [INAUDIBLE 1:06:05] or if they\\'re difficulties with memory.

And we also collect data, so there's data about the cases, but it's quite impoverished because there's no person attached to it. The other line of my research has to do with psychological functioning in hoarding, and there we actually have people who identify as having problems with hoarding come into our research lab and we give them a diagnostic interview and a bunch of testing. I directly listen to the diagnostic interviews, so I hear--I don't conduct them but I supervise them, so I hear quite a lot of stories from these recordings. And finally I supervise a [INAUDIBLE 17:13] doing group [INAUDIBLE 17:16] for hoarding.

So, I think there's a lack of looking at the [INAUDIBLE 17:22] spaces with the diagnosis. So, I think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. And you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. I also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. Like in the area where I live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience. So, clients can't see somebody that can diagnose them with something because of the lack of experience with professionals. I have no idea if I answered your whole question [laughs].\",\n",

And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem.

So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know.

It might not be something that I would want to collect, but people collect them. And hoarding involves a collection of things that don't, like I could see a guy who collected these age-old vitamin bottles because...I mean they were empty, he had eaten the vitamins out of them, but they don't make them the same way anymore. They've changed the style of bottle for this vitamin, so he saw that as a collection but I didn't see that as a collection.

So, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it. So, they may still be suffering from the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but not actually meet a diagnosis. So, I will get clients like that often.\",\n",

So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. Sorry I'm trying to think now what your question was.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.',\n",

They can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so I think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. So, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. I think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working [INAUDIBLE 21:25] what they think is valuable or not.\",\n",

And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I\\'ve seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn\\'t hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row.
