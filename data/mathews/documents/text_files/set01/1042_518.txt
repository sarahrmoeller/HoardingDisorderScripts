Do I know somebody who's gotten better? Just a few friends and family that I've felt have gotten a bit better at their hoarding goals stuff. I'm not sure. It actually helps someone else and in helping someone else, it helps me. That was the only thing that helped me, because I would be able to see, "Oh, look what she did. She gathered like 55 oil paintings and then she had nowhere to put them, and she put them in her shed. She asked me to help her clean out the shed and I went, 'Uh-oh.'" When you help someone else put the trust into collecting, gathering, you say, "Oh, wait a minute, I do the same thing. Maybe I need some help." It's helpful and you can see the difference only when you see somebody with a worse problem.
Interviewer:
How would you... Sorry, what?
Participant 042:
That's the only time I can see the difference.
Interviewer:
What would you say hoarding disorder looks like?
Participant 042:
Similar to your question earlier, except... Let me think. It doesn't mean that it's just appearance related, because it's on the inside to. It's like an emotional. I know what it is. It's an emotional... This one lady told me that with her it was purely emotional. She just had to have it. She just had to have several antiques. I don't have pure emotions about several antiques, but I have... I think it's inside the person and I think it's in me too, trying to show up something and they're trying to have several things, because there's a scarcity, for lack of a better word, there's a feeling of scarcity. Oh, no, I don't have this so therefore I better have three or four or five this go.
Interviewer:
Kind of going back, this is similar to the question that i asked for, and this next one is going to be too to see if you had time to think about it, is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant 042:
I don't know. I think probably no, probably not, because it's easy to sort of hide your extra stuff I think if you're not a person carrying things about. I used to carry a little, not too much with me. I still do that though, but yeah, I always think I'm going to get stuck somewhere that I need at least two things to read. Yeah, I think the answer is probably pretty much no. You can't guess, because it's their stuff, without it.
Interviewer:
It seems like you kind of know a little bit about hoarding disorder. Where have you gotten information about it from?
