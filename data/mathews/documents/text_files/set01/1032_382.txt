Interviewee32:
Hmm. Well, that's hard for me to say because I do have a couple or a few collections myself.
But I have worked really hard to not go overboard, what I consider overboard, and there's no cut and dry number of objects in a collection that is the limit to what's normal and what's hoarding.
So, that's...
It depends on so many factors, how much space you have, and how much money you have, and how much tolerance for...
Anyway, I don't know.
So, it seems to me that if one has more of a certain object in a collection that can comfortably and aesthetically fit into whatever container or display case or whatever it is that one has set up for it, then one could consider it to be a hoarding situation.
If you've got overflow or just everything's packed in so tight you can't even see what all the objects are, and they're spilling over or you have boxes of whatever that object is that you never could unpack because there's no room for it, that's going too far.
Interviewer:
Okay, perfect.
So, it's all about going back to that idea of everything having its place and not overflowing or seeming overly stuffed in there.
Interviewee32:
Yeah, that's my sensibility about it.
Interviewer:
Okay, and is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Interviewee32:
Hmm.
Hmm, that's a really good question.
I suppose if it's...
It depends.
If it's a long-term relationship, you know this person, you've had many conversations with the person, if you notice this person talking about acquiring another blah, blah, blah whatever this thing is, but you know that they already have acquired and... I don't know, I'm not real clear on how to articulate this but I think through conversation one could get an idea that somebody is a hoarder from what they say, what they talk about, and or how they describe their home situation.
Interviewer:
Okay, so just like conversationally you may be able to pick up on it?
Interviewee32:
Yeah, I think so.
Interviewer:
Okay, and where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
I know that you said you read books about decluttering but have you read books on the disorder itself or have you watched any TV shows or anything like that?
Interviewee32:
I haven't read books about hoarding.
I have seen a couple of those...
The great shows like... I don't know if it's Oprah or who but over the last couple of decades I've seen once or twice only shows that just blew my mind how a person can...
It makes me feel like my problem is no problem.
Interviewer:
Okay, so it kind of puts things into perspective like that it could be worse?
Interviewee32:
Oh, yeah.
Oh my goodness, yes, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
