Interviewee:
Inside I'm a very organized person.
My thought patterns.
Everything is, is about organization.
But when I look at it, I can't, I can’t bring that over to doing it.
Does that make sense?
Interviewer: Mhmm.
It does, yeah.
Interviewee:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: So, for you, you kind of feel like even though you know you want to be an organized person, and I know you would like to be an organized person and have some to have some organization, but it's hard to, you know, battle between your thoughts and you know, what you are actually doing.
Right?
Interviewee:
Right, right.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, have you ever in your life, tried to seek some professional help for hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
You know, I have not.
I’ve thought about it, you know?
But I’ve gone for help for mental issues, you know?
Depression issues.
Interviewer: Okay.
And, do you think that's tied to the hoarding at all?
Interviewee:
Um… yeah, I would think it is because, um, why else would I be so depressed when I look at it?
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee:
You know?
Interviewer: And, definitely I know for some people, the keeping the things kind of gives you some sort of satisfaction, right?
Or, you know, makes you feel a little whole.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
It's like, um… for me it’s such a beauty, especially my cups and saucers and my roses and things.
Every year, I go to [name of place; ], they have that cup display.
and I bring my stuff to show.
Interviewer: Right, okay.
Interviewee:
So, it's Judy and it's something to talk to people about.
Interviewer: Okay, so keeping your stuff kind of gives you an opportunity to talk to other people, you know, and find people who have similar interest to you then.
Interviewee:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, for you, would you say that, you know your collections have almost—
Interviewee:
I’m sorry, I have to shut the door.
Interviewer: Oh no, no worries.
Would you say your collections have almost given you like social opportunities before?
Interviewee:
Oh Lord, yeah.
When I go, it’s in January.
People just come up and talk and everything.
I had one lady, this other little issue that may have been hoarding, is she gave me a box of cups and saucers that had belonged to her grandmother.
And I was not gonna turn those down.
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee:
Yeah, because they were all pristine condition.
Beautiful stuff.
So, they’re up in my, um, laundry room.
Interviewer: So, you definitely find it difficult then to turn things down, especially if you can see the beauty of the value in them?
Interviewee:
Right.
