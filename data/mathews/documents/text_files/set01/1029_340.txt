Interviewer:
Start the recording. ... And do you have any last minute questions before we jump into the interview?
Participant 29:
Not that come to mind. But thank you for asking.
Interviewer:
Okay. Well we can go ahead and start then, if you're comfortable?
Participant 29:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So as I mentioned before, this study is investigating attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.
But the first question I want to ask you is what term you prefer when we're talking about difficulties with clutter, and difficulties discarding?
Participant 29:
You're asking me what term? Say that again please. I'm sorry.
Interviewer:
What term you would prefer when we're referring to difficulties with clutter and difficulties with discarding items?
Participant 29:
Oh, I don't really care. If you're using hoarding, it's fine with me. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 29:
I don't find it offensive, is that what you're concerned about?
Interviewer:
Yeah. We just want to make sure you're comfortable.
Participant 29:
Absolutely.
Interviewer:
Okay, so the next section of the interview that we'll be moving onto is a series of questions. And so this is more like a conversation between us, rather than me asking you to give me lists of items.
Participant 29:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So we'll first talk about behavior and treatment seeking, and how we can get into this is, would you mind describing your problems with clutter and how long this has been going on for you?
Participant 29:
It's been going on about 20 years, and I'm 73 now. That's around the time when my parents died, and I brought so much stuff into my home from their home. So it's somewhere in that range of 20 years. 
Interviewer:
Okay, and what does your hoarding disorder look like right now?
Participant 29:
Well my desktop is covered. Is that the kind of answer you're looking for?
Interviewer:
Yeah. 
Participant 29:
Yeah, my desktop is covered with things. Sometimes I get really lucky and I have it all nice and neat, and orderly. But it doesn't take a lot to get too much stuff on the desk. There's a couple of boxes on the floor because I don't have room for everything. But, I have a big counter behind me. I do buy all these different sorting devices, I make attempts to try to figure out how to use organizing types of things. And, it just doesn't last very long. There's all these different categories, and then I end up putting stuff where it shouldn't have been, or I'll get a new pile of paper in. I need to move it out of the living area of my home. So it'll come in here and that'll be another pile.
