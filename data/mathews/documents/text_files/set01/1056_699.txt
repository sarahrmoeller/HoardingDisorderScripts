Interviewer: Okay. So, when you know, maybe if you were in college and you were living in a smaller space, or if you ever lived in an apartment, for example, um, and you had less space, how would you organize your stuff so that it never infringed on using your space or having people over?
Participant:
It wasn’t an issue because I didn’t have stuff accumulated at that point in time. Hadn’t been alive long enough to accumulate stuff.
Interviewer: Right. So, can you remember when you first kinda noticed that you had been accumulating stuff? Was there ever a point when you realized you did have a lot of stuff?
Participant:
Um… I think it was just a gradual thing. As my available space expanded, rather than discarding things that didn’t have an immediate use but might have a potential use, I just held onto it instead.
Interviewer: Okay.
Participant:
So, no particular time that I would identify.
Interviewer: And, there was no time where maybe you accumulated a lot of stuff all at once from some sort of event? I know you mentioned earlier that if you had a relative pass that maybe you would accumulate—
Participant:
I would say that I added a large number of boxes of stuff and photos and things like that upon a death of a relative, but that would be the only time that there was an acute accumulation.
Interviewer: Right. And otherwise it’s been more like, gradually as you like, accumulated stuff from life in general.
Participant:
Yeah. If I need something and hmm, I don’t need it anymore, then instead of it going in the garbage it might go in the back room because someone might need it.
Interviewer: So, we talked a lot about how your significant other was definitely, not always okay with um, the keeping of the stuff. But, has it ever impacted things other than your family and romantic relationships? Like has it ever impacted your work life?
Participant:
Nope.
Interviewer: Never, okay. SO how about, you know, your family as in your immediate family like your mother, your father, your siblings, have they ever had a problem with it?
Participant:
Um, not that they’ve mentioned.
Interviewer: Okay. So, are they aware that you keep stuff?
Participant:
They know what it looks like here.
Interviewer: Right. And, how about anyone like a landlord or any sort of professional relationship like that? Ever impacted one of those?
Participant:
Nope.
Interviewer: Okay, so, I just have a few more questions then and we can start wrapping up soon. But um, to kinda finish off, would you ever like to change this behavior? And if so, or if not, why?
