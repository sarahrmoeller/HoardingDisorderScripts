Interviewer:
Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. So next question is, what do you think the most precious item in your house is?
Interviewee:
Oh god. My bird. My live bird. I mean, my precious ... because all the fires we've had here in the Bay Area. I've watched people and they left their pets behind. I freaked out. It's like, how can you leave your pets?
Interviewer:
Yeah. I know.
Interviewee:
Probably because they were at work or something and they told them to evacuate and couldn't get back. But my pets and then pictures, I guess photographs, I'd probably grab a box of photographs of my mom and dad who are dead and something like that. That's all I can think of. I mean, I have insurance so all of this stuff can be replaced.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. Okay. Thank you. Do you think you have too much stuff?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Let me see here. Okay. If you had to choose between any of your items, we kind of talked about this, how would you choose a certain item over the other one?
Interviewee:
Well, whether I used it or not.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Whether I used it or whether I intended to use it which is why I've got so much stuff it's just like well, I can use that. But see, I lost my job. This has nothing to do, but I lost my job through this COVID thing and I'm trying to find another job and the last thing I want to do right now is clean. Now other people, they're baking, they're doing gardening. No. I'm kind of more focused on finding a job. Once I know I've got a job, I can relax and the rest of my life fall into place. But I've had some difficult times as I've gotten older and it depresses me. When I'm depressed, that's the last thing I want to do is clean. There's no way.
Interviewer:
I understand. Yeah. Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. All right. Let me see here. Does your behavior upset you in any way? Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Interviewee:
Yeah. I mean, when it gets in the way ... I mean, when it gets in the way I clean it up. And I have it situated so that it isn't in my way. But for instance I'll give you an example. I take The New Yorker. Okay, that's a weekly magazine. There is absolutely no way you can get through it in a week. And it piles up and piles up and everybody who takes The New Yorker knows that. If the subscription is just and I'm sitting here, I haven't even read half of them. They're all over place. And it's like I've done this before and it's like I don't read them but I really want to read them because it's the best read stuff. So that's something that I've got all over my house. New Yorkers, everywhere.
