Interviewer:
When you think about the stuff that you have, do you think that it's valuable?
Do you think that the items in your home are valuable?
And how do you determine which of those are the most valuable?
Participant 50:
I think that they are valuable.
I think that like that Marie whatever thing, I think it's the stuff that brings me the most joy and the stuff that I have really, really wanted to get that I had been waiting a while to get.
Because of the fact that I still don't know, I've been jet in life that it's sort of I need instant gratification because waiting around a little stuck for things to get started that's not so.
And I just had a sticky moment.
Tell me the question.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I was kind of wondering if you think that the things that you have are valuable and which things you value the most of the things you have.
Participant 50:
Okay.
Yeah.
So I think the things that I do have a valuable, because when I shop, I do shop for value and I buy things that I really like not because they're on sale, but also I try to say, if I'll have a use for it, I'll but.
Or something like a clothes something, I have an idea of where I'm going to wear it, when I'm going to wear.
How many pairs of pants it'll go with and stuff like that.
And if I can only wear it with one thing or whatever, I don't think I'll ever have a chance to wear it, then I don't get it.
and then as far as.
Interviewer:
So maybe one way of thinking about this is what do you think is the most valuable or precious thing that you have in your house?
And this can be precious to you or it can be objectively.
Totally depends on you, how you would like to answer that question.
Participant 50:
I think the most valuable thing that I have in that house is myself.
Everything else can be replaced if I have the money to replace it.
Interviewer:
That's a great answer.
When you're going through your stuff, how do you decide when it's time to get rid of something?
