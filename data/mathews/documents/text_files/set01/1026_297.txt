Interviewer:
So you've dealt with it mainly by stopping yourself from getting new items?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
And that's been successful for you but you still just don't feel ready to go through the stuff that you have because it's such a big task.
Interviewee:
Yeah, right.
Interviewer:
Does that sound right?
Interviewee:
Right, right.
Now the important thing to remember is that I could easily get rid of 90% of that stuff and forget about it the next day but it's taking that step to do it that's very difficult for me.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like you're aware that you wouldn't necessarily miss it once it was gone?
Interviewee:
Oh right, yeah.
I mean the kids toys in the basement.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Sure, but I also understand that once you look at those things you feel the sentiment that's attached to them, and it becomes hard to just get rid of them even though you know that you're not using them.
Interviewee:
Right, right.
Now in the past I have been able to get rid of a lot of their things knowing that they were going to good causes.
Interviewer:
So it helps you to get rid of them when you know that they're going somewhere where they'll be used?
Interviewee:
Right.
And my husband says, "Just put everything in boxes and I'll drive them to Goodwill."
And I'm like, "Well I don't know if they're really going to be able to use it, and I want to find someone who really needs them."
Interviewer:
Yeah, so you're kind of waiting, or you feel like you would feel better about it if you knew for a fact that it was the right place for those items?
Interviewee:
Exactly, exactly.
Interviewer:
Let's talk about what it's like now, do you feel like it is a problem for you?
What is your home like and does it bother you to have these items?
Interviewee:
Yeah, there are still pockets of clutter and that bothers me, but I keep thinking down the road I'll just commit half an hour a day and I'll go through with it.
Sometimes I've done that, but right now there are other things I'm working on.
But the decluttering is on the back burner.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like you have made some attempts in the past to get rid of your clutter but right now it's not your priority?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
Had you ever gone to a professional to help you organize or to help you to kind of come to terms with your clutter?
Interviewee:
No, I don't like people touching my stuff.
Interviewer:
I understand that, yeah.
Interviewee:
Or making judgements, I know what I have to do, I just need to take that step.
