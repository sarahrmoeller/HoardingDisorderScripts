What about, any other of your relationships family-wise?
I know you said your parents didn't really know about it, but what about other relationships has that affected?
Besides maybe your roommate?
Interviewee48:
My romantic relationships are stilted and definitely affected by the fact that I spend time at their places.
They don't spend any time at mine.
That can be, that has been an issue in various relationships.

Do they know?
Do they know about the behavior?
When you say, "No, let's go to your place."
Interviewee48:
I express that it's a small space, and that we respect each other's privacy by not having company.
Interviewer:
What about work?
Interviewee48:
I don't tell them that I've got piles and mountains of stuff.
Work hasn't been affected at all.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well, that concludes our kind of discussion portion of the interview.
