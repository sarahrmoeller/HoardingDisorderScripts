What about, any other of your relationships family-wise?
I know you said your parents didn't really know about it, but what about other relationships has that affected?
Besides maybe your roommate?
Participant 48:
My romantic relationships are stilted and definitely affected by the fact that I spend time at their places.
They don't spend any time at mine.
That can be, that has been an issue in various relationships.
Interviewer:
Do they know?
Do they know about the behavior?
When you say, "No, let's go to your place."
Participant 48:
I express that it's a small space, and that we respect each other's privacy by not having company.
Interviewer:
What about work?
Participant 48:
I don't tell them that I've got piles and mountains of stuff.
Work hasn't been affected at all.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well, that concludes our kind of discussion portion of the interview.
