Participant:
Um yeah i think i think about the path from the door to the chair and from the chair to the TV and from the TV to the bathroom because that’s how my grandma lives. And so, I think worst-case scenario.
Interviewer:
Okay. And so, finally we're entering our last section which is on distress or interference, um, does your hoarding disorder upset you like do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant:
Not daily. But I think that it’s something that I focus or I think about weekly. You know? Like my five, get rid of five things and right now we’re talking and looking at these two big boxes on this one. Books in front of books. I recently lost a lot of weight and didn’t really notice that I had all this weight and it was. And now that I don't have this weight and my clothes are really loose like gosh how I didn't even realize. That all myself. Fill this thing up.  And so, now that it's gone. I see how much space right and so I feel like these books are there, they just kind of there like my hips and if I don't think about them they’re just going to stay there. So if I start moving them
Interviewer:
You’ll realize
Participant:
Yeah there’ll be more space. I can ignore it really easily and look away from it. But if I do look at it, it causes me a problem or is a problem.
Interviewer:
And, Could you describe a time when you're hoarding disorder in the way of something you really wanted?
Participant:
How ‘bout it this? I was, we were going to go visit family and I wanted to take some pictures of our house so I could show, you know, show off where we live to our family who hadn’t seen it. So, I was walking around with the iPad looking at the pictures, looking at the scene I was going to take and thinking “Oh, I don't want, I don't want them to see that.” So, you know, rather than just going into each room and snapping a picture which were taken five minutes it was hours. You know, moving the things here. So, I could have seen the great and then turning it in the other direction then I move it so that that scene looked good. Then in the kitchen, moving all of this over here. Moving it all in the other direction. So, its something that should have taken only; it shouldn’t have needed any thought. It took ages and ages because I would be embarrassed for them to see the pictures of it as we lived.
Interviewer:
I understand. Okay. Thank you so much. Um, and our last question is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?
