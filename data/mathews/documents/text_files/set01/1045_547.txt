Participant 45:
See the problem is I actually don't have to get rid of things.
I just keep sticking them into another box.
So I don't do very much of that and that's a muscle I need to work on.
But I am working to get a box ready to donate and I'm trying to cull through ... I see it like an onion where you take a easy, the first layer off.
It's like low hanging fruit and then I'm trying to keep going through again and again.
Some people say if you haven't used something in six months.
I guess I would say six years isn't even long enough for me but if you haven't used something for 20 years and you don't like it, maybe then it could go and then it almost always has to go to a landfill because nobody else would value it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 45:
But I do have a box here I'm putting things in.
I found some glass thing my mother had in her bathroom just recently and I took one look at it and I didn't like it and I thought, "No, they will like this at Salvation Army.
They'll be able to sell it to some other person that likes a thing like this because there's not a chip in it.
It's in perfect condition and that, I can put in the box, finally".
That's a breakthrough for me.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That's good.
So do you think that you have too much stuff?
Participant 45:
Without a doubt.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How do you know?
How do you know when you just have too much, when it's time to maybe try to get rid of something?
Participant 45:
Well, my goal is ... in fact I had my upstairs ... I have a reverse plan house.
So I have a living room, dining room, kitchen, upstairs.
And I had the living room, dining room, which are open to each other, cleared out enough so the book club could come here a couple, a few, three times.
But then I started doing some remodeling in the kitchen and it's now terrible.
The book club couldn't possibly come here.
