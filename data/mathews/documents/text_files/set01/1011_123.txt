Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah.
I understand.
Interviewee:
I'm going to go out and pick some plums today and see if I can give them to the family down the road at the Good Samaritan.
I'm trying to break my isolation so doing the best I can.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Has COVID affected your motivation to seek help for clutter, or have you ever seek help for hoarding before?
Interviewee:
No, I've never seeked help for hoarding other than I have some in the family take some things away that they want.
Like I mentioned, I'm trying to get that more and more so now.
And COVID's actually kept the family from coming and visiting me so yeah, that's been a detriment.
I can't get the family to visit me either because they can't get out of where they are, the weather's been so bad, now we got fires out here that are burning everything up, and the roads are closed.
Oh my goodness.
One thing after the other.
No, it's been difficult and I imagine it's going to be difficult for a while.
So hold your horses as my dad used to say.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So that's actually the end of the interview.
So thank you for completing this interview with me.
Interviewee:
Yeah, I'm interested.
What is the COVID part of this?
How does that fit into the research?
Interviewer:
It's just to see if there's any new information or new data we can collect from pre-COVID and during COVID just to see how COVID affects the data.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I don't think it's going to affect us hoarders that much because I think a lot of hoarders would feel comfortable in their hoarding stuff around them, like I mentioned earlier.
I don't feel that comfortable but a lot of hoarders do.
Some hoarders may even be more hoarding after the COVID.
So it'll be interesting to see how that affects hoarding people.
Interviewer:
Yeah, definitely.
Interviewee:
It may make them worse.
So if you can get some data in there to qualify, that would really be interesting.
Is there any chance I can ever get to see the results of these surveys?
Interviewer:
Yeah, actually.
So at the end, I can let Interviewer know.
She can send you data once it's all completed and we're able to send out the data.
So yeah, I'll let her know that for you.
Interviewee:
And another thing, they mentioned that they were going to pay me for this.
Well, I wasn't real enthused about that to begin with, but if they do, could they just add that to the gift card they gave me previously?
