Interviewee:
Okay. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving habits, just collecting, and hoarding?
Interviewee:
Well, collecting, you're able to choose what's ...
In my mind, choose what's valuable and keep that and let go of other things.
I think of folks who collect rocks and they go to rock shows and they buy and sell.
My dad, it was with birding equipment and telescopes and stuff.
He didn't hang on and collect them all and not get rid of them.
He traded, moved, gave away, whatever.
Just had the ones that he specifically needed for a particular time.
Same with rock collecting or any of the others.
You hang onto the ones you want and trade out the ones you don't want.
But hoarding, you just keep it all.
Valuable or not.
Interviewee:
All right.
What does hoarding look like?
How is it the same or different from your behavior?
Interviewee:
Well, fortunately, I feel like I don't have a very bad issue with it because I can still walk around the house but hoarding, yeah, I just picture the stories you hear where it's so bad that it's physically dangerous.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Interviewee:
I guess whether or not ...
If they talk about always needing to get or have or you see them taking things that you know they really don't need, however, you see them, in conversation.
At work, we can see a couple of folks who just would take things ...
Not steal but ... I work at a church.
Things that may be donated, they would hang onto them, whether they needed it or not or just take excess amounts whether they need it or not.
I guess there are signs but not always.
Interviewee:
Okay.
You mentioned previously about stories you hear.
Where have you gotten information about hoarding disorder?
What have you heard about it?
Interviewee:
You hear things on the news about people either dying and couldn't get into the house or you hear reports about things like that.
That, of course, is a common theme in various TV shows, which they exaggerate everything but I guess mainly the real things would be the news reports when someone is discovered as being a hoarder.
Interviewee:
Okay.
You don't personally seek out any information?
You just hear it when it comes on the news?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Okay.
What do you think about, specifically, when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
You know, just basically, somebody who just plain cannot get rid of stuff.
Yeah.
