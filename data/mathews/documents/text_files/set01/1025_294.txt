Interviewer:
I can imagine.
This has been very, very different than what we're used to.
Participant 25:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
What have you been doing to cope with the more depressed mood and the isolation?
Participant 25:
Well we talk, I talk to my husband and I have my good and bad days.
Maybe I sleep more than I should.
I read the bible and pray.
I mean that's probably the biggest thing that helps me cope.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 25:
I know that God is in control, so I rely on my faith more than anything to get me through the dark days.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Do you feel it's been helping so far?
Participant 25:
Yeah it does when I do it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
It is hard-
Participant 25:
It's an escape, so I like to sleep.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
You've mentioned your faith bringing your comfort.
Have the items that you have also helped bring comfort, or is primarily your loved ones, so having your husband around?
Participant 25:
It's probably all of it.
It's nice to have, I mean we have everything we need here.
We just basically have to buy groceries but everything else, we have what we need.
It's not like I'm living in a shack that doesn't have running water or anything.
I have everything I need in my house, so that is comforting.
Interviewer:
Exactly.
That kind of ties back to, that was something you mentioned in the first place, was whenever you have the items you always know that you have that security, that if you need something it's there, so why would you discard it in that place.
Participant 25:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Have you sought any professional help during this time?
Participant 25:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you ever felt that you needed that?
Participant 25:
Say that again.
Interviewer:
Have you ever felt that you needed professional-
Participant 25:
No, nope.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Looking through these questions.
Did you feel any sort of this social isolation or loneliness prior to the quarantine?
Participant 25:
No, because I could go out and be around people at will.
Interviewer:
Yes, which is something hopefully we'll get back to in the next year.
Participant 25:
Yeah, without a mask hopefully.
Interviewer:
You don't like seeing everyone's eyes?
Participant 25:
We all look like bank robbers.
Interviewer:
A little bit, yes.
Participant 25:
You can't smile at someone.
I mean facial expressions tell you a lot.
Interviewer:
Yeah, they do.
Participant 25:
CROSSTALK our facial expression.
You can't read people.
Interviewer:
It's made interacting, even when you do get the chance, it's just very different and it feels sterile in a way, almost.
Participant 25:
Yeah it is, ridiculous.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Have you experienced any conflict during quarantine, like with being home more?
Have your items affected your relationship with your husband?
