Interviewer:
And also if you would like me to...
Any of those numbers at any point, feel free to ask.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
All right.
So as you know the study is investigating individuals, attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.
The first question would be what term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Interviewee:
What term I prefer other than hoarding, is that what you're?
Interviewer:
So if you wouldn't like us to refer to it as hoarding, would you like it to be considered collecting or difficulties with clutter or anything like that?
Interviewee:
Hoarding is okay.
It's not offensive, but probably I consider it clutter more so.
Interviewer:
Okay.
All right.
And then the first part of the interview is just some basic demographic questions.
So what was your sex assigned at birth?
Interviewee:
Female.21qw
Interviewer:
All right.
And what gender do you identify as?
Interviewee:
Female.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And your racial identification?
Interviewee:
White or Caucasian.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Are you Hispanic or Latino?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
And then what is your highest degree or level of school you've completed.
Interviewee:
12th grade high school.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And then what is your household income?
And it can be in range.
It does not have to be exact.
Interviewee:
Right now.
It's not much with this COVID stuff, but it was about, I'd say 75,000.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And then what is your geographic region that best describes where you live in the US, so Northeast, Midwest, South or West?
Interviewee:
I guess it's considered Midwest.
Interviewer:
Okay.
All right.
So the next part of the interview is going to consist of what we call free listing prompts.
So the basic idea is that I'm going to ask you a question and you just try to make a concise list that's in a bullet point format.
So if I were to ask you, what do you usually buy at the grocery store?
You would just be like, "Milk, eggs, bread."
And that kind of idea, does that makes sense.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
So the first question is, can you please list all the things that might contribute to the development of having difficulties, like getting rid of clutter?
Interviewee:
The things that contribute to having clutter is things like an emotional attachment, someone gave you something, something that you like and don't want to get rid of, or that you think you'll need sometimes.
Is that what you mean about this?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Those are all good.
Interviewee:
You could have too much clutter depending on the size of your house too.
That's something important.
So those kinds of things.
