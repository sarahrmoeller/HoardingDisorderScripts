Interviewer:
Okay. So, it sounds like it's been throughout your life that this has been going on. 
Participant 17:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so how severe would you say this behavior is now?
Participant 17:
To you, because I'm being honest, I would say it's severe now because I've been... Before Covid, I was in the process of being diagnosed with MS, and I have a vision issue where it's destroyed the optic nerves so I have difficulty seeing squarely. Because of not feeling well so frequently, and some days not being able to get out of bed because I'm just plain too tired, things have piled up to the point where I would say you can not walk easily through my house. I would say to someone who came in that, "I've left clutter here because it helps me perfect my balance." Which in fact it does, if I had to step over and to the side. I would say it's probably a serious problem now. 
Interviewer:
Okay. I'm really sorry that's happening to you, but thank you for your honesty. So, you mentioned before the Covid and pandemic started that you were changing your behavior and cleaning out, have you gone to professional help for this?
Participant 17:
Numerous times throughout my life.
