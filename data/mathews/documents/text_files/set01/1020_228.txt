Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah. I just have a couple of last questions about how the current situation with the coronavirus pandemic has affected you. Do you feel like there's been an effect on your saving behavior at all, or has your saving and hoarding behavior changed because of COVID?
Participant 020:
I don't know that it's because of COVID so much, but I do think that the stay at home restrictions... I didn't realize. It took me several weeks to really recognize that because I'm very solitary and I tend to be shy, so I have a hard time making friends... I may not sound shy, but in terms of the kinds of behaviors that enable people to get to know each other, I'm not very good at it... I would often go out and go for a drive and buy food I didn't really need, or go to the store and look at such and such a place, and then I'd see a pair of earrings and I'd think I don't really need that, but they're awfully pretty. Because I can't do that now. It's really made me look at why was I doing this? Because I think I'm beginning to recognize that I need people more than I realized I did, and that a lot of those activities were kind of replacements for intimacy that I don't have in my life. Now, what I'm going to do about that, I don't know, but I-
Interviewer:
That's, I think, a really important realization.
Participant 020:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 020:
I think a lot of people, a lot of the distress that this could cause for so many other people is because most people that I've observed seem to have quite a few relationships in their lives, so they're really missing them, but I'm not. I don't have a lot. The people that I'm closest to live a long way away, so most of our contact is by phone and email.
Interviewer:
It hasn't really affected you socially-
Participant 020:
And I didn't-
Interviewer:
... as much as it's maybe affected everyone else.
Participant 020:
No. No.
Interviewer:
Has the threat of scarcity of items been an issue for you, the idea that things might run out?
Participant 020:
No. Not really. I happen to buy my toilet paper in large quantities anyway, so I have a big supply, and I would've been nervous if I'd gotten to the end of that supply and I still couldn't find anything, but I didn't have... I'm not afraid of death, particularly. I'm afraid of pain, but I'm not afraid of death, so I don't have a lot of the anxiety that people have about the implications of all of this.
Interviewer:
So you actually feel like maybe you've been less affected than most people. You haven't been worried about-
Participant 020:
I think that-
Interviewer:
... buying things.
Participant 020:
Yeah. Yes.
Interviewer:
You haven't really missed people-
Participant 020:
The only thing-
Interviewer:
... because you're already isolated.
Participant 020:
Yeah. I think the only thing I've done that's a little bit different is when I do go to the grocery store, I let myself buy a bigger variety of things and occasionally something that I might not normally think I could afford.
