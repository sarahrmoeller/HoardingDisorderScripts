Participant:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do it because sometimes I want to tell her to go to hell.
Interviewer (29:55): Right, right. So, in that case, I'm gonna move on a little bit down our sections. So, we talked a little bit about your space in your living area, and you told me that there's definitely parts of your home that you can use the way they're supposed to be used. But, now we're going to talk a little bit about your possessions in particular. So, for you, what makes them valuable? So, I know you said you really like to keep things that are pretty or, you know, look appealing to you, but what makes them valuable?
Participant:
Um, part of what makes them valuable is because some of the stuff, it’ real unique. But it’s unique to me; it wouldn’t be unique to my sister, or my aunt, or anyone else. Just, uh, I used to do Civil War reenacting, okay?
Interviewer (30:34): Right.
Participant:
So, I had a huge tan. I had clothing, I had jewelry— everything. And every time I look at jewelry, I'm always thinking about things that would be from the Civil War period. Even though I can't do it anymore. But, you know, I still look for things that would be for that. And then you’ve gotta have somewhere to put it.
Interviewer (31:02): Right. So, for you, it's about, you know, things being unique, but not necessarily like having financial value, for example.
Participant:
Right, right. Most of the stuff I got does not have financial value, it just has beauty value to me.
Interviewer (31:20): Okay. So, I could, I could assume then that it might be difficult for somebody else to understand the things that you keep and why you can keep them if they’re special to you?
Participant:
Right, right. 
Interviewer (31:32): Okay. So, what is considered trash to you? So, what, what is really easy for you to discard?
Participant:
Um, when I get around to going through my mail.
Interviewer (31:45): Mhmm.
Participant:
Just throw away the envelopes, the outside envelope, the inside envelope. I'm just pulling off the part that I can pay a bill. Seeing a bag of trash fill up is very exciting to me.
Interviewer (32:01): Right. So, you enjoy throwing things away, like when you get down to it, right?
Participant:
Yeah, I do, I do. I feel good about it, it's, it's just, uh, there’s not enough that I want to get rid of that would impact a lot of stuff.
Interviewer (32:23): And, I know you said earlier that—
Participant:
See when my sister moved in, it was very traumatic for me and most of my furniture in my condo. Because she brought her stuff.
Interviewer (32:33): Right.
