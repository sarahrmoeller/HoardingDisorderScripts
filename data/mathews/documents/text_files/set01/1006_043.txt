Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah. Do you think that your behavior is a problem?
Interviewee:
My behavior in keeping it is a problem. I'm not shopping anymore. Of course part of this is the pandemic helped, because I'm not running out to thrift shops and garage sales and estate sales. That's kind of helped me stop and really think about it.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. Have you ever sought to change this behavior? Or have you ever gone to a professional for help?
Interviewee:
No I haven't.
Interviewer:
Okay. Have you ever tried to change it or tried to find help in other places?
Interviewee:
I haven't sought help, other than seeking information on internet, watching the hoarding TV shows to try to realize how other people work through it and try to get myself motivated.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Right. How does your family and friends feel about your behavior? Have you ever had any conflict with them?
Interviewee:
Not really. Except that one of my sons, I have two sons. One is much more relaxed about things. But I have one that's very much like my mother, everything has to be neat and tidy in his life, and he works constantly. He can't seem to stop tidying up and cleaning and organizing. So coming to my house is uncomfortable for him. That's my biggest issue.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. All right. That's it for the first section. We can move onto the second one, which is space and living area. Please describe where you live now, and do you live alone? What's the space like?
Interviewee:
I live alone in a single family home with three bedrooms, two dogs, kind of a little storage porch and garage. Anything else?
Interviewer:
No. What would you want your home to look like?
Interviewee:
I would want it to be easy to navigate and I would like to, when I go into a room, not see something that I need to take care of. I would just like to, yeah, have everything have a place and be able to just do my normal cleaning without having to move things around.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. Then there's parts of your home that you would consider cluttered?
Interviewee:
Yes.
