Participant 007:
Yeah, I'm the classic person who falls for that, so I try not to.
Interviewer:
Okay. Also, during quarantine and COVID, how has your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items, has it increased? Do you feel like your items are more important to have around?
Participant 007:
No, actually, I'm more testy with them.
Interviewer:
Oh.
Participant 007:
I'm less attached to them. I just need to get myself together to get rid of things and I have a paper shredder. Shred papers that need to be shredded, because I'm one of these people, "Oh, I can't just put that in recycling. I have to shred it." So, I have a pile of papers on top of my shredder because I haven't shredded the papers yet. See, I make plans. I do have plans and then I have things like I belong to a group called, "Buy Nothing." There are a number of these groups throughout the country. It's B-U-Y, Buy Nothing, and it's hyper local. So, the one I'm in is just more... all things to work in it. It's before the City Hall was CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 007:
I get on because if they're looking for something I have and can put my hands on. There's no question there, but if they're looking for something that I have, then it's a way to get it out of my place and into the hands of someone who could use it.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 007:
So, that's something. Then, there's a group that they ... It's a local group, and instead of selling things in a store front to people, they give things away, and I really like that, like clothing and things that people who have nothing can go in and get. Clothes, books, and household items, and that sort of thing.
So, the problem is, of course, getting myself together, get things folded, and then to bag, and then I look for something [INAUDIBLE]
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 007:
It might lose weight if people hear this shit. I'm really getting into this. CROSSTALK I'm awful. I'm probably everything rolled into one, all the bad habits. Hoarders and clutterers.
Interviewer:
What I'm getting from is it seems that COVID has happened, you feel less attached to everything and you're more inclined to sort your items. You just haven't gotten to sorting and organizing and getting rid of things yet?
Participant 007:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 007:
Exactly.
Interviewer:
This is, maybe, thinking back a little bit on your life. Did your clutter behaviors ever affect your work?
Participant 007:
No. No, I don't think it ever affected my work.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 007:
No, not my work. My home life and, now, since I live alone, I am very, yeah. I went from a two bedroom HELL house to a small place filled with things to get rid of. All the stuff I should've gotten rid of.
