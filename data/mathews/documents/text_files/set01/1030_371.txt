Interviewer:
Right.
I remember you saying that you had been retired for a while.
All right.
My next question is how have you been coping since COVID-19?
What sorts of techniques have you found helpful in coping with all these changes?
Interviewee:
It's kind of hard to say because I don't really feel like the changes have effected me that much.
I kind of joke to some of my friends that it sort of brought out my inner hermit.
[INAUDIBLE] I've actually been reading a little bit more, which it seemed like I never had time to do so yeah, I don't feel like it's effected me negatively, at all.
Interviewer:
My next question was actually about where you seek comfort, and if you sought comfort from your items, but it kind of sounds like most everything has remained the same for you then?
Interviewee:
Yeah, pretty much.
Interviewer:
And you've had no changes to the people that you are living with during COVID or anything like that?
Interviewee:
No. Not, yeah, because it's just my husband and me.
I don't think it's effected him.
He's kind of doing what he's always done.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How about your family members that don't live with you and your friends that don't live with you, do you keep in contact with them?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
My mother is 90, and a couple years ago she moved into one of those places, but it's not assisted living.
It's residential living.
CROSSTALK They have a dining hall and recreation and she's actually coping really well.
[INAUDIBLE] ... this is the way I grew up, it's like no big deal.
But I think it is becoming, they're very, some people would say overly cautious because in theory they're not even supposed to visit their next door neighbor, but I think that's started to happen because you can do that for a couple, three months, but after that, at some point people are just, I think it's harder on her.
I think she lives about 500 miles away, and if we had a bigger house, she might consider moving in with us, but she's not at that point yet.
Interviewer:
How about your own sense of isolation?
I know you said your mom definitely felt that it was a bit isolating during COVID, but how about you?
Have you been effected at all in that sense?
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE]
... women and I think it's a little bit harder for them.
One of my other single friends works in financial services so they're considered essential so she's still working, and it hasn't really effected her and she still goes out and plays golf.
I do have a couple of friends who pretty much stay inside all the time, and I think it's a lot harder on them.
Interviewer:
But for you, it's mostly been just neutral, no big changes or anything?
Okay.
I just have a couple of demographic questions to ask you really quick, and then I'm going to ask for some info so that we can send you your card.
First off, what's your gender identity?
Interviewee:
Ma'am.
