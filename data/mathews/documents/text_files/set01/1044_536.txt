Interviewee44:
Less cluttered, you can see the floor.
Ten years ago, nine years ago, nine or ten years ago, it was clean then because we used to have a great big Easter egg hunt every year.
And I stopped then when my arthritis got too bad.
And I had to have it clean then, and I had to have the yard clean then.
Interviewer:
So, basically you'd just like a more open area where you're able to walk around easier, where the floor is clear of things and you'd be able to have maybe people over.
Interviewee44:
Yeah.
That'd be cleaner but yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah, so cleaner and more clutter-free is what I'm hearing.
Interviewee44:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, when you think about your possessions, I know you mention there are things like the piano and the mantle and the mirror, those have been in the house for 150 years, so you would consider them valuable because they're family possessions.
What other things would you determine how your objects are valuable or not?
Interviewee44:
I don't know.
I think my grandmother lived to be 100 in this house and it was bare.
And I'm like, "Well, why doesn't she have any stuff in here?" Now I realize it's simplified.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, you would say really the way to determine an object is valuable or not is how far back it goes maybe in the family or if it's family-related?
Interviewee44:
Yes.
In my bedroom I've got a big old oak dresser that I bought for $15 when we first got married, so I keep that.
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay.
So, maybe also something that is very useful but was also a good deal.
Interviewee44:
Oh yeah.
Interviewer:
Thinking about the items in your house, what would you say is the most precious item?
Interviewee44:
I don't know.
I've got some jewelry.
Interviewer:
And is that precious or valuable to you monetarily or are they family-related?
Interviewee44:
They're my first.
I do have some older stuff more valuable as the newer stuff.
Interviewer:
And what do you think would happen if you lost your jewelry?
Interviewee44:
I'd be angry, but I don't use it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So, I know you mentioned prior that you feel like some of your things just need to be distributed.
Do you think you have too much stuff and how do you decide when things are too much?
Interviewee44:
Yup, I have too much stuff.
Because there's piles of it everywhere and there's a lot of things that I need to send back that I ordered online.
But that takes time and organization to do that.
And that's not happening very well.
Every now and then I get a few boxes sent off.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, when things start piling up, it's getting hard to move around or you have things that you're not using, that's when you decide, okay, I think I have too much.
