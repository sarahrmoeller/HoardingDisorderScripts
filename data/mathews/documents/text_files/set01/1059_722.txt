Interviewee:
Yes. Yeah, so, um, I've got a really good system with my clothes and so that is there's a certain amount of space that is in the closet and that's how much space in the closet, there's an extra closet or not an extra place for any clothes. And so when, When that's and that's the right amount. And so, if I want to get something new and something got to come out. I don't have a problem with that. Now I'm taking it more space in the closet and my husband is, I recognize that. He hasn't asked to reclaim and of the space. So, the space that I have is my space and that is the right amount of space is what fits in there is the right amount of thing. Okay. But, I don't have that rule with the books. And so, the books; I can't see the books behind the books because there's books in the way. So, I see that that's too many books, but if I did get rid of five on the books out be really hard. Okay, I don't think I could do that.
Interviewer:
Okay, so for some things you have a set system, like for example your clothes. But for things that are more valuable to you, It's a little bit more difficult to realize when you have too much.
Interviewee:
Yes, yeah. Well I realize that I’ve got too much but I don't have a solution for reducing and there’s no space for another bookshelf. [UNCLEAR]
Interviewer:
So the last question in this section about value is. If you had to choose between your items. How do you think you would choose?
Interviewee:
Like if I had to choose.. Like if there was a fire?
Interviewer:
Pretty much. Yeah.
Interviewee:
How would I choose? I suppose I would choose to take what I could carry. Nothing that if I had to choose, I would choose on value. So probably grab take my jewelry, because even though I don't feel as emotional about that; attached to that, I feel it has more value. You know the money value. So that’s what I would choose based on money value. So I wouldn’t take my can openers.
