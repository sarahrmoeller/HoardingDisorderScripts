Interviewee:
Literally, we could not walk in our basement, we literally could not.
We have more Christmas decorations.
We could probably decorate five houses with the Christmas decorations we have, because we lived in non-Interviewer countries when our children were little, and so we had to bring the whole Christmas thing there to them.
Anyway, we couldn't even get them all out and we couldn't put them away because all the stuff was in the way.
Then that's when we decided we have to do something, plus we really couldn't go anywhere because of the quarantine.
It made us stop, drop and roll, stop, drop and sort.
I'm sorting.
They know my husband's first name at the place where he dropped off the donation to the charity, they do.
They run out to the car.
Interviewer:
What is the most precious item in your house for you?
Interviewee:
Probably pictures of my children and my granddaughter, things that they either made for me or pictures of them, I think, are probably the most precious.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What would happen if you lost those?
Interviewee:
Well, I think now with my new attitude, I'd probably be sad, but it wouldn't be devastating, I don't think.
I think I'd be just sad, but I could go on.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I have some real expensive jewelry, so I think that's probably real precious to me too.
Interviewer:
Okay.
This next section is talking about distinguishing hoarding disorder.
What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Hoarding disorder is collecting other control, right?
I think I have a lot of collections of different things and I display all of them, but the hoarding is the stuff that is basically worthless to me, I think.
You keep it because you might need it or that you paid too much for it.
That's what I always think of as being hoarding.
Collecting is maybe you have different items, but that you can use them or they're on display all at the same time, but hoarding, you don't display.
It's a secret behind the door.
Interviewer:
That's a good way to describe it.
No one's ever made that, I guess, definition.
Interviewee:
Oh really?
Wow.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
I feel like it makes so much sense and it should be so clear, but I've never heard someone put it in that way.
Interviewee:
Oh. Well, thank you.
Well, there you go.
