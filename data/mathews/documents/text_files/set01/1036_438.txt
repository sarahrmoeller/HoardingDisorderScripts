So I needed time to do it after my event and I would use to take, in the afternoon, it was a pleasant afternoon's task to do that and I INAUDIBLE my hose clamps lined up just right and just went about the preventative maintenance.
I'm a great believer of planned maintenance and that's from professional experience but the ...So I went to bite this off and it took me three days to get it done, at the end of three days I did not have things quite right.
My scars were all peeled up and bloody from the mishaps, and I knew INAUDIBLE even though I knew how I wanted my hand to move, my brain wouldn't make it do it.
It was INAUDIBLE, okay.
That's what made me decide that I couldn't use my hand tools anymore.
Interviewer:
So you really felt-
Participant 036:
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
You really felt that you had-
Participant 036:
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
You really felt limited by that.
So you felt better about giving up your space because you recognized how limited you were.
What is your space like now?
Participant 036:
Oh, yeah.
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
Is your space?
Participant 036:
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
So you told me-
Participant 036:
It was heartbreak for me to ...
Interviewer:
Go ahead.
Participant 036:
I'm sorry, it's a heartbreak for me and still I try to be a realest.
So it's a INAUDIBLE, it's a reality, too bad.
I'm straying from your question.
I did show up.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
No, I understand.
That is a really difficult thing to face and it sounds like you just had to accept it.
I understand that that would be really a difficult thing to accept.
Participant 036:
Yep.
Interviewer:
For somebody-
Participant 036:
The older you get, the easiest it is things that are to accept I think.
If it happened to me when I was 18 or 20, I'm going to have a much harder time than when it did.
It was tough enough INAUDIBLE.
It would've been worse if I were younger.
Interviewer:
Yeah, my dad always used to say, "Aging is not for sissies."
Participant 036:
There's some truth in that.
Interviewer:
Yep.
Participant 036:
And that's a INAUDIBLE when my wife had passed on or we had done our genetic duty, you might say if there's such a thing.
A societal and genetically reproduced , we've raised successful children, they were a literate and INAUDIBLE structure, that was a happy day.
I told INAUDIBLE, "We've done our work here, Jim."
So that was pretty much coasting, but yes you might say that's not quite the right term for it but ...
Interviewer:
Made it easier for you to accept that you felt like you'd had a very good and productive life.
Participant 036:
Yes, and demonstrated through my children and that's mostly because of my wife's genetics.
