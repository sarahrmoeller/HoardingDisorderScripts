Participant 24:
Not really. I don't keep trash. I'm not one that hoards a broken coffee pot or something, because I might use it later. That I would get rid of.
Interviewer:
So what counts is trash for you? When you look at your stuff and you say, "I can throw that out, that's trash."
Participant 24:
Now, that depends. Because some of the things that I've kept of my mother's, somebody else would say, "That's trash." She was a great traveler around the United States when she was young. And that was the time of just railroads. And she kept a lot of the railroad schedules and I thought, "Oh, somebody might like these. The people that collect railroad things or whatever." So I have those in a bag and I think about throwing them out, but I haven't done it, but it's really trash. But somebody else might like that.
Interviewer:
Do you recognize that it's maybe not necessarily intrinsically valuable, somebody might be a collector of railway schedules?
Participant 24:
That's correct, yes.
Interviewer:
Do you, when you think about your home, do you feel like you have too much stuff?
Participant 24:
Oh yes. I felt like that for the past, let's see, I've lived in this house probably the last ... not for the whole time I've lived in this house, but maybe the past 25 to 30 years.
Interviewer:
And how do you know? Why do you think you have too much?
Participant 24:
How do I know? Because it's taking up too much room. It's storing stuff and it's preventing me from having a nice, neat house. It's preventing me from having people over, because I even get embarrassed, having somebody come in and fix the furnace or something. And as I get older, it's just a pain to have dust around these thing and go through them if I want to find something.
Interviewer:
Have you ever thought about getting help with your problems with clutter?
Participant 24:
Oh, yes. I've thought about that. Well, I think I told you we had that little group, that's either four or five of us at the church.
Interviewer:
At your church.
Participant 24:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
But that didn't seem like it helped you.
Participant 24:
But interestingly enough, none of us wanted somebody else to go through our stuff.
Interviewer:
Everybody's private about their own stuff.
Participant 24:
Yes. It's my clutter, I don't want you to tell me what to throw away.
Interviewer:
Right, right, right. It's very personal to make that decision. Have you ever thought about going to a counselor or somebody who could help to talk to you about those sorts of issues to help you to do it? Or have you ever sought that about going to a professional organizer or somebody like that?
Participant 24:
I know that's available, but I don't think that's something I would turn to.
Interviewer:
How come?
