Interviewer:
Okay. What do you think makes them cluttered? Specific items or anything?
Participant 006:
Oh my gosh, I kept thinking that I'm retired, I'm going to do this craft and that craft and so forth. After I retired, I took a few classes for things I wanted to do and I started gathering all the equipment, the tools, the accessories that I would need to do all of these crafts. I have piles of jewelry making supplies, sewing supplies and the equipment, stained glass supplies. I mean it just goes on and on. By and large I've lost interest in a lot of those through the years anyway. I really need to move things away. But I keep thinking, I spent money on that and time on that, I really need to keep that in case I want to do it again.
Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah. Then would you say that your things are important for you to feel at home?
Participant 006:
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
Interviewer:
How important are your things for you to feel at home? If you didn't have them, would you feel less at home than you would now?
Participant 006:
I don't think so. I think I'd feel better.
Interviewer:
Okay, all right. Do you know which ones are the most important to you? I know you said that you lost interest in some of them back in March. But have you found others that are more important to you? And tend to spend more time with?
Participant 006:
Yeah. I would like to get back to painting, so I'd like to keep those supplies. I would like to continue sewing.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. Then are there parts of your home that you don't use? For example, for cooking, you wouldn't be using it for cooking, or you wouldn't be using your bathtub for bathing?
Participant 006:
Not really.
Interviewer:
So you would pretty much use everything, there's no areas of your house that are inaccessible?
Participant 006:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. All right. When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable? How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
Participant 006:
If it has use for me, either now or possibly in the future. If it would save me money.
Interviewer:
No go ahead, sorry.
Participant 006:
I was going to say, instead of going out and purchasing again, if I think I might need it, I'd like to hang onto it.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah, yeah. What would be trash for you? And would you discard?
Participant 006:
INAUDIBLE discarding anything other than normal kitchen scraps and recyclables from the kitchen.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. How do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Participant 006:
I really don't. I have a real problem with that.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. Do you have a most precious item in your house?
Participant 006:
Well, photos of my family, I think. And the few things that were left to me from my grandmother, and that's about it really.
