Interviewer:
Yeah. Thank you. So for the next part of the interview, I'm going to be reading you stories and I'm going to ask you questions and you just answer the questions to the best of your ability, okay?
Participant 1:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay. So for the first story, John Doe has several boxes that he likes to keep in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized but not usually cluttered. Occasionally it's different for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he's rarely late in getting where he needs to be. Okay. So the person depicted in the story, in your opinion, do you think they have hoarding disorder or is their behavior like a clutter problem?
Participant 1:
No. No. Neither. Neither.
Interviewer:
Okay. So why would you say that?
Participant 1:
Because they put them in the closet. Keeps them out of sight. I sometimes, but I've been religiously breaking down boxes and putting them in the trash. And because I used to ... and I do keep several boxes in my garage that I think I'm going to use for Christmas presents and those are sitting out in the garage. But no. I don't think he has a hoarding disorder. No. Not clutter. No.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. And is this behavior similar or different to that of your own, in your opinion?
Participant 1:
I don't store boxes in a closet and I don't have that many and I do throw them away. And I have a designated spot for my keys, but I've been in problems where I've lost my ... oh god, it drives me nuts. I can't find my keys anywhere. But that is not an issue of hoarding. That's an issue of memory. It's not hoarding. It's memory. And that's my memory is getting ... because I'm 66. So my memory is starting to go and not fun.
Interviewer:
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Participant 1:
It's not fun.
