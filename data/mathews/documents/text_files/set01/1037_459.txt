Participant 37:
The most precious...that's a good question.
I don't know if I have one that I hold above the others.
I mean I would say one thing that I really like is my ticket stub collection because it's relatively small.
It used to be relatively complete I don't worry about it quite as much anymore but I guess that's one type of memory thing that I can relive.
I'll tell you something funny about that.
I bought a small book and I put my ticket stubs in and I only went maybe four years into my ticket stubs and, many of them, if you'd asked me if I'd seen this particular event I would have said nah.
Interviewer:
So you don't even remember.
Participant 37:
Yeah so I don't even have the memory that I wanted to retrieve.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
But that's kind of funny.
I don't know it's that's in terms of... I actually did sell some ticket stubs for $500 each, believe it or not.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Participant 37:
This was a number of years ago and they probably over paid and I don't know if the market is still that good but one of my friends had tickets to a similar show and I sold two for her for $500 each too.
I could probably give you a smallish list of my collections but I don't know which one I would put higher than the others.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well I mean, that's good.
You did give an example that you do like a lot.
Going back to the ticket stubs and all that, what would happen if you lost it?
Would it be a traumatic event or would you be okay?
Participant 37:
No I don't think it would.
I think at this point I'd be sad.
I don't think it would be a tragedy.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
I think one reason I'd be sad is because I didn't sell them.
Interviewer:
So the loss of the money would be upsetting.
Participant 37:
Pardon me?
Interviewer:
The loss of the money would be upsetting but other than that CROSSTALK you'd be okay.
Participant 37:
Yeah, you know I do focus on that to some extent because of the experience of doing things like that.
Can I give you one more hoarding success story?
Interviewer:
Sure.
Participant 37:
I'm going to say when I was maybe 10 years old, I could have been younger, I got a... there was some kind of Bullwinkle club item.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 37:
Do you know Rocky and Bullwinkle?
Interviewer:
I do.
Participant 37:
Okay, good, you're a real [INAUDIBLE] kid.
So it was some Bullwinkle secret marching society or something it came in an eight by 10 envelope, there were maybe 10 pieces of paper in there, I'm not sure how many.
And early in my eBay career I sold that envelope of 10 pieces of paper for $200.
Interviewer:
Wow.
