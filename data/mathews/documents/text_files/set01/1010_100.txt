Interviewer:
Okay. You mentioned that the bills you have to keep them because of necessary reasons.
The CDs, are you keeping those because of emotional reasons?
Interviewee:
It's music CDs.
I keep them because I like to listen to them.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Perfect.
Which parts of your home do you consider cluttered?
Interviewee:
All of it.
I only have two rooms.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And you would say that they're all bills and CDs, things like that?
Interviewee:
Are they what?
Interviewer:
Bills and CDs and just things like that?
Interviewee:
No, the living room has got the bills and CDs, then I store clothes.
Interviewer:
The bedrooms are full of clothes, you said?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Way too many clothes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Are there parts of your home that you don't use?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
There's nothing, for example, there would be so much clutter that you can't use the stove for cooking or the bathtub to take a bath?
Interviewee:
I've got a little tiny kitchen table that I don't use because it's got things all over it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
All right.
Interviewee:
Bread and cookies and that kind of thing.
Interviewer:
All the good stuff.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Are there places in your home that make it not so easy to walk around?
Interviewee:
Parts that make me walk around?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Walking around.
Interviewee:
I don't really understand the question.
Interviewer:
Oh.
Sorry.
Are there parts of your home that makes it difficult to walk around?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What parts?
Interviewee:
The living room.
Interviewer:
Okay, and if you could, the bills and CDs?
Interviewee:
Yeah, and there's general stuff on the floor.
Cat litter.
Cat litter box.
Cat toys.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
And just stuff.
Interviewer:
Just stuff in general, yeah.
When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?
Interviewee:
Valuable to me would be if I need them or not.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Valuable to somebody else would be if they work or not I guess.
Interviewer:
Okay, so that you determine if an object is valuable or not is seeing if it still has some use to you.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
All right.
How do you determine when something is trash?
Interviewee:
If I have a trash can, I guess I'll throw it in the trash.
I don't know what you mean how do I determine it.
Anything that's a piece of paper that I don't need to keep is trash.
I go through a lot of cups because I don't like to wash dishes.
I use styrofoam cups and all that's trash.
That's part of the problem.
A lot of cigarette butts, ashtrays, that's part of the problem.
Interviewer:
And how do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Such as your styrofoam plates or cigarettes?
Or the cat litter?
Interviewee:
Probably on the schedule.
Probably.
I clean up anything that's easy to clean up every day, and at least every other day, like emptying an ashtray or something like that.
As far as vacuuming the floor and mopping and stuff like that, that's a problem.
