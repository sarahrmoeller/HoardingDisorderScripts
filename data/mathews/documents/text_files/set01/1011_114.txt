Interviewer:
Yeah, does your behavior upset you or do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant 011:
It doesn't get in the way of my life because I skirt it, I get around it. But it's like I told you, it sort of encompasses... Makes things a little more difficult for me to do everything. Man, I've been doing it for so many years, I managed it really well. And I can live with all this stuff. At the same time, I manage my life fairly well. I'm not tied down by it. I can take vacations and whatnot. And nobody in my family, like I told you earlier, has accused me of being a hoarder. So one of my daughters once said to me that, "Dad, you just hoard everything," and I kind of got angry here at that time. That was about 30 years ago. I kind of got angry at her at the time, and then she became a hoarder. So, what can I say? Maybe it is in the genes here. That's what I [inaudible 00:51:48] I was thinking, "Well, maybe it's some genetic stuff going on here that we can't control." And I don't know how this study, the one you're working with, is attached to the genetics study, but I would be really interested to find that out.
Interviewer:
Yeah, that would be interesting. And what do you-
Participant 011:
Because I'm saying my family, it has a tendency to hoard, but I'm the worst of the lot. But there's other people in my family are doing the same thing I'm doing. So, I don't know if it's contagious or not. Maybe it's a distant contagious genetic frailty of sorts. But anyway, it's interesting, this hoarding thing. And it doesn't depress me. Like you asked me earlier, it's not depression. I don't get depressed. I get encumbered by it. And at the same time, it encumbers me, it always traps me. But then I feel secure within that encumbrance. So, it's a double deep blue sea divers thing here. I enjoy having a lot of stuff around me. At the same time, I feel it's a burden and a weight on me.
And a lot of people do this, but that's what you get with having too many possessions. But like I told you, I'm not attached. I can drop it in a second. I'm wanting to get rid of all the stuff. It's just so hard. It's so hard to find the right type of people who want to take over the... Unload me of things without stealing. But I'm bringing boxes to the Goodwill every month, so it's happening. It's coming along. One of these days, I'll get the garage cleaned up.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
