Interviewee33:
I would say somewhere in the middle, somewhere moderately up.
Not that I can't believe... I kind of look around in my house and I can't believe it looks like this, especially my parents always kept a very tidy house, but then again, they had a huge house.
They had places to put all of the things that they used on a daily basis.
For us, there's a stack of my kids' homework books under the living room coffee table because that's the best place to put them.
That's where we can get them easily and work on them and then find them again.
I don't know, but my parents never would have gone for something like that.
I think that I could get rid of a lot of stuff.
It could be a lot better, but it's not dangerous.
It could be a lot worse also.
It's mostly functional.
I would say somewhere in the middle, moderately bad, moderately severe.
Interviewer:
Okay, moderately...
Not dangerous, could be better, could be worse.
Interviewee33:
Yeah, exactly.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Have you ever sought to change your clutter problems or gone to a professional for help with clutter problems?
Interviewee33:
No, identify like a professional would understand.
I don't know.
For one thing, it would cost extra money.
We're kind of keeping the budget as tight as possible and it feels like it's something I should be able to do myself and it's something that I could understand more personally about what I would want to do than a professional could, although doesn't everyone think that and [INAUDIBLE] always professionals usually do a better job of things than you ever could do on your own.
I would say that we probably would never actually pay money for someone to do that.
There are just too many other things that are more important than that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Gotcha.
So it would cost extra money.
There are other things that are higher on the priority list that would be more worth or it would be worth it to spend money on those things before that.
Interviewee33:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
It's something that you feel like you should be able to do yourself.
Okay.
You said moving into your house and what your space is like.
I know you described that it's a small house and you have your husband and two kids.
Do you have any animals that live with you as well.
Interviewee33:
We have two cats.
Interviewer:
Two cats.
Awesome.
I love cats, but unfortunately, my wife is very allergic, so we have a dog instead.
Interviewee33:
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Does your home currently look like how you would like it to look?
Interviewee33:
No, it does not.
Interviewer:
How would you like your home to look?
Interviewee33:
I feel like I'm being redundant if I say uncluttered or neat and tidy.
Interviewer:
That's okay.
