Participant 040:
Other than books?
Well, let's see.
Say that again.
Interviewer:
Sure.
So, outside of books, are there any other places you've heard about hoarding disorder?
Participant 040:
Yes.
I watched a program.
Let's see.
What's the name of that?
It was a veterinary outfit out in Texas, and people would go in and get the animals where there'd be too many animals in a space, trash, and poop, and all sorts of gross stuff.
I don't have any gross stuff, but they would get them out.
Then they would show the house.
I hear about bodies that are found.
You'll think about two brothers, one day, one of the brothers disappeared, and then the other brother was, the day he died.
He got dead.
Then when they got in, they found the other brother.
This is from television.
I didn't watch but one or two episodes of that hoarding.
I don't know what the title is of the program was, but those people.
It turned my stomach.
So where else have I heard about how they ...
Of course, I saw it in my mother.
Showed evidenced of it in my one daughter.
Interviewer:
So, when you think about the words hoarding disorder, what comes to mind?
Participant 040:
Someone who can't throw things away or give it away, who's so tied up in her own value that she's got to keep it all.
"Oh, isn't that a neat ..."
Makes me think.
Interviewer:
So being so caught up in, can't give things up.
Participant 040:
Your own important.
Interviewer:
Caught up in your own importance?
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Would you say that this gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant 040:
Oh, yeah.
Me having so much stuff?
Interviewer:
Uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 040:
Yeah, definitely because I can't find things that I want to do.
I've put them in a box, and I can't find what I want to do.
So I spend the time looking for something instead of doing it.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
So, you're spending all this time looking for it instead of doing it.
Can you describe a time that you can think of that hoarding problems got in the way of something you really wanted?
Participant 040:
No. Nothing stands out.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I know you mentioned that you used to own a shop.
Am I correct?
Participant 040:
Yes.
It was a gift shop.
Interviewer:
Okay.
A gift shop.
Did any of these kinds of issues get in the way of that?
Or work in general?
Participant 040:
No, not actually, because I knew that people who came into the store would not like to see a jumble.
They would not like to see dust.
We made sure that things were taken care of, and were neat and tidy.
You can't spend time looking for things when someone calls and says, "Do you have?"
Interviewer:
You have to know where it's at?
Participant 040:
Yeah.
