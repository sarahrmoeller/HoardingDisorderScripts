Interviewer:
Yeah, so other than these two rooms with the clutter would you say that the rest of the house is cluttered or is it usable space as well?
Participant 37:
No, none of the house...at this point in time, the garage is no longer clutter because the floors are clear and you can see the shelves.
No, the only clutter I would say is mine.
Interviewer:
So then is your home the way that you would like it to look or are there any changes other than, of course, the decluttering that you have been doing?
Participant 37:
That's the only thing that really needs to be changed.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How important are your collections and your things for you to feel at home in your space?
Participant 37:
I still have certain collections that I'm attached to.
I guess I'm becoming a little less attached to some of my collections.
I used to have I'm guessing about 1,000 record albums.
I sold all of those, almost all of them, a few years ago, maybe five years ago.
This is, I think an important fact for you, my mother died five years ago approximately, a little less than five years ago.
She was sick, she needed home care before that so during the point where she needed the home care we had to declutter her house.
And then when she died we also had to completely declutter her house.
So I think that taught me that I didn't want my children to have to go through what I went through.
At this point in time they still would unless my wife just hired the dumpster [INAUDIBLE].
That's kind of one thing that drives me.
Interviewer:
So your motivation is for your children not having to go through what you went through with your mother's things?
Participant 37:
Right, and one of the other things that encouraged me was something that happened maybe 20 years ago when I was selling another collection that I had was the impermanence of it and the fragility of it and the knowledge if I kept [INAUDIBLE] going to disintegrate so I'd rather let somebody else give me a few hundred dollars and let them worry about disintegration.
I guess that's another part of the practical and monetizing aspect of my collecting and hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Now we're going to move on to a section about value.
When you think about your possessions, of course you've mentioned monetary value and the experiences that you had with these objects.
What else makes them valuable to you?
