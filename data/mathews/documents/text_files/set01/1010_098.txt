As you know, this study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.
I'm going to refer to a certain term referring to hoarding disorder.
Do you have any specific term that you want me to use?
Such as organization anxieties?
Participant 010:
No. Interviewer:
Just hoarding is fine?
Participant 010:
That's fine.
Interviewer:
Okay, perfect.
That's the first section done.
Now, the second section is going to be a little bit more casual.
It's not going to be as listing as this one was.
So, we can start with can you please describe your hoarding or not hoarding, as you said?
How long has this been going on?
Participant 010:
I've always collected stuff and I've always been lazy.
I was like that my whole life.
Interviewer:
Okay, and do you think your behavior is severe now?
Participant 010:
Repeat that one?
Interviewer:
How severe would you say this behavior is now?
Participant 010:
Not severe.
My biggest problem is cleaning up the house.
If I had enough money to hire a maid, I wouldn't have a problem at all.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you don't think that your behavior is a problem at all?
Participant 010:
My sloppy behavior is probably a problem.
As far as hoarding things?
No, that's not a problem.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you ever thought to change this behavior?
Participant 010:
Sure.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you ever gone to a professional for help with clutter?
Participant 010:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Why not?
Participant 010:
I just never thought that was ... I wouldn't spare the money.
Number one, I never thought it was enough of a problem to warrant getting anything like that.
I mean, enough that you would tell a psychiatrist that would help him help you get over it.
Except the fact that you're lazy.
