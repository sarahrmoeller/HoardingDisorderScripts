Interviewer:
Okay. All right, all right. She didn't keep them anywhere? 
Participant 006:
Right, she did not. 
Interviewer:
All right. 
Participant 006:
Caused a lot of trouble. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah. Good. I have one more vignette to go through. It's about value and things that are valuable. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. Okay. Do you think this person has hoarding disorder? 
Participant 006:
Not sure if it's hoarding or just organization. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. 
Participant 006:
I'm very like that, with things that I think are valuable, and I don't want to just get rid of them because they might have some value. Either to me or to someone else later. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 006:
But I find a lot of times, when I want to get rid of things I think, well I can at least try to have a yard sale, because this is actually a valuable item, even though it no longer is to me or to my children, I still know that it has a monetary value. So it's difficult to let go. 
Interviewer:
Okay. With that kind of item, would you be willing to sell it? Or would you be willing to give it away in some kind of yard sale? 
Participant 006:
If I knew it was going to someone that would appreciate it, I would be willing to give it. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Good. How do you think your family would feel? If they heard you say ... Do you consider that some kind of progress? That you could give it away if you knew it was going to a home where it was going to be appreciated? 
Participant 006:
Yeah, probably. They would think it was progress for me. 
Interviewer:
Would you consider that progress for you? If you were able to do that? 
Participant 006:
Yeah, I guess. 
Interviewer:
You don't sound too convinced. 
Participant 006:
I'm not. I'm really struggling with this. I have so much that I enjoy, even though I know it's useless to someone else. I don't know. It's very difficult to decide. Go ahead.
