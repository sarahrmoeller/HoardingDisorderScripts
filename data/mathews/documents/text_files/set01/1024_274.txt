So that's why it's an interesting place now.
My kitchen, I'm using for eating, of course, and for reading newspapers and doing the mail and those kinds of things.
And I have a 42 inch round oak table, which has just enough room on it for me to put a plate.
The rest of it is piled up with magazines or books or just stuff.
Mail, that kind of thing.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And if you could wave a magic wand, what would you like your house to look like?
Interviewee:
No, I didn't catch that either because my dog coughed.
Say it again.
Interviewer:
I said, if you could change things with a magic wand and just wave your magic wand, what would your house look like?
Interviewee:
My house would look more spacious and the stuff that I don't use would be gone because why am I keeping it?
And I can invite people over for breakfast or lunch or something.
And it would just be more tidier and, well, yeah, just be more tidier and clean, spacious looking.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So when you say tidy, you mean like everything in its proper place?
Interviewee:
Yeah, because I keep a lot of things.
I'm standing right now talking to you, I'm leaning on my kitchen counter.
Then the wall where the sink is.
And on the wall behind me, has all these old notes tucked into the little ledge there.
And they're things that either I want to remember or things that I need to do and they just pile up.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And so ideally, all of those things would be gone.
And you would have a clear counter.
Interviewee:
Yes.
I probably wouldn't be as interesting to myself.
Interviewer:
I see.
I see.
So there's a trade off.
You would have to trade off some of the things that are interesting, to have the space.
Interviewee:
And as I get older, I have to write notes to myself or I'll forget what I'm doing.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So you think that your things maybe help you with your memory sometimes too.
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
If you were going to get rid of things, which are the things that you would definitely keep, like if you were on your priority list of items in your home, what are the things that you are sure under no circumstances would you ever get rid of?
Interviewee:
Can you call me back by any chance?
Interviewer:
Sure.
Is the reception still really bad?
Interviewee:
My dog, I think, is eating things?
Oh, shit.
