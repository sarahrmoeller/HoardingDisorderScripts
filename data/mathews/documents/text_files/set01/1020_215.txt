Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
For sure.
Have you ever met anyone-
Interviewee:
I mean, some of the stuff-
Interviewer:
Go ahead.
Some of it...
Interviewee:
No. Have I ever met anyone what?
Interviewer:
I was going to ask if you had ever met anyone and suspected that they had hoarding without knowing, based on looking at their space or watching them?
Interviewee:
There's-
Interviewer:
Have you ever met someone and been like I wonder-
Interviewee:
Yeah.
There's...
Or like if they're borderline.
I know a couple of people, like my brother, who just going to their house kind of makes my skin crawl.
There's one friend who lives in the same housing complex as my brother, and he can at least clear a seat for me to sit down if he knows I'm coming, but that's the only space in the whole space that doesn't make my skin crawl.
But I can see that there might be in between...
Now, you know what, I'm wondering...
I'm not sure that there would be really good signs that you could tell, because I know so many people who have beautiful homes with beautiful possessions, and maybe more than they need, but nothing that seems completely out of the way.
I can really tell the people whose homes are very bare, which is not the same as barren, where they picked pieces that go together nicely but not a lot of them, or something like that.
I think I would have trouble with somebody who was sort of in between.
Interviewer:
For the last list I'd like to make with you, I'd like you to list for me all of the reasons that you think someone might want to seek treatment for hoarding problems.
Interviewee:
Well, the first one that would come to my mind for myself is wanting to be able to overcome a lot of shyness and at least have a place where I might feel okay inviting somebody into the house.
I don't know what you'd call that.
Social anxiety?
A recognition that I'm keeping people away?
Interviewer:
Wanting to invite people into your home, maybe.
Interviewee:
Right.
I lost the chance once to have a friend as a roommate.
She was looking for housing when I needed a roommate, and she just had to tell me very bluntly, "I couldn't live somebody like you," and that was painful.
I mean, I really respected her telling me, but it was painful.
It would be wanting to be able to keep connections or make connections closer.
Seek treatment.
I don't know.
I think...
Interviewer:
Okay.
The main reason for you that you would want to-
Interviewee:
CROSSTALK
Interviewer:
Go ahead.
Interviewee:
Right.
It would be having the money to do it or the resources to do it would be part of it, because there isn't much, except for Hoarders Anonymous or Debtors Anonymous, that I know of where somebody could get help at very low cost or minimal cost.
Interviewer:
So people might want to seek treatment if they're able to afford it.
Interviewee:
Right.
A lot more liable.
