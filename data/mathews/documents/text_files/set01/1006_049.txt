Interviewer:
Have the people living with you changed during COVID?
Interviewee:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. How have you kept in contact with family and friends?
Interviewee:
Email, Facebook, messaging, telephone, Zoom.
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you interact with them often?
Interviewee:
Daily.
Interviewer:
Daily.
Interviewee:
Not everybody daily.
Interviewer:
That's good.
Interviewee:
But yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
But someone at least daily.
Interviewer:
Good. I know you mentioned that you were feeling a little bit lonely. Did you feel socially isolated or lonely prior to COVID?
Interviewee:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. Then you would say that COVID has affected your sense of isolation?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Have you experienced conflict during COVID-19? With measures or anything else?
Interviewee:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. That was the end of this little section. Now, I want to go onto the section called vignettes, which is essentially, I'm going to read you a little prompt, then I'm going to ask you if the person in these prompts could have hoarding disorder, or their behavior's more cluttered rather than hoarding. Then if this person should try to change their behavior, do you think they require treatment from a psychiatrist? And if it's similar or different than yours. I can repeat all these questions at the end of each little story if you want me to. I just wanted to give you a heads up.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay. The first one, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he might need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized, but is usually not cluttered. Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is rarely late in getting where he needs to be.
Okay. Do you think that the person here could have hoarding disorder? Or more clutter?
Interviewee:
I wouldn't call it either one, honestly. It sounds pretty normal to me.
Interviewer:
Okay yeah. Do you think they should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee:
Could he find a specific spot to keep his keys and wallet?
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. You don't think that he would require treatment from a physician or a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
Not really.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Interviewee:
No.
Interviewer:
Would you say that this behavior is similar or different to your own.
Interviewee:
Similar, I was never late for work or anything because of this. I do keep the boxes, but [INAUDIBLE] then because I keep thinking I'm going to put things in them to bring to the thrift shop.
