Participant:
Um, well, in that craft room. I've been trying to spend at least 30 minutes a day. But that's because I'm working from home. And that's where I keep my computer. I'm really wanting to— I'm trying to get that room to a point that I can work in there. I'm working in their full time, and I'm going to continue working in their full time— I'm not going back into an office. But, I want to make it a comfortable, a nice space. I want to make it a nice space for me.
Interviewer (25:00): Okay, so you would say that because of you know, the quarantining, that's kind of motivated you a little bit more to clean the space?
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer (25:11): Okay, gotcha. So, now we're going to talk a little bit about what makes your possessions valuable. So, my first question is, um, literally just that. When it comes to your possessions, how do you determine if they have value or they don't have value?
Participant:
Um, well, I guess it goes back to when I, when I look at things. It's things that I’m saving. They fall into one of two categories. They're either I'm saving them because they mean something to me. Like, gosh, people save greeting cards. I mean, I have saved greeting cards from stuff that my kids have given me, you know. And does it really matter? Should I be saving them? Probably not, but it's a really hard thing to throw away, something a child has given me. So, these all fall under sentimental, or they fall under— gosh, this is a great jar, this is a great box. Um, I'm sure I'm going to need this someday. I'm sure I'm going to wish I had this someday. And that's, there's, and there's the danger. So, what I was trying to do was clean out this, like this, craft room, and then give away like all the extra yarn. You know, the yarn that that I’m not personally going to use. Things that I don't like the color, I don't like the feel of it, I don't like whatever. I mean, I'm a, I'm a fiber artist. I knit, and I spin, and I weave. So, I have a lot of yarn, I have a lot of fiber. I'm always going to have a lot of the yarn and a lot of fiber, probably more than I could use, you know, in my lifetime. Knowing though, that at some point I will retire and will not have the money to spend on these things. So that part of it doesn't concern me. It's the other stuff. It's, it's like looking at this going, I hate this. Why am I keeping it? And then giving it away.
Interviewer (27:35): Okay, so trash for you is something that you really just don't like, in terms of like, it's used or its appearance.
