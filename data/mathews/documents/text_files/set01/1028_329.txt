There is memories attached to them. But I have three boxes up in my studio of other things that have sentimental value to them, and I can't have them all out in my house if there's not enough space, so I switch them out. That has evolved into, "Hey, if I put stuff that isn't really sentimental value, but useful, but haven't used it, and I might not actually use it, if I just start a box like that, then I can just get rid of that box."
A lot of rationalizing going on.
Interviewer:
You're very aware of it though, which is interesting to hear, because you acknowledge that it does cause you discomfort at times, yet there are reasons that make sense to keep the items, too.
Participant 28:
Yeah, and you know, I do have a background in psychology and mental health, and I believe in looking at myself and trying to improve myself, like I don't want to have low self-esteem, so if I find I do I want to have a strategy to work on that, and I found if certain things are too difficult to work on, I have to work on my attitude about them.

That might be interesting." And she wanted to tell me all about how she does that and how positive it's been for so many people, and the more I heard about her process, like actually coming into my home and helping me go through things and stuff, I felt my anxiety just go up, up, up.
"Oh my god, I could never have someone come in my home and help me do this. Oh my god." And that was really interesting to me. Plus, then she told me she charges 165 dollars an hour. I'm like, "Holy crap. I should do that myself and put aside 165 dollars an hour for some special trip." Anyway, I didn't, so.
Interviewer:
It seems like there's a lot of anxiety attached to discarding items and having to decide what should be kept and what can be let go of, and that's what's-
