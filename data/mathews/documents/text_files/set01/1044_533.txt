Interviewer:
Okay. Well, those are some great lists and that concludes our list-making section. So, now we're going to move into the more discussion portion of the interviews. My first question is please describe your issues with collecting treasures and how long has it been going on?
Participant 44:
It's gotten progressively worse over the last 10 years. My husband passed a year-and-a-half ago. He kept turning on Hoarders on television, the television show. And the dining room is totally full of stuff. And I haven't moved any of his stuff out. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so you mentioned that your husband passed and you're still holding on to some of his things and that's contributed to some of the clutter and such. And it's gotten worse over the last 10 years. 
Participant 44:
Yes, it's got worse over the last 10 years. I've got a lot of stuff in here that's Christmas stuff and things that I've bought online and paperwork that I need to be doing and his clothes. 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative) okay, so clothes and paperwork. How severe would you say that this problem is now? And do you believe your behavior is a problem?
Participant 44:
Yeah. I went to some program they had at the senior center about falling because I do fall a lot. And they had a grant from Stanford to come out to your house and help you. And I'm like, "I'm not calling them to come out to my house." So, yeah. It would have been useful for me but I sabotaged myself. 
Interviewer:
I understand. And how severe do you think this problem is?
Participant 44:
Want me to take a picture for you?
Interviewer:
No, that's fine. 
Participant 44:
It's pretty severe. I don't know. My bedroom is really bad, it's hard. And I have to go to the other end of the house to go to the bathroom because the main bathroom, the part that they don't carry in California anymore that needs to be replaced. And it's just deferred and ridiculous. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. So, you mentioned this possible program. Other than that, have you ever sought to change this behavior or gone to a professional?
Participant 44:
For hoarding, no. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Why or why not? 
Participant 44:
Why or why not? I'm not sure what a professional would do for that. 
Interviewer:
I see. And so you mentioned your husband would turn on the TV with the show about hoarding, but how did he feel about your behavior? And how did other friend and family feel about your behavior?
Participant 44:
Well, there was a couple that we played dominoes with, go to dinner and play dominoes once a week. And we used to go to either their house or my house. We stopped going to my house because it was too messy. 
Interviewer:
And how did they feel about it? How did they feel about that?
Participant 44:
I don't think they cared.
