Interviewer:
So you base trash or you know when it's time to get rid of something when it's extremely worn or it doesn't really have a use for you.
Or you feel better about getting rid of it, if you can donate it to someone you know needs it.
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So what would you consider your most precious item in your house for you?
Interviewee:
Wow.
In a fire if I were to run out.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
That's pretty much what everyone does...
In that scenario, what would you be able to grab?
What would you be like, "I need this."
Interviewee:
I guess, pictures on my computer or phone.
Just because information is on there.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Because things like that wouldn't really be replaceable, but you could get a new bed, or a new couch, or something like that.
Interviewer:
Well, how about if you just lost these, not necessarily in a fire but you just couldn't find them?
Interviewee:
The phone or computer or pictures that I mentioned.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
If those are your most precious item, what would happen if you lost those?
Interviewee:
I guess I'd be sad, but...
Well, I don't know.
I'd be disappointed, but I would have to rely on my memory to conjure up those thoughts again.
And perhaps I could get some of the information back from other people, phone numbers, or information on the computer from different sites, or pictures that maybe somebody else has duplicates or of the kids or something when they're little.
Because I would say the kids being little is the pictures that I probably cherish the most because you can't get that time back.
Interviewer:
Well, that makes sense.
So briefly before you mentioned that you think that you have too much stuff, your closet, you might have too much clothes.
How do you decide when it's too much and when it's time to get rid of something?
Interviewee:
I think basically when you go to put more hangers in there with clean clothes on them.
And then you just really squeeze and can't fit them in.
So I suppose if I had double the closet space, I probably would say, "Oh, it's okay.
I have just enough."
Interviewer:
So you judge it based on the space and how much room you have.
Interviewee:
I think so.
Yeah.
