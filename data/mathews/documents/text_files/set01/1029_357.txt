Participant 29:
I'm not going anywhere to use a card. So I don't know, maybe it won't get used either way.
Interviewer:
Well if you have the physical card, you can use it both online and in person, since you have the information. So we can send you that. 
Participant 29:
Perfect. You just know that things get lost in my papers, so I was thinking seriously, should I? I'm trying to change my ways.
Interviewer:
It's up to you. I was about to say, but I didn't want to mention that.
Participant 29:
Let me try it online. Let me see how I do with that.
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 29:
It'll be an interesting change. I haven't don't anything like that before, so I like learning new ways to do things. 
Interviewer:
We'll go ahead and give you that opportunity then. We'll send it your way so you should receive an email with that gift card and if for some reason you don't receive it, then you have those two numbers to contact that I gave you earlier on today.
Participant 29:
Perfect. Okay.

Participant 29:
Correct.
Interviewer:
We already know your geographic region. And your highest level of education?
Participant 29:
I have a Bachelor of Science degree.
Interviewer:
And just out of curiosity for our own personal sake, what was your job that you had prior?
Participant 29:
I was a human resources director for a major corporation. I worked my way up, so I had a bunch of jobs, but the last quite a few years of my career was in human resources, and I'm originally from Rochester, New York. But what brought me to Florida was I got a job transfer to our Latin America region. So I was working mainly in South America the last couple of years.
Interviewer:
Oh, okay.
Participant 29:
And I had a home in Miami. But, after I retired, I really didn't want to stay there. So I moved here. 
Interviewer:
And you've been there ever since.
Participant 29:
I started in marketing, just short story. I found it very unrewarding, and decided I wanted to do something more rewarding. So I transitioned into the human resources field.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 29:
And had a number of jobs within the organization. But worked my way up to a director level in a major corporation. So that was pretty good.
Interviewer:
That is cool to hear. Thank you for sharing that with me.
