Participant 50:
Sometimes. I mean, I don't have cable, so it's not on anything, but sometimes it's a little bit harsh to watch something that hit so close. But sometimes I find it interesting because if I watch, I'm watching to listen to the person that's coming into their home to help them. If you notice all the people that are able to conquer it through their help, they're able to pull out everything and then put things back. That's sort of hard in an everyday thing where you can have somebody with a dumpster come to your house and you pull out everything. Because just the thought of doing that feels like exposure. If I lived in my own home and I had a backyard, heck yeah, I would do it. But living in an apartment, I'm still sort of scared in order to accomplish that. But if I do watch it, I'm watching it to feed what the counselor's telling them.
Interviewer:
That makes total sense. Yeah. So you use it kind of as a source of advice, but at the same time, it's frustrating because you'd love somebody to come in and just say "Okay, we're doing this and getting rid of all your stuff." Because that is exactly what it sounds like you'd like to do. But also because you don't have the privacy for that. You worry that would also be kind of like all of your neighbors would be seeing you do that if you were to do it, so.
Participant 50:
Yeah. But it's not so much the part of wanting to be able to do it. I mean, have someone do it for you because of the fact that I've had friends, that volunteer that say they will come on over but it's very stressful to have somebody at your house and then they're so afraid to throw away anything. Or how should I say it? They have to ask you for about every piece of something. So it's more stressful for me. And it takes up more of my time because one time my sister-in-law came over and so we decided we're going to try to do the kitchen. For every five seconds she was asking me about something and to try to push her onto one section and say, "If you could just do this," it was very difficult because it was always requiring me to refer back to me. So I couldn't get her working on something while I was working on something else. Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Sure. She can't make the decisions for you. So she ends up asking you and that ends up taking twice as much time because you're having to tell her what to do.
