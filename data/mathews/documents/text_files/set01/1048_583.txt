Participant 48:
Yeah. Well, I never was able to finish cleaning my room.
It was always like a hard thing.
I'd be punished and, two or three days into it, before I would get my room passable or clean enough, and this is back when I didn't really keep a lot of stuff.
I just start a project and walk away from it, and don't think to put everything away.
I expect it to be there when I get back.
And so, cleaning my room has always been an issue as long as I can remember.
More recently, the books wasn't really hoarding.
The books was collecting, and I'll defend that, even though I had, I don't believe I have too many books.
But if that were the circumstances, I think mostly my apartment wasn't big enough.
But having lost the books, I still have lots and lots and lots of different things.
All of which, I think, have value.
I think I need.
And I just need to being able to put them all together.
I have three rugs and carpet.
I have lots of clothes, lots of kitchen stuff, lots of, lots and lots of paper and pens.
A lot of stuff.
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay.
And how-
Participant 48:
INAUDIBLE.
Interviewer:
Oh, I'm sorry.
So do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
And why or why not?
Participant 48:
Yes, it's a problem for me, because it consumes a lot of my time.
It causes a lot of anxiety for me and for my roommate, people around me.
It's embarrassing.
And I always think that, and my therapist laughed at this, she doesn't want to hear it any more, but I always think that I can get it clean in two weeks.
Give me two weeks, and I can make this livable.
I can make it orderly.
But that two weeks has been going on for 20 years, 40 years.
And it doesn't, hasn't been the last two weeks.
Interviewer:
I understand that.
Participant 48:
And I'm always cleaning.
I'm always trying to organize this.
I get caught up in the minutia, and I tend to lose focus quickly.
So I'll start cleaning a pile and look at something, and then it'll remind me of something else, and then 10 minutes later I'm 14 steps away from cleaning the pile, and the pile's long forgotten.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So you believe this behavior is a problem for you because it's affecting your mental health negatively.
You're having anxiety from this.
Participant 48:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Yeah, definitely.
I understand that.
Have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Participant 48:
Well, socially it's restrictive.
It's very restrictive socially.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 48:
What was your question?
Interviewer:
Oh, I just asked if you've ever sought to change this behavior, in the sense that, have you gone to a professional or done any self-help, or anything that you think that you have done to change this behavior.
