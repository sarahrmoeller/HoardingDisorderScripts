Participant 020:
... actually begun to get rid of a lot of stuff, but I still kind of have the impulse, and it is still difficult sometimes for me to get rid of things that I'm really not using, to accept that fact that some of my stuff.
I would say I'm sort of part way along the process of dealing with my hoarding, but I still have quite a ways to go to deal with my clutter.
Interviewer:
We'll talk about it in terms of your clutter, because it sounds like you feel like you have done a good job in dealing with things, such that it doesn't sound like you think that you have hoarding right now.
Participant 020:
Well, I think I have, in the sense that I have a lot of things that I don't need.
I think I probably am hoarding, if that's one definition of it, but I don't think I'm adding to new stuff to my hoard, except occasionally books that I get passed along from other people, so by this point, I'd buy a huge selection of books to read.
That doesn't seem too bad to me.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So maybe you're not acquiring stuff, but you still have problems with keeping stuff.
Participant 020:
Right.
But I think that the impulse is still there.
If I had more financial security or something like that, it might be more of an issue.
But over my life, I've been able to somewhat control my spending and my hoarding by the fact that I was, even though I never earned a great deal, I was so afraid of ending up on the street that when my back balance would get below a certain point or my credit card would get above a certain point, I'd just stop buying for a while.
That fear was big enough to counter some of the worst of my hoarding impulses and buying what I don't need impulses.
