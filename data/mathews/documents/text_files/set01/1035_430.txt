Interviewer:
It sounds like your depression and your clutter are causing each other.
It sounds like on the one hand, you see depression as being the reason you're so cluttered, but on the other hand, the clutter is making your depression worse, because you're so hard on yourself about your inability to solve the problem of the clutter.
Does that sound right?
Participant 035:
Exactly.
Yep.
Interviewer:
It sounds like all that has gotten worse with COVID.
Participant 035:
Yeah.
It kind of has.
It's given me more time to take stock and I've made a few positive moves, but there's a whole lot more I can do.
I'm at a point where okay, this has got to stop.
This is ridiculous.
I can't turn into this, the weird woman who lives in that house.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 035:
Everything looks great on the outside, but as soon as you open that door, man, it's scary.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you're really ...
Yeah.
Participant 035:
I feel like okay, just keep going, Participant 035, you can get this sorted out.
Okay, quit making excuses.
Anyway.
Interviewer:
It almost sounds like-
Participant 035:
I'll plan things to make myself, to force me to take some action, like my son's coming over on Friday to deal with my smoke alarms.
I know I've got to have stuff more cleaned up, so that he can get into all the rooms to change everything out.
It's Tuesday, and this morning, I made a small start with pulling clothes, basically, with the clothes, I've got clothes in just about every closet in the house.
Right now, the closets are bursting at the seams.
I must get rid of that.
I've started piling up clothes, and I've just made two piles, things that can go to ...
It's a women's, for women's shelter, and things that can go to Goodwill, and forget about the consignment stuff, because I don't think people are out shopping.
I've started that out, so that I can get clothes off the clean and dry rack and into closets, and then deal with all the clothes that are sitting out here and there and everywhere.
Anyway.
That's ...
Interviewer:
Yes.
You create reasons for yourself to need to get organized, and that's what helps motivate you and push you forward.
Participant 035:
Yeah.
I try and ignore the fact that for me, Participant 035, you're worth doing this just for yourself to make you more comfortable.
I have to have an external pusher to do it.
Interviewer:
For the last-
Participant 035:
That's the way I am.
