Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So what would you say hoarding disorder looks like?
Participant 45:
Hoarding looks like, I mean, when you said that I just had the image of blackness. Hoarding looks like someone that is not truly alive, black like gangrene or something. There's a dead quality. Gangrene, I like that. That just popped into my head but it's like a deadness that keeps, if you don't amputate it, it keeps coming and killing more tissue and more of your body. It can win if you don't take action with hoarding. Is that the kind of image you were looking for or were you looking for something less symbolic?
Interviewer:
I mean, that's not what I was expecting, I guess but that's a very interesting way to put it and it makes me think, is that how you ... when you think about your behavior, is that how you feel also or do you feel differently?
Participant 45:
Oh no, I feel that I'm talking about myself here. 
Interviewer:
Oh, okay. 
Participant 45:
I'm not judgmental about other people who hoard at all and I know someone ... I've also tried some classes and there are actually people in worse shape than I am but mostly because I have more room and mostly because I've done so much reading on the subject and so much studying on it and I know what ... I kind of know the techniques, the salami technique, the little steps, doing something physical and getting your brain rested and then not doing too big a project at once, something where you can get rewarded. I've done a lot of work to know how to do it, it's just getting myself to do what I know how to do. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So, it seems like you're pretty knowledgeable, what things have you read? Are they mainly articles, books, or scientific journals? And like-
Participant 45:
I mentioned Buried in Treasures. Anything Tolin has written I try to get ahold of. I have huge number of books on organization and I ... so they're not scientific, per se, but I will read anything on the subject that comes my way, whatever if it's popular publications or magazine articles or if it's scientific I'll read that, what the data is on it and as I say, this is what I work on with a therapist, as well. 
Interviewer:
So where did you get these? Are people sending these to you or are you looking them up yourself?
