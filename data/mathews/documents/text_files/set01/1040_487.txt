Interviewer:
Have you ever had any-
Interviewee:
I cleaned up my parents' house when they died.
Mother moved into a assisted living.
And cleaning up that business was a mess, and they do not want to go through the same thing that I had to go through.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
They don't want to have to clean or go through that.
Okay.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
And like I say, I'm 79, so I'm not old.
Old is 80.
I'm getting there.
I'm going to have to reappraise that whole business.
Interviewer:
Have you ever had any conflicts with people close to you about hoarding disorder or clutter problems?
Interviewee:
Well, my husband just generally around the house.
I also have a problem when there isn't a way.
Sometimes I will start to put it in the nearest [INAUDIBLE] that's available.
I don't get it where it's supposed to be.
Like just this morning I had raisins for my Cheerios, and I'd gotten the package down, got the raisins.
And instead of putting it away where it was supposed to, I started to put it where it was because I got the raisins for when I make oatmeal.
Wanted to put it right handy in a little container.
I wanted to put it up with the salt and the oatmeal, and my husband said [INAUDIBLE] and he harrumphed and "[NAME]?" And I looked at what I had and what I was doing and promptly put it where it was supposed to be.
Interviewer:
It sounds like there's some conflict with your husband wanting things in a specific place.
Interviewee:
Like I say, he's on the spectrum.
OCD, very precise, very smart.
PART 2 OF 4 ENDS
Interviewer:
Got you.
Interviewee:
Very smart.
But it's not OCD, it's COD.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Interviewee:
If that makes sense.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
So you mentioned that there are, especially you mentioned in the back room and in your sewing room, there's a lot of stacks and there's these aisles that you can walk through.
You also mentioned that there's some stuff in your living room.
Would you say that that describes your house as a whole, or are there certain areas that have less stuff than others?
Interviewee:
Certain areas have less stuff.
I have a standard.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Nothing will peek out of a closet or of a drawer.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
If you close the drawer, you shouldn't be able to tell what's in there.
The other thing I have the standard is, is it safe?
Is someone going to slip on it?
Is it a fire hazard?
There will be no fire hazards and no one's going to slip on it.
Interviewer:
So making sure things are safe and making sure things are tucked away within closets and in drawers is important to you.
