Interviewer:
Okay. So, kind of the opposite of that first question is what do you consider trash?
How do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Participant 009:
Well, I've been going...
Things like books that I know I'm not going to read again, I've been working with that.
A lot of paper that I'm thinking, oh my gosh, I just haven't bothered to get rid of it.
I don't need it, so a lot of old papers and things like that I need to get rid of that I [INAUDIBLE] and I'm feeling less attachment to anything like that.
I have no problem getting rid of... what am I trying to think?
Actually, well shoes are something that I have no problem getting rid of if they're not comfortable and I don't like the way they look on my feet, and that's gotten more important to me as I've gotten older is that they need to be comfortable, so that's what I'm...
But I have this thing about trash as opposed to can I recycle this?
This things of is it something that I should throw away or it's bad for the environment to throw away stuff so I need to find a way to recycle whatever it is and then I get stuck with not getting rid of something because I'm thinking, "Oh, well I need to take this next step and figure out how to recycle whatever it is."
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, it sounds like when you have the most difficulty getting rid of something is actually getting rid of it because you can't decide if it needs to be thrown away or recycled or donated?
Participant 009:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So, when you think about all your possessions, what is the most precious item in your house?
Participant 009:
Oh. Well, something that I definitely wouldn't want to lost in a fire or something would be my picture albums.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, would happen if you did lose them, say in a fire or someone through them out on accident?
Participant 009:
Well, it wouldn't be a disaster because I actually... my favorite pictures I have scanned, so they're in the cloud somewhere so I could go see those again, so that wouldn't be a total disaster.
In fact, it's funny because right now we're having all these fires in California and I was reading about people losing their houses and I remember years ago talking to this woman who lost her house in a fire and she said she suddenly felt free CROSSTALK all this stuff.
It occurred to me that it might be very freeing if you suddenly had a disaster and lost all your stuff, so.
Interviewer:
I guess, yeah.
There's no one to blame.
It was a natural disaster.
Participant 009:
Yeah.
Right.
In actuality, if I think about it there is no one thing that would really be devastating if I lost it.
I just need to let that sink in.
