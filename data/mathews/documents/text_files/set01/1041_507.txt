Participant 041:
I still watch it now.
Sorry.
Since moving back to Florida, I watch it even more.
I've always been watching Hoarders for years, but then it really picked up when [INAUDIBLE], "Okay," and my mom was really pushing me to the point of aggravation, like it was getting on both of our nerves because I'm like, "I want to do it this way," and she's like, "No, I know how you are.
You have to get rid of this stuff, or else you're just going to have it."
Even now, she's like, "Okay, you still have too much stuff," but just more so once picking up once I, like the last two weeks I was in Maryland and then now I watch at least three or four episodes of Hoarder, or cleaning YouTube accounts.
Like [INAUDIBLE] on YouTube.
Well that's her Instagram name, but I'll watch different cleaning videos of people cleaning their home and organize their home.
I watch at least 10, 15 videos of those type a week just to keep myself focused, even though I could do a lot more.
It's just to keep me focused.
I watch it a lot.

Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 041:
Yeah, sorry.
Interviewer:
No, you're good.
Participant 041:
I talk a lot.
Interviewer:
No, you're fine.
I mean that's what we want.
We want to understand your beliefs and your ideas, and how you manage this.
So this next section's not really most people's favorites because it's talking about distress and the emotional side of it.
Participant 041:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So does your behavior upset you at all?
Participant 041:
Sometimes.
When we moved, it was frustrating having to get rid of a lot of stuff because I don't have the space for it.
Some things I'm like, "Man, why did I donate that?" I'm thinking of a couple of things I donates and I shouldn't have, and then also with the move, some of the stuff my mom accidentally donated that I wanted to keep, and my mom was like, "Oh well."
I'm like, "Come on.
If I donated your stuff by accident, you wouldn't like it," but we've collectively both donated each other's stuff by accident since the move, so ... [INAUDIBLE] was aggravating, but that's the only thing.
I feel like when I move on my own, it won't be like that.
I feel like any time you live with someone else, there's pros and cons.
