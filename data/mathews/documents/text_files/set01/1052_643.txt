Participant:
An example could be in this recent COVID lockdown, I spent a number of months back at home instead of this workplace.
And, um, I found that the actual work items I was handling were more suited to one- or two-hundred square feet of office space rather than four- or six-hundred feet of workspace, and that I didn’t need to refer to nearly any of the stuff that’s in here., I’m in my office space today, and I’ve been walking through the wreckage and possibly putting paper into the recycling bin.
Interviewer : Okay.
So, you kind of moved away from your things and your workspace for a while, and it made you realize that you didn’t necessarily need all of them.
Participant:
It was more apparent.
And, I, uh, in the course of clearing a way to my desk I put a number of things into the recycling.
Interviewer : Okay.
So, in terms of your problems with clutter, have you every sought to change this behavior?
Like have you ever gone to a professional for help?
Participant:
I hired a young woman to come in for a couple of days— probably 15 years ago— to clear and clean.
And, um, I still have some of her labels on my walls.
But, it was incomplete.
An incomplete effort.
Interviewer : Okay.
So, you’ve never had any sort of traditional therapy or counseling for it?
Participant:
No. Interviewer : Okay.
And, so, when you had this person come in to help you organize, did this cause you any distress?
Participant:
No, I don’t think it caused me distress.
That occurred in conjunction with, uh, I participated in a 12-step recovery group.
And, um, part of the benefit of that process is uncomfortable truths.
Part of addressing recovery is to address uncomfortable truths in an inventory process, and you’re inventorying stuff in your head as well as stuff in your life.
And, um, so I’ve been trying to apply those principles to, um, not just stuck in my head but stuck in my life.
Interviewer : Right.
So, can you tell me a little bit more about that 12-step process you went through?
Participant:
It occurs in church basements usually.
One of the names is Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.
And, um, people meet who have a common problem and common desire to uh, an unmedicated life.
Interviewer : Okay.
So, it was intended to help you with the hoarding, but you underwent that activity with bringing someone else in as part of the process to help you with that?
Participant:
Yes.
There’s an analogous or uh, a coincidental benefit to cleaning up my life, included also cleaning up my space.
Interviewer : Gotcha.
And, so, after you had that person come in and help you organize, how long did things stay organized?
Or how long until things started to get bad again with the clutter?
