Interviewer:
Okay. So, what are you collections that make of most of the stuff that you have in storage?
What is it?
Is it a lot of photos, a lot of books, or...
Participant 009:
In storage or collections, because I actually have... I collect things that I display.
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
Well, yeah, let's hear about both.
Participant 009:
Such as I have a collection of egg cups and I've limited myself by the display space I have in the kitchen.
So, I have egg cups, I have elephants that I've collected over the years, all these figurines of elephants that are on display.
I have art and things like that that's displayed around the house in different places, so that's what I consider a collection.
Did that answer your question?
Interviewer:
So, then what is in all the boxes that you have in your garage?
Participant 009:
Oh, the boxes?
Oh, okay.
Art supplies, extra dishes, stuff for doing rituals because I do seasonal rituals with a spiritual group, costumes, loads of scarfs.
I've got collections, well I did say art supplies, right?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 009:
Craft supplies, things for when I used to do theater, so music, and I mean sheet music but also CDs and things like that, and then some electronics that support that that are probably way out of date like CD players and recorders for when I would record myself singing for classes and things like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, when you think about all of these items that you have, how would you choose between them if you had to get rid of something?
Participant 009:
I would probably go through and which ritual objects do I still use, well, and of course right now all of that's in advance because of Covid, go through my sheet music and those kind of songs I don't do anymore, give this to somebody, go through the old electronics and just dump all of that because now with GarageBand and all of that I don't use that stuff anymore.
And then definitely I need to go through all those boxes of pictures and throw away things that I don't want to keep and scan anything that I think is an image I'd like to look at again, and I don't need to keep both a scan and a photo if I'm not going to frame it or something, so.
And the costumes, probably the costumes I should go through and call there and pull out things that I'm not going to wear again.
