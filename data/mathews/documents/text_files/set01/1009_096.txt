Interviewer:
Okay. How has Covid affected your difficulties discarding? Has it made it better or has it made it worse?
Participant 009:
Well, right now I feel like I can't go... I was sort of in the mode of, okay, I'm going to start taking things... I can't get to The Salvation Army to make donations. There was a place I could take old books to the public library, the location is closed. I don't want to go to the dump in my car because I don't want to go out, so. I did, shortly before this happened, I called for what we call a large garbage pickup where they'll pick up big stuff. So, I had gotten rid of some stuff out of the garage before all this happened, but all those services are pretty much gone right now. So, I'm just kind of feeling like I'm in limbo.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, you can't really shop but you also can't really get rid of anything because everything's shut down?
Participant 009:
Right. So, unless it'll fit in my garbage or my recycle bin it's kind of hard to get rid of stuff. 
Interviewer:
So, since you've been having kind of a difficult time have you found any helpful coping mechanisms? 
Participant 009:
Well, one thing, I'm doing a lot of these family Zoom meetings that I set up which is kind of nice because I'm pulling in extended family. I'm having a lot of calls with my dad, video calls. My choir is doing Zoom rehearsals which are kind of weird because you can't sing together because the internet doesn't allow you to do that. All you end up with echo and all that stuff, but we've figured out a way around it so I've been having choir rehearsals once a week, which is nice because then we can see each other and support each other. So, we're finding new ways to support each other, and I'm trying to be more creative with my cooking because I'm having to do more cooking than I used to. We're not going out at all so I'm trying to come up with new recipes and things like that, so that's been kind of fun. For a while, I was trying to find new places to walk so I would get in my car and go to a new park or a new section of a park that I'd never been to once a week and walk somewhere where I had a different viewpoint because it got very tedious, you know, the same streets all the time. But it's like this last two weeks have been really difficult with the fires because it's like you can't get out and walk, so.
Interviewer:
Yeah. So, you're actually just sitting at your house all day.
Participant 009:
I'm trying to watch inspiring movies at night.
