Participant 008:
And it certainly helps, you know, over the years, it has helped me to get rid of stuff to have to go through multiple moves.
Interviewer:
That's good.
Participant 008:
So, it's kind of the prep.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Participant 008:
Let's spend six months getting rid of a little bit of stuff and then one month moving the rest of it.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Truly. How does your wife feel about your hoarding problem?
Participant 008:
She generally avoids talking about it with me.
Interviewer:
Okay. So ...
Participant 008:
She's aware of it, and I try to do my best that it doesn't impact her. I'm sure she sees the stress, but she doesn't say a lot about it.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, she kind of avoids it, kind of steps around the stuff. Has she ever tried to talk to you about it?
Participant 008:
A little bit. The hardest thing for me is my dad had left ... His hoarding was books. He had a collection ...
Interviewer:
Bugs?
Participant 008:
... Or on the order of 10,000 books.
Interviewer:
Oh, books. Got it.
Participant 008:
Which is an enormous number, and I've been trying to catalog them. That's been a very slow process. Kind of in my mind, I have this idea that once I've cataloged them that I can get rid of them. And I've only gotten through maybe about 3,000 of them, and I was able to give about 1,500 of them, that were math, technically oriented, math and physics books to one of the universities here later this year. To their ...Libraries don't want books anymore, but the math department actually took them.
Interviewer:
Got it. Okay. 
Participant 008:
So ...
Interviewer:
So, when you say catalog ...
Participant 008:
That actually felt really good.
Interviewer:
I'm sure that felt wonderful.
Participant 008:
I didn't have to throw them out.
Interviewer:
Right. How would you feel if you didn't catalog the rest and you just got rid of them?
Participant 008:
It would feel really unpleasant. It would feel like I betrayed my dad in some sense.
Interviewer:
Sure. Do you think your dad would prefer you not have the distress and time spent doing all that?
Participant 008:
I'm sure he would, but it doesn't change how I feel about it.
Interviewer:
Totally. No, that makes sense definitely.
Participant 008:
I can speak logically about it, but I can't actually follow through on that. It doesn't change how I feel.
