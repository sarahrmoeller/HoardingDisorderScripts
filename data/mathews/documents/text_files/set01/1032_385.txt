Interviewer:
Okay, and do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 32:
Probably it would, that would be helpful.
So, I'll say yes for that one, yeah.
Interviewer:
And do you think this behavior is similar or different to your own?
Participant 32:
Oh, only the slightest bit of similarity but it's mostly different by far, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay, and it goes back to that bathroom situation and being able to find your...
You're able to find your things pretty easily without being late to things?
Participant 32:
Yeah, the essential things like wallet and car keys and that kind of thing to get to places on time, those I can find usually pretty readily because I mostly put them in the same place every time.
Occasionally I don't, so yeah.
Did I... I think I answered that question.
Interviewer:
Yes.
Okay, two more of these little situations.
So, John Doe has several stacks of papers that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future.
These stacks of papers occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom.
Before taking a shower he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.
Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.
So, do you think this is more hoarding disorder or more clutter problems?
Participant 32:
Oh, my.
That's a tough one to call.
I think I'm going to call that clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay, and why would you say clutter as opposed to more hoarding disorder?
Participant 32:
Maybe because it's more similar to what I do but I don't want to be a hoarder.
Because yeah, papers...
But I would never put papers in my shower or bathtub.
I cannot imagine that but whatever.
Interviewer:
Okay, and do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 32:
Boy, I don't know.
I'm thinking maybe I need to change my answer.
Maybe that is hoarding even though it's paper.
Hmm.
And so, yeah I guess, yes.
Both yes.
Both questions, yes.
Interviewer:
And then you did mention that this behavior is similar to your own because they were both paper.
But are there any other similarities that you were able to gauge?
Participant 32:
No, really it was just the paper part of it because yeah, I mean I have paper on lots of my horizontal surfaces.
But never...
Yeah, yeah, okay.
