Interviewee:
Are there any parts of your home that you don't use for their intended purpose? Do you have a bathroom maybe that you just use for storage?
Participant 012:
No. Well, our guest room, we use for storage but it's not so bad that when we do have a guest it's easily cleaned out and moved around. We use each room for what its intended purpose.
Interviewee:
Okay. How about your kitchen? Are you able to use the counter spaces and stuff or would you say it's cluttered? 
Participant 012:
It's cluttered. I mean, we have spots open to be able to do that but the counters are full.
Interviewee:
Okay. The general idea that I'm getting is that you just might have a few boxes in each room that makes it a little cluttered?
Participant 012:
Yeah and stuff on top, top of stuff on top of stuff. That kind of thing.
Interviewee:
Okay. Is it like mostly papers or is it furniture or are there just boxes of items like vases or bowls or something like that?
Participant 012:
Knick knacks. Yeah. All of the above. Everything. Papers. I'm going through those now. Books. Knick knacks that I've collected. Things that ... Well, from the various places I've worked that are just sitting on boxes on top of areas and that I haven't gone through. I don't want to deal with it. It's just a lot of knick knacks. A lot of dust collectors.
Interviewee:
All right. What about your bedroom? Is there stuff on your bed or are you able to use the bed and use the closet and everything like that?
Participant 012:
Yeah. Nothing on the bed. There are boxes on the floor. Closet's pretty full but everything does have a place and we can get around and everything.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Participant 012:
Our bureaus are covered.
Interviewee:
All right. What would you like your home to look like in an ideal world?
Participant 012:
Everything straight, a lot less of the knick knacks, although I don't know how I'm going to get rid of any of them because I like them all. Just more straightened up. Yeah. A lot narrowed down from what I've collected so that we can see them and enjoy them more.
Interviewee:
Okay. How important are your things for you to feel at home? 
Participant 012:
That's the problem. I like all the stuff. To me, I guess you would say it's pretty important. I can't decide what to get rid of because it makes up the home.
