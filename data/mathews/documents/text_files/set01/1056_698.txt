Participant:
Moving them from one place to another, from where I knew where everything was to temporarily I might not know where everything was until I had the opportunity to put it back where it belonged. And when I say where it belonged, to where I was accustomed to having it, and um, again, someone would come visit, the boxes would be missing, and then they would go away and the boxes would be moved back to where they needed to be.
Interviewer (38:38): So, is it important to you that your stuff kinda stays how you organized it, like in the room? So, you said that you would put things back after the person would leave?
Participant:
It is my preference that I know where my stuff is.
Interviewer (38:54): Right. So, that’s kind of how you like to organize, so that you can, you know, easily remember and recall where things are?
Participant:
Well, if someone says hmm, if we’re in a casual conversation and they say I believe I need a [inaudible] and I say, ooh, I have one of those. I know exactly where it is, give me a moment and I will get it. Yes, that is important to me.
Interviewer (39:22): Okay, so, utility and being able to find things really quickly. Alright. Okay, so, do you think it ever gets in the way of your daily life, or at any point in your life did it necessarily get in the way of your daily life to have stuff, or to have clutter?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer (39:42): Okay, and would anyone, like your significant other or you said you had a son, would they ever disagree with you?
Participant:
Um, I don’t think my son had any issues with things, but I’d say my significant other would disagree with me. But I claim that’s because she’s on the other end of the spectrum and she’s an OCD cleaner. 
Interviewer (40:13): Right.
Participant:
So, if she came to your house, and I’m assuming you’re not someone with hoarding tendencies, she would probably feel that you’re a hoarder.
Interviewer (40:22): Right. Understandable, yeah. So, for you then it’s never really gotten in the way of what you’ve really wanted? So, for you it’s never really had like a serious impact on your life?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer (40:35): Okay, so, also, I wanted to go back a little bit and talk about when you were younger. Did your tendencies look different? I mean, I’m assuming you maybe lived in a different space so maybe at different points in your life um, it kinda took different forms? Like I’m assuming you didn’t always have this particular garage or your office to keep things in. So, earlier in your life what did that maybe look like for you?
Participant:
Um, less space, less stuff.
