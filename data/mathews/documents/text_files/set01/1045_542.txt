I'm at the one end of the spectrum of slowness and she's at the opposite end for swiftness of throwing things away just so fast. Now she has a better knowledge of what she likes and doesn't like and I have to look at an object a really long time usually to know and get centered and slowly concentrate to figure out how I even feel about it and sometimes it takes days for a simple object. 
Well, that would never do. I mean 30 seconds is too long for her. So, yes, that was one example of a big problem because we had a huge amount of stuff to go through and then my mother had saved every little kind of ... like if you got yogurt in a little yogurt carton she saved every one. They were all washed and cleaned and stacked up but you can't imagine what was in those cabinets. I think it was everything that came in got washed and saved. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 45:
After her Alzheimer's kicked in and probably not everything but enough so that it was a challenge. And then that made it quadruply hard for me because my sister soon just abandoned the whole project, understandably but she abandoned the whole project and so then the very person that was least equipped and able to go through ... Same thing, they had 60 years or 70 years of things, back to the 30s. I have clothes here from the 30s.

Well, I think it's fair to say, she's a pretty critical person to begin with, the kind of person who can't tolerate a painting that's not even lined up exactly right on the wall. It just drives her insane. She has to go fix it immediately. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Okay. Are you still living in that same house and do you live alone there right now?
Participant 45:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 45:
Yes and yes. 
Interviewer:
And how would you describe the space? What does it look like inside?
Participant 45:
Very bad. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So would you-
Participant 45:
Seriously, I don't know if you've seen bad clutter situations I suppose. It's as bad as you can imagine I would say. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so there are parts through homes that you don't-
