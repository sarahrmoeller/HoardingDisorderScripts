Interviewer:
Right.
Could you describe a time where your problems with clutter got in the way of something that you really wanted?
Interviewee:
I think I wanted to entertain and have a pleasant experience, and it was so laden with stress about that, that I didn't have a good... I didn't enjoy myself, and I really wanted to have a successful, you know, social interaction with these people, and I don't think it was all that successful.
Interviewer:
Okay, and do your problems with clutter upset any of your loved ones?
I know you mentioned before that sometimes they just tell you to stop, and it's not as simple as that.
Interviewee:
Yeah, but he’s kind of learned not to because he doesn’t get good results when he does that.
Interviewer:
Right.
And are you referring to your husband?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So I know your husband has tried.
Has it impacted any of your relationships with other family members or your work?
Interviewee:
Could you hold on just one second?
Interviewer:
Yes, of course.
Interviewee:
Okay, I’m back.
Other people... um well, my sister has asked for a copy of a photograph, and I can't find it, but it’s not like a major life problem, but no.
Interviewer:
So nothing very serious, but it has caused some minor issues.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay, and would you like to change your behavior?
Interviewee:
I think so, yes.
Interviewer:
What ways would you want to change it?
Other than how you mentioned about organization and decreasing by about 20%, I think you said.
Interviewee:
I feel like the reason that I'm holding on to some of these things is because I haven't faced up to certain realities, you know, in my life, and I think it would be better if I had a more clear idea about things and wasn't in the act of hiding- hiding from my life.
So that would be a change, you know, theoretically, I would like to make, but I’m doubtful if I will ever be ready to make that, but I kind of wish I were, but I'm not sure I'm willing to do what I have to do to get that result.
Interviewer:
Okay, so more of like a lifestyle change, if anything.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, our last two sections are actually focused on the pandemic that's happening right now and how its impacted you.
So how has the COVID- 19 pandemic affected your life?
Interviewee:
Actually, you know, since I'm retired, it hasn't been great as other people.
I do feel very stressed out when I realize that there are other citizens of this country that are endangering everybody, including themselves.
I used to feel more safe around people in general, and now I feel like maybe 30% of the population are, you know, dangerous.
Interviewer:
That's understandable, and what specific behaviors have changed for you?
