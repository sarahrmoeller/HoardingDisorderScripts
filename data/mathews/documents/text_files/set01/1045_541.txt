Interviewer:
Okay. So how severe would you say your behavior is now and do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Participant 45:
I definitely believe my behavior's a problem.
I think I'm an eight to a nine on a scale of 10.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And so when you said that when you were younger you didn't have many items, so you didn't ever have any problems pickup up after yourself or you just didn't grow up with much at all so that it just didn't happen?
Participant 45:
Well, it's hard to know.
I think I don't recall having trouble picking up after myself but I think it's because I didn't have much to pick up.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 45:
And I don't think I developed really good organizational things but I have things ... I have many things back from, easily back from late teens and I'm 73.
So these things are very old.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you ever sought to change this behavior as you got older?
Have you ever gone to professional help?
Participant 45:
Oh, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 45:
Yes.
I have been working with therapists on it and I started ...
It's usually the first thing that I bring up.
Very few therapists that I've worked with have an expertise in this and they almost all felt that there were other problems that resulted in the hoarding behavior that if we solved those problems then the hoarding would improve.
So we didn't work head on ... I think cognitive behavior therapy is probably the more effective thing to do for hoarding but it wasn't ... it hasn't been very much of that.
Although the person I work with now is much better than anybody that I've had up until now.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How did you find that person?
Participant 45:
Ironically, through grief counseling and she was quite young.
In fact, she, at the time, wasn't licensed as a therapist and I remember thinking, "What could this young lady know about grief?" But she's incredibly wise and more capable than anyone else I've worked with.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So how does your family and friends feel about your behavior?
Have you ever had conflicts with them or maybe a landlord even?
Participant 45:
My father was probably sort of a hoarder, not too bad but somewhat and then my mother became a hoarder, only after she developed Alzheimer's.
So she was kind of a check on his behavior.
But once she started exhibiting behavior, she no longer ... after she got Alzheimer's she could no longer check that.
I then moved into their house after they passed away, eventually I did and my sister came and we were going to go through the different rooms and it was impossible.
