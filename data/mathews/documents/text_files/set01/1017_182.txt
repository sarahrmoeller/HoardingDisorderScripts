Interviewer:
Would you say that being married to him has helped her behavior or is she hiding it?
Interviewee:
She's hiding it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Most definitely.
Interviewer:
What about, can you think back to when you were married, was your husband understanding of it or did he have the same behavior?
He was understanding of it?
Interviewee:
Yes, he had no problems with my saving a moving ticket from going to the movies, or finding something that had meaning to me, or bringing home books was never a problem for him.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Can you tell me a little bit more about your relationship with your oldest son, the one who you'd say is a minimalist?
Interviewee:
Okay.
You mean as far as his behavior?
How he reacts to me?
Interviewer:
Yeah, how he reacts to you?
Does he visit often or do you visit him often?
Interviewee:
He does not visit me because the house honestly isn't big enough for him and his family to come and visit because it's small.
But, before that when I lived in a house in the country that was the one he grew up in, he and his wife did visit.
They then moved to the Buffalo area, near where her parents are, and it's about a three hour drive for me to get there.
They do not come this way to visit, maybe but once or twice a year, and that's usually for a Christmas or an Easter, and we all get together at my daughter's house because it's big enough for everybody.
