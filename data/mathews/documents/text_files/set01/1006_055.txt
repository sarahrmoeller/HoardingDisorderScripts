Interviewer:
Good, okay. Have you tried doing that? Have you found any progress? Or is that something that you want to try to do?
Participant 006:
It's definitely what I want to try to do.
Interviewer:
Okay, good, good. I think that's actually all. Those are all the scenarios, and everything we had to go through. So if you don't want to add anything else, or anything that you have on your brain right now, I can end the recording.
Participant 006:
I think that's complete, after that last thing, yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 006:
I need to quit trying to emulate everything that I see.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah, no, that makes sense. Do you think that that friend, when she told you that, do you think that she's gotten better with not buying so much home décor things?
Participant 006:
I think she has, yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 006:
She never had quite the issue that I did, though.
Interviewer:
Yeah. If anything, you can still apply the same mechanisms, and it doesn't mean that it won't work for you. Even if, it doesn't matter if her problem is on a much smaller scale.
Participant 006:
Right, right. Well when she said that, then I got to thinking that yes, that probably would help me. Because I see things and I think, I'm going to go try that. There's another crafty or woodworking item that I want to do, which takes time away from what I really should be doing.
Interviewer:
Yeah. When you work on these projects, do you normally complete them?
Participant 006:
No. Because that's the other issue. I have all these grand ideas, then I get started and I lose interest.
Interviewer:
Okay, okay, yeah. You lose interest. Okay. Do you think that happens to you a lot?
Participant 006:
Yes.
Interviewer:
All right.
Participant 006:
I have several unfinished projects right now in my home, even though I've been home all these months and could easily have completed them. That's another issue. It's adding a lot of extra stress and guilt that I haven't used my time wisely.
Interviewer:
Do you think it's because some of the projects you take on are really big and require a lot of steps? Do you think that they were maybe smaller projects with less steps, you'd be more prone to finishing them and feeling a little bit more satisfied?
Participant 006:
Maybe. I'm not too sure. Because it seems like I can't actually start something and complete it, anything.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. If that's everything you have on your mind right now, I can go ahead and end the recording, if you'd like?
Participant 006:
Okay, okay.
Interviewer:
All right. Let me end it.
