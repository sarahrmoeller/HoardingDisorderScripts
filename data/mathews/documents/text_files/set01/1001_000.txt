Participant 1:
Okay.
Interviewer:
All right. So could you please describe your clutter problems? How long has this been going on?
Participant 1:
Oh my gosh. A long time. I mean, I get lots and lots of mail. I try and go through it and throw things away. I'd say over 20 years.
Interviewer:
Okay. Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. How severe would you say this behavior is now?
Participant 1:
Mildly. Moderately severe. Moderately. Yeah.
Interviewer:
And do you think this behavior is a problem?
Participant 1:
Well, yeah. Kind of. Because that's why I'm participating in the study because I'd like to get tips on how to stop doing this. You ever heard of somebody called the FlyLady?
Interviewer:
I have not.
Participant 1:
Oh you haven't? She's a person that deals with clutter. People... Yeah. The FlyLady. And there's a website. And people go to her. And it's basically based on little steps type of thing where you make little steps. People who have been depressed for a long period of time. People who have gone through a death. People who have gone through bad times in their life that that's the last thing they want to do is clean their house and clean up the clutter. So-
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. Have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Participant 1:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Have you gone to a professional or CROSSTALK-
Participant 1:
No.
Interviewer:
No. Okay.
Participant 1:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. And all right. Perfect. Thank you. That's good. How do your friends and family feel about your behavior?
Participant 1:
They don't know about it because I don't have them over. I mean, my husband and our house, he deals with it. He just deals with it. But my house is kind of unfinished because I have clutter all over the place because I go between two different places where I'm never in the same place long enough. I don't live in one spot. I live in a couple of spots.
