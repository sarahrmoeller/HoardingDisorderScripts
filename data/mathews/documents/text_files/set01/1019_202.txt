Participant 019:
I think one of the major parts of my life was that our house burned down, and I became a general contractor in rebuilding that house at the age of about 35 I think. '81, I'm 46, 35, yeah. So I recognized that I didn't have enough money to build the house with a contractor, so I decided to marshal my friends and myself, so I really delved into how to save resources and do things yourself. 
Interviewer:
So it was a defining moment for you to lose all of your possessions, what was that like for you as somebody who is a saver?
Participant 019:
It did not bother me. I said, "The past is past and I've now got a new project." 
Interviewer:
So you took on rebuilding the house yourself as a major part of your life. 
Participant 019:
Yeah, right. For about a year. But that was psychologically a very important moment in my development. 
Interviewer:
So how did that contribute to the changes in your saving behavior?
Participant 019:
It opened up other realms of areas that I needed to save for. I found new tools that were necessary. Another part of my life was that at one point I was a mechanic in autos, so the tools that you repair autos are part of my realm. So I have dabbled in many mechanical things, so that's contributed to the saving element. Just being willing to take on so many projects. 
Interviewer:
Right. So you started to save tools and things related to those jobs, to help you to be able to rebuild your home and to help you to do projects like that in the future. 
Participant 019:
And in a resourceful way, by not having other people coming and do it, but do it myself. 
Interviewer:
What is it like for you now? How would you say that your saving behavior is now?
Participant 019:
It's a challenge, because I've gotten to the age of 74 where I can no longer want to do those things, but I find that I haven't used the energy to just go through them and say, "Okay, I'll never use that, it's useless." As an example, I have some tools that my father passed down to me, and so I have trouble a little bit in deciding which of those things might be interesting to keep, just because of the memories I have from him. 
Interviewer:
So some of the things you keep are related to usefulness, but also you keep things because they have sentimental value. 
Participant 019:
Yes.
