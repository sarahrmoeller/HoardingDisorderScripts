Interviewer:
When you think about the term hoarding disorder, is it a term that you identify with? What does hoarding disorder look like and how is it the same or different from your behavior?
Participant 019:
I think that I have clutter disorder, I don't think I have hoarding. In other words, hoarding, I think of it being in love with things and acquiring, just wanting to get more of the same thing. Shopping, wanting to spend more and more. Almost blindly not being able to stop a collection, compulsiveness. I don't identify as being compulsive, or that compulsive. 
Interviewer:
So it sounds like there's a couple of elements, one is this wanting things for the sake of owning things, and that's not really how you operate at all. It sounds like you save things for a totally different reason that's not even related to the things themselves. From our earlier conversation, it even sounds like it comes from a place of wanting to use less, because you're trying to reuse, so that's part of it. Then there's also this extreme compulsive behavior that you don't see in yourself, like the need for things. 
Participant 019:
Let me make a point to you that I know of people who, in my life that I've come upon, who have hoarding and shopping. My daughter just couldn't stop her shopping, and she ran up tens-of-thousands of dollars in debt in credit cards, ruined her credit rating, because she just couldn't stop acquiring more things. I don't have that. My brother's ex-wife had a shopping disorder. 
Interviewer:
So you really don't have the acquiring component of hoarding at all, you don't go out and get stuff or over-buy. The way that you feel connected to the term hoarding disorder is by saving, and even then, it sounds like the kind of saving and the compulsive nature of it really doesn't fit with how you see yourself.
Participant 019:
I think there is compulsion, and that is to save. Saving is a compulsion. It's not realistic to save all these things, and it's not realistic to not go through these things and reevaluate and based on current circumstances, what has changed and what needs to be cleaned up. So there's the element of being stuck. 
Interviewer:
Where have you heard about hoarding disorder? Where do you get information about it or have you ever gotten information about it or heard anything about it as a disorder?
Participant 019:
No, I haven't. I haven't studied it much, because I don't identify much with it. I think that when I volunteered to become ... I guess there's a University of San Francisco ...
Interviewer:
Research study. 
Participant 019:
Research study, and I'm part of that. Then I think that somehow the University of Florida, your organization thought that maybe some of my answers might qualify me in the hoarding study. Then I started to think, I started to look at what types of activities hoarders have, what difficulties they have, and I said, "No, I'm not that extreme." 
Interviewer:
What sorts of places did you look for that information? Where were you looking?
Participant 019:
I think on the internet, probably looked on the internet for hoarding. But it hasn't become part of my constant, it's not on my radar right now. 
Interviewer:
That makes sense. That's most of the questions.
