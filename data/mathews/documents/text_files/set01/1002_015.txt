Interviewer:
All right. Okay, so my first question would be, what term would you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 2:
Probably clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay, clutter...problems.
Participant 2:
I mean, it's both, I see them as two separate but similar issues.
Interviewer:
All right, perfect. The next part is more of a conversation, so I'll just ask you questions for you to answer. Feel free to ask questions if you need clarification, and if any questions make you at all uncomfortable, let me know, you do not need to answer them, okay?
Participant 2:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Interviewer:
Okay, so can you can you please describe your clutter problems? How long has this been going on?
Participant 2:
Probably since I was a kid, I've always been... I'd always just start with probably procrastination. I probably have, every once a year, or once every six months, I do one major cleaning weekend, whatever, and get it all nice and neat. That lasts for about a week, and then just its gets all messed up again. But when I was in high school, I got into a car accident and my back got injured, and so I have a lot of back pain. It makes it hard for me to do household chores, and things like that.
Interviewer:
For sure, I'm sorry about that.
Participant 2:
Part of it is just health reasons, and then I also have some depression, so some of it's mood. Because I do have some pain management stuff. Some things are managed but, other things are just mood, so I say it's half and half.
Interviewer:
Okay, all right, thank you. For the next question I was going to ask, how severe would you say that this behavior is now? Do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Participant 2:
I mean, I'm mostly functional, I work full-time. I don't really have a social life, but that's related to my health and stuff, but it is still a problem.
Interviewer:
Okay, have you ever sought to change this behavior? Have you gone to a professional to help for this behavior or no?
Participant 2:
No.
Interviewer:
Could you tell me why?
Participant 2:
I never really thought about it being so much of mental thing before, it's just a laziness thing.
Interviewer:
Okay, I understand. All right, how do your family and friends feel about this behavior? Have you ever had conflicts with people close to you about the behavior?
Participant 2:
Yeah, lots of things, arguments with parents, and things like that. They sometimes spent the long weekends helping me with getting it back together, and then only to have me get it all messed up again.
