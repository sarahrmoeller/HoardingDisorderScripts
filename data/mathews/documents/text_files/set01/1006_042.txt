Okay. As you know, this study's investigating individual's values and beliefs relating to hoarding disorders. First, I want to know what term you prefer when we're talking about difficulty with clutters and difficulty discarding. For example, some people like to address it as hoarding, other people say cluttering, other people say organizational problems. Do you have any term that you prefer?
Interviewee:
No. I'm all of them.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Whatever you like.
Interviewer:
Okay. So I can use hoarding, and that'll be okay with you?
Interviewee:
Sure.
Interviewer:
Okay, and more time for yourself, and fun? Yeah. Okay. Now, that's the first half, congrats, we did it. Now, the second half, first is going to be more of an introduction about behavior and treatment seeking. If you can please describe your hoarding and how long it's been going on.
Interviewee:
Well I'm not sure. I've been thinking about this a lot. I probably had a tendency throughout my life to get things because I lacked so much for so long. But I didn't probably really start until maybe 20 years ago. I would say that I was in my mid 50's, my children moved out, left me completely alone. I was lonely, I was working two jobs and tired, and finally had some disposable income. I would start thrift shopping and grabbing things that I thought would make my life better. That's probably about where it started. It's probably been a good 20 years.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. How severe would you say this behavior is now?
Interviewee:
It's better now, because I reached the point where I am tired and want it done. I've been working on disposing of things, but I'm having a great deal of emotional trouble letting go.
