Okay, um, and I know that you mentioned that there's papers pretty much in every part of the home. But are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way they were intended, like other than like your stove and kitchen. Are there papers and just pretty much every room?
Participant:
Probably not in the bedroom. I don't really; that’s mostly cluttered with clothes. Other than that…Yeah. 
17:40 Interviewer:
Yeah. What about your bathrooms?
Participant:
I have one bathroom which is actually pristine. There's nothing in that bathroom. Nothing at all except the tub, the toilet, and the sink and a medicine chest with nothing but like toothbrush and toothpaste. I don’t know why. 
18:01 Interviewer:
So you said that you have to navigate your certain way in order to walk through the home

Mm hmm. Okay. Um, so now we're going to move on to our section about value. So, when you think about your possessions. What makes them valuable?

Probably the memories. I know it sounds silly but people who say that my house is cluttered continue to give me things. Like they come over and it's not [unclear]…  What the hell did you do with my lamp. Really. My best friend who's constantly “oh my gosh.” She constantly gives me things I'm thinking, well, what do you want to do. I like that stuff, but it's everywhere.

Right like, like I had soup for lunch that can that went well. It was one of those cans that you can’t recycle that and the in the garbage just came. I ran after the truck that went off with the garbage. See that I don't. 90% of what I throw out; I don't have much garbage, most of what I have is recycling.

Mm hmm. Okay. And what is the most precious item in your house for you?
Participant:
Can it be the dog or is that ridiculous?
