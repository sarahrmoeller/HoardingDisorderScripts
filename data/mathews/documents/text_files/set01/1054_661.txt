Interviewer: Okay. So, for the first part of the interview I’m gonna just ask you, um, preemptively, what term do you prefer when we’re talking about hoarding or clutter problems?
Is there a specific term you’d like to use?
Participant:
No, they’re all the same to me.
Interviewer: Okay, so is hoarding disorder okay, or hoarding?
Participant:
Mhmm.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, that concludes the first little part of the interview now.
The next part is going to be more like a conversation.
So, I'm going to ask you about a bunch of things related to your experience and your life reporting.
So, to start off, I want you to describe for me kind of your clutter problems, or your hoarding.
So, like, how long has this been going on?
And do you remember kind of how it started?
Participant:
Um.. when it started?
Um… darn, I’ve always had the problem.
Interviewer: Okay.
Participant:
You know, I’ve always had it.
When I, I— the company I worked for, how bad it was at work, is I kept things that were twenty, thirty years old.
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
Because I always thought I had a need for it.
Interviewer: So, you would say it’s kind of been ongoing throughout your life?
Participant:
Oh yes.
Interviewer: There wasn't like a particular point where it began?
Participant:
Um… no. Well, um, when I got, um, my first husband.
You know.
It, it started there.
Participant:
Okay.
And how did it start?
What kind of behaviors were you, you know, seeing in yourself when it began?
Participant:
Uh, just thinking I needed everything.
I find it useful at some time or another.
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.
And, so, how does your behavior at, you know, the beginning of when this all started kind of compare to how it is now?
Participant:
Um, I'm stressed all the time.
Interviewer: Mhmm.
Participant:
I’m stressed.
And, I have a bad habit of picking up something, picking up an item, and I end up putting it in another spot and I put it back.
It's just, it's ridiculous.
Interviewer: Right.
So, would you consider your behavior to be relatively severe, or would you say it's more moderate?
Participant:
I’m gonna say severe because I have a hard time giving things up.
Interviewer: Mhmm.
So you definitely consider it a problem in your own life?
Participant:
Oh gosh, it's a major problem.
Interviewer: Okay, so, can you kind of emphasize on that a little bit for me?
So, what in particular makes you think that it's a problem in your life?
