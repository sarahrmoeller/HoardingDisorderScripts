Interviewer:
That kind of leads into the next question, what does hoarding disorder look like?
How is it the same or different from your behavior?
Participant 013:
Well, I keep going back to those shows, which I don't watch, but I've seen snippets of or seen on commercials.
I've never been dirty, everything's clean.
I don't have bugs or piles of old newspapers or things that attract mice.
I picture hoarding as being you're just piling and piling stuff that is maybe useful, maybe not.
But maybe more like trash.
I picture hoarder as you won't get rid of anything.
Like I said, I'm happy to get rid of things that are truly trash, or things that I can find a home for.
Also, I picture hoarding as constantly bringing more stuff in and like I said, I've made a total consorted effort not to do that.
I try to be really careful, especially up here, normally in summers there's a lot of barn sales and auctions.
We do enjoy that, even my partner loves to go to them.
But instead and going be like, oh, that's a great deal, I have to get that.
Or oh, let me get that to sell on eBay or whatever, I try to be really careful either just not to get anything or only get that one thing that's really special or a really great deal or something I really love.
So I think the difference between hoarding and just not is not bringing in so much stuff.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 013:
Being able to get rid of stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think there's a way to tell that someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant 013:
I don't know.
Maybe if you were out shopping with them.
I don't know.
I guess it's all about what you're keeping.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 013:
I'm not sure.
Interviewer:
That's fine, that's fair.
That's just we're curious to see what people have to say about that.
You mentioned briefly before that you've seen little snippets of the show Hoarders and stuff like that.
Where else have you gotten information about hoarding disorder?
Where else have you heard of it?
Participant 013:
I don't know.
I think just that seems like that extreme and it's just like yikes.
I guess just people talking, like, "Oh, that person's a hoarder or that person."
Actually in driving around sometimes, especially up here, again it's a rural area, you see a lot of big old farm houses that just have so much stuff spilling out of them even.
People's porches and yards and everything is just so cluttered.
To me that's just like ew.
I just could never.
But then again, is that just as bad as me having a basement that looks like INAUDIBLE in the basement.
Then I think you shouldn't be critical of those people.
If anybody went in your basement, they'd be like yikes.
I mean it's a little better now, like I said.
So yeah, I guess just you have that idea in your head of what that is.
