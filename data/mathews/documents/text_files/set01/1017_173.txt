Interviewer:
Okay. And then, what geographic region best describes where you live in the U.S., Northeast, Midwest, South, or West?
Participant 17:
Northeast. 
Interviewer:
That's all right. So, this next section of the interview is a lot simpler, because it's more conversation style and it's broken into different little subsections. This first one's going to be talking about behavior and treatment seeking, can you please describe your collecting problems and how long they've been going on. 
Participant 17:
My collecting problems probably started as a result of being a child and having my mom take things that were important to me and not allowing me to have them, she would give them away or throw them away. So, I think that triggered me to start hiding and collecting things at a young age. When it got worse would probably be after I started having children because then their baby toys each held a memory for me and I took gazillions of photos. I have all these photos, but I'm realizing that was a problem because I was more focused on capturing all these things in pictures rather than enjoying the moment. 
I guess the next significant thing I would remember was when my mom was diagnosed with dementia, to the point where I could no longer physically take care of her because she was combative. I had to place her in a nursing home, and because my brother lives in California and I'm the only family member in the area, I was tasked with cleaning out my mothers house, and organizing and finding things, and mom was a hoarder. She had a three story house, every single closet was full of things. In one of the dens, I remember finding 73 coffee cans, one of which was honestly such an old coffee can that they didn't even make it anymore and it was considered an antique.
Ironically, I always have things that people need. My daughter said my granddaughter's class was doing a project and needed coffee cans and I had more than enough to surprise, obviously one of the first graders with a coffee can. But, it was tedious going through things because nothing was labeled, I did not know the significance of it. When my children left home and I was alone, I was widowed very, very young, I tried to find meaning in collecting things, it gave me a way to meet up with people who had similar interests or collections, and then it got plain overwhelming.
