Participant 019:
Studiers are probably not necessarily a normal control group. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, no. For sure. That's true. We are going to do a normal control group as well, but what we're trying to see is, do people, do doctors and patients have the same ideas about these problems? If we're asking people to think about their clutter problems as an issue that they should take up with their doctor, how is their doctor thinking about it and how are they thinking about it, and can we maybe use this research to help to understand how to bring those two groups of people together?
Participant 019:
Great. Interesting, okay. It might improve the therapy involved. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, exactly. But we understand that we're not interviewing exclusively people who have hoarding disorder, the behaviors fall in a spectrum. So I just want to start off the conversation, as long as you're okay to get started, with asking you how you would describe your own place on that kind of spectrum of clutter problems and hoarding disorder. How do you consider that for yourself?
Participant 019:
I regard myself as a longtime person who saves, and who is very, quite varied in my interest, my do-it-yourself interest. My hoarding is generally in the area of things that I do to fix the house. I built, I was part of building this house, so I'm involved in everything from plumbing to electricity to painting, every part of the house, I get involved, fixing up. Another area of my problem is papers. I have a concept, and I have for a long time, a concept that there are elements of value in information that I forget, that I may want to come back to, to refresh myself. As such, my inbox and my email is quite voluminous. I use it to go back and refresh myself on some piece of information that I had forgotten. So saving is in my nature. 
Interviewer:
So we'll talk about you as a saver. 
Participant 019:
Okay.
