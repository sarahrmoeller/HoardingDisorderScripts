Participant 006:
There's a lot of it that I look at and I think, oh I wanted to do that with that, maybe I'll get around to that. Well I never do get around to these things.
Interviewer:
Okay. You feel like you've had more time to organize and de-clutter, but you haven't taken advantage of it?
Participant 006:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay, all right. How has COVID impacted your overall physical health?
Participant 006:
Well, part of it is the wildfires, I'm in California. Part of it is the wildfires. We have ash falling daily. The doctor advised do not go out and walk. I usually walk for a couple of miles a day. But I've been pretty much stuck in the house, especially the last month.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Participant 006:
With COVID, I live in a neighborhood where a lot of people walk. So I was going out very early in the morning to avoid a lot of people. Because a lot of people around here are not wearing masks. I was going out very early. Well then with the wildfires and all, I've kind of quit walking at all, and I feel very isolated now.
Interviewer:
No, yeah, of course. This has affected your overall health, your mental health and wellbeing, you would say as well?
Participant 006:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. How has it affected you or your family financially?
Participant 006:
Well, I'm retired, so it really hasn't affected me. My children are all able to work from home, so it hasn't affected them yet, totally.
Interviewer:
Yeah, good, yeah. Are there any specific techniques in this era that you've found helpful?
Participant 006:
No, I don't know. I don't know exactly how to answer that. I'm moving more to audiobook. I'm working in my yard more. I do have, luckily, a backyard that I can escape to where no one else is around.
Interviewer:
Would you say that that brings you comfort more than your items, for example?
Participant 006:
Actually, yes, it does.
Interviewer:
Good, yeah. You have something to do and put your hands on and stuff.
Participant 006:
Yeah. Yeah. Just the time to be able to focus on more serene things has helped. And I have done a few of the craft things that I wanted to do. But then, what stops me there is that I have to look for things through the piles, and that's another thing that's irritated me, that I really need to get rid of things so I can get to the stuff that I want. I don't know if that makes sense.
Interviewer:
No, yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense. Would you say your motivation has stayed the same from before COVID to now, in terms of seeking help for hoarding?
Participant 006:
I think it's gotten better. I think my motivation has increased.
Interviewer:
Okay, good.
Participant 006:
I'm still not there.
