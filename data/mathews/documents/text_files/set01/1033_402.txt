Interviewer:
We'll move onto the next one.
I'm guessing based on the fact that you said that you would say that he's fairly normal that you don't believe that this person should try to change their behavior or that they require treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 33:
No, I don't think so.
Interviewer:
The next one again is with Mr. John Doe.
He has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.
He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he'll need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy every room.
Before entering his bathroom, he most remove several stacks of boxes.
His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.
Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.
He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
Participant 33:
I think he has a hoarding disorder.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think that he should try to change his behavior?
Participant 33:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Should he see a psychiatrist or a psychologist to try to...
Participant 33:
I guess if... I don't know.
I feel like we overuse perhaps psychologists.
I think we're capable of doing a lot more on our own than we think.
I don't know.
It's very hard for me to recommend to someone.
I think whether you should see a psychologist or not is something that someone personally has to come to on his own.
If I were him, maybe I would seek a psychologist if it...
It sounds pretty bad, but I feel really uncomfortable telling other people they need psychiatric help.
Interviewer:
That's fair.
If you were in his situation, you said you might choose to see one.
Participant 33:
INAUDIBLE might be necessary.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How, again, is this either similar or different to what you would describe your own clutter problems to be?
Participant 33:
I think INAUDIBLE what my clutter problems are, it sounds a lot worse than anything.
At least I can move around in my house.
My clutter is not actually typically in the way of anything.
