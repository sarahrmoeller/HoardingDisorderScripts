Interviewer:
Why?
Why has it had that effect?
Interviewee:
It's partly because I'm feeling like why was I limiting myself from enjoying a lot of these things that people around me enjoy, good food and stuff?
But it's also because I'm spending so much less that I actually have a little bit of more available income, not a lot, because I live pretty close to the poverty level, but enough-
Interviewer:
It stopped you from-
Interviewee:
... so that I let myself buy a piece of pie or something like that, that I might not normally buy.
You know?
Interviewer:
Totally.
It gives you a little bit of extra room to indulge.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I'm also doing more using up the food that I have, so I'm trying not to let my refrigerator get so crammed that I have food rotting because I can't remember it's there.
I'm also, over the last few years, been paying a lot of attention to the climate and the whole issue of how much food people throw away, and I'm very conscious of that and those issues and of all the people out there who are hurting so badly, who don't have anything-
Interviewer:
So you-
Interviewee:
... who don't know where their next meal is going to come from.
Interviewer:
So you really don't want to waste.
Interviewee:
No. Uh-uh NEGATIVE.
I think-
Interviewer:
Do you think that plays into your urge to save, because you're so concerned about waste?
Interviewee:
Well, yeah, that's part of it, but my parents were not the you can't leave the table until you clean the plate kind of people.
They weren't.
But I have discovered in myself a certain kind of miserliness, I think, that's come from where I've put my resources.
A lot of people...
I've been invited to go out to lunch with people, and nowadays, it's pretty hard to go out to lunch for less than $15, even if it's not dinner, and I'm very conscious that that $15 is a hunk of my food budget.
I'm thinking I may change this, that I think I'm going to let myself do a couple of things like that more than I used to, even if it means not doing a couple of other things I like.
I think I'm shifting some of my sense of what's important.
