Participant 30:
Yeah. I think that's...
If he continues to because in his case the antiques, it doesn't seem like they could have sentiment value if he's buying them, and if they're in every room, it's not like he has a collection of antiques that are displayed and that...
It doesn't sound like he could enjoy them.
I think if it's in the way of being able to get into rooms, I think that's a problem.
Also if he goes out every week antique shopping or you can go out antique shopping every week, but if you buy something every time you go out, I think that's, there's an issue.
Sort of like a compulsive shopping kind of issue.
Interviewer:
Do you think he would require treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 30:
I guess part of it is like if it doesn't bother him, and it doesn't effect anybody else, probably not, but if it's effecting his ability... I can't remember if you said that if he's one where he can't find anything, and...
Interviewer:
Yeah.
He spends 30 minutes to an hour looking for things until he finds them or forgets what he's looking for.
Participant 30:
Yeah.
It depends like if it doesn't bother him and it doesn't interfere with his relationships with other people, and it doesn't keep him from meeting commitments that he has, I'd say he probably doesn't really need professional help.
Or it depends, like does he think it's a problem?
So if he doesn't think it's a problem, and it's not effecting anyone else, and it's not a fire hazard, I don't think he needs professional help.
That's kind of borderline.
Interviewer:
Right, right.
Do you think his behavior is similar to your own or mostly different?
Participant 30:
It's different.
Because I don't... I don't go out and buy things all the time.
Although, you would think he doesn't have an emotional attachment to things, but it could be that it's something really speaks to him, when he's out at antique stores, and maybe he does have an emotional attachment.
Maybe he buys things, INAUDIBLE buying things because he thinks this might valuable, and if I just keep it for a while, I can sell it, and make a little money or does he buy things because it really speaks to him, and he has no intention of selling that or giving it away or getting rid of it?
I think that's a little more problematic.
Interviewer:
For this next section of the interview, we're going to talk a little bit about COVID, in particular, and how it's impacted you.
Have you noticed any sorts of behaviors changing because of COVID?
