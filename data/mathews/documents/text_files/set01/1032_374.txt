Participant 32:
But maybe...
It could've started sooner than that when I bought my first house and had some space to fill up with clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you think it's that availability of space that kind of triggered your problems with clutter a little bit since you had more space, you were able to collect more things?
Participant 32:
Since I had more space and commitment let's say, to being in the space since I purchased the house instead of renting.
And before I purchased, I would move pretty often and when I knew I was going to be moving every few months or every year or so, I didn't accumulate as much stuff.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, it was that sense of permanence that kind of allowed you?
Participant 32:
Yeah, that's the way to put it.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Interviewer:
Okay, and how severe would you say that this behavior is now compared to let's say back in 2001 or in the past?
Do you think it's gotten worse or better?
Participant 32:
I think it's gotten better because it's driven me so crazy that I've been really trying to work on it.
So yeah, I think I'm doing better a little bit.
Interviewer:
Okay, and would you say that it's gotten better just in general because like you've said your mind is just so fed up with it?
Or has that been a result of the coronavirus?
Participant 32:
No, it's just because I'm fed up with it.
But I don't think the coronavirus has had anything to do with it because that didn't change my lifestyle really because...
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, gotcha.
And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Participant 32:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Participant 32:
Yes, oh yes.
I think in classes...
Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't interject.
Interviewer:
No, go ahead.
No, you can go ahead.
Participant 32:
Yeah, I've taken decluttering classes.
I've bought several books on how to organize and declutter and of course I haven't read them but I have them.
I've read the first chapter or two and that's as far as I seem to get.
The intention is there, the intention to declutter and to not hoard is there but the follow-through to doing it is what I'm still having to work hard on.
Interviewer:
Why do you think the follow-through is so difficult for you?
Participant 32:
Oh, boy.
I think for me because making decisions is difficult.
I think it's more difficult than for maybe most people or the average person.
And I think that is... I guess I want to blame it in part on some brain damage that happened when I was 17 in a really bad car crash and I didn't find out about this brain damage until 10 or 15 years later.
But anyway, my frontal lobe was damaged and that's the area that organizes things and makes decisions.
