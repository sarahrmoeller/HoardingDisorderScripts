Participant 039:
Well, this room where I write my book is... Well, I was going to say it's going to get to the point where I won't be able to use the room for all the clutter, but that's not true because my computer is here and I have to use my computer. I have so far kept open a space from the door directly to my keyboard table and a table, kind of a desk, it's actually a table that I use as a desktop. I've left enough space to get to it, but all around me are bookcases full of books. There's a hutch that has space for books and it's full of books. 
The drawers I recently cleaned out the drawers so I could put things in the drawers, however, I ended up piling bins and books and all kinds of stuff in front of the drawers of this hutch so I can't use the drawers even though some of them are empty.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. It sounds like you do have a pretty considerable amount of clutter, huh?
Participant 039:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Are there any spaces that are open? Are you able to use your kitchen for its purpose, your bed for its purpose or are you kind of-
Participant 039:
The kitchen and the bathroom are pretty void of clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 039:
The living room is pretty good, simply because my partner says, "You just can't clutter up this living room because we do have guests from time to time, so you've got to keep it clear." I'm pretty good about keeping it clear. We don't have that many guests so sometimes I do start piling up stuff and realize that I am making piles so then I take them away. I don't like to sort through them and take, throw some things away and file other things, I'll just pick up the whole pile and move it to here into the study or into my bedroom.
My bedroom is pretty cluttered. I have three bookcases in it. I have a piano keyboard. I have a couple of jelly cupboards that I use as a dresser or to store my clothes, but usually I can't get at that those jelly cupboards. Then they end up, anything that I wear if it's not in the closet which I can access, they're thrown on a bin that's in one corner and a basket in another corner.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. Seems like you still have functional use, you're not completely unable to use things for their intended purpose but it's a struggle to get around things. You can't reach every area in your home.
Participant 039:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay. Gotcha. Let's see. Tell me about-
Participant 039:
The thing is, when we bought this, my partner bought this house, it was a small house and it was okay for us.
Interviewer:
Yeah, so that's what I was going to ask, two bedroom or?
