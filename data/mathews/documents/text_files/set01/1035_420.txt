Interviewer:
Why would you say it's a problem right now?
What makes it a problem?
Interviewee:
Since the COVID thing, I've been isolating in the house, and it has grown out into the den.
My kitchen's never, the counters are very ... I think I've got about three feet of visible counter space right now.
I just have stuff and odds and ends piled up all over the place.
I didn't do that before.
I don't know why.
Now, I'm going, God, if I can just keep the living room, the front of the house decent, and it's even kind of messy.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like it's gotten worse since you've been home?
Interviewee:
Yeah, it's gotten worse since I've just been home, and not able to move about, because of the restrictions and everything.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Have you been more isolated since COVID?
Do you feel like you've had problems just socializing at all?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I've been more isolated, because the usual thing that I would do, going to the gym, I make jewelry.
Oh boy, we don't even want to talk about that.
The amount of money I have tied up in beads and components.
I would meet with those friends at the shop on a weekly basis, and that went away.
Some of the structure in my life went away.
That was an issue.
Then, the granddaughter's spring break, I'm basically the ya-ya Uber service for getting her to her activities and everything.
Of course, all that stopped.
Basically, lost a lot of structure to the day.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Interviewee:
And the senior citizen center closed.
Interviewer:
Wow.
That is a lot of changes.
It sounds like you have definitely had your life totally disrupted by all this.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like it's-
Interviewee:
That's my excuse, anyway.
Interviewer:
It sounds like it's been really difficult.
It sounds like, like you said, a lot of the things that you used to structure your day have been taken away from you.
It also sounds like you must be seeing people a whole lot less than you were.
Interviewee:
Absolutely.
Texting or Zoom sessions or FaceTime, it's just not the same.
Interviewer:
No, it is not.
That is true.
Do you feel like it's impacted your purchasing or your shopping or buying at all?
Interviewee:
Oh yeah.
Me and Amazon, we're tight.
Interviewer:
You and me both.
Interviewee:
Way too much spending.
I realized too late to stock up on hand sanitizer and this, that.
In the early stages, when you couldn't get paper, disposable masks and before the cottage mask making industry really took off, man, I've got aloe and alcohol and bottles to make hand sanitizer.
Paper towels to make disposable masks ...
Shop towels.
Long story, but anyway, I ordered supplies right and left, and did a lot of impulse purchasing.
Again, bought clothes that I didn't need.
