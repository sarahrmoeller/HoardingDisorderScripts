Interviewee:
Both. Yes. It gets in the way of my daily life.
Interviewer:
Can you describe a time where you believe your clutter got in the way of something you really wanted?
Interviewee:
There have been times I've wanted to have people over and felt like I couldn't because there's too much furniture in my dining room, for instance, or papers in my office. I can't think of anything ... If by the question, you mean is there something I wanted to buy but couldn't because of my clutter?
Interviewer:
Or just something [CROSSTALK].
Interviewee:
Something I wanted [CROSSTALK]?
Interviewer:
Yeah. It could be that or anything that got in the way of your life and something you really wanted to do or anything?
Interviewee:
Yeah. You know, it feels like a domino effect a lot, that I may want to ... For instance, I want to paint the exterior of the house but before I do that I have to get rid of some of the things that are on the back patio or whatever it is but then to have that, I need to have a place for that to go or I need to have a weekend to be able to do it and so it never gets done and I don't get my house painted.
Interviewer:
Yes. Has your clutter ever impacted your relationships? I know you've probably mentioned this before, either romantic, family, or your work relationships?
Interviewee:
I don't think it's affected any relationships at work or romantic relationships but, currently, just with my daughter kind of recognizing it. I think sometimes I see her developing some of those habits but, hopefully, she's learning firsthand how to avoid it. I don't recall any impact it's had on our relationship.
Interviewer:
Yes. Would you be upset if, say, you had to get rid of some of your items? Like ones that hold value to you?
Interviewee:
No. If I had someone that would help me do that and help me see how ... I think I can let go. It's just when I'm having that conversation with myself, I tend not to let go.
Interviewer:
Yeah. That makes sense. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder itself?
Interviewee:
Can you read that question again?
Interviewer:
Yes. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder itself?
Interviewee:
I'm not sure. I think one of the things might be acquiring things that are completely unnecessary without knowing where you'll use it or how you will use it, where you will put it. That's kind of the acquisition of stuff but you were talking about saving things?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm . Yeah. Is there [CROSSTALK] ... Keep going. Sorry about that.
