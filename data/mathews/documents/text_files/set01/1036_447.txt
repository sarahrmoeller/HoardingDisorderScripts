Participant 036:
No, several years ago I stopped watching television. Because I didn't like what I was seeing. I still try to keep up with the news to a degree. In terms of reading otherwise, newspapers and that's what I'm constantly doing [inaudible 00:44:21] I live in a society that seems like it's going more and more insane I don't quite understand what's happening.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Do you feel like it's been easier to stay at home with your daughter and son in law in that house? Or do you fel like the have been going to work and it's normal with them, the people that you live with?
Participant 036:
Well my daughter is pretty much working, she's an engineer. She has to go to Houston to look over some of her bridges. Those are the new bridges she's designed and in the project daily report. Late before I knew doing bridges, like all the freeway inter changes, all the passes stuff like that. So she's been working from home[crosstalk 00:45:07].
Interviewer:
Have you had any conflict with her? Or the people that you have been home with? I know sometimes when people are all couped up together it gets difficult to stay in the same space.
Participant 036:
Oh, there's lot of space. My son in law, he's a developer, he goes out and looks at properties and he does work at home. If he has left for his office with a computer, my daughter has an upstairs office with a computer. We have really good internet access. We have a full gigabyte connection with AT&T. We have a strong internet, my grandsons they have video rooms with own bedrooms so there's plenty of stuff to do and stay out of each others' ear. We haven't had a problem, not that I'm aware of. 
Interviewer:
That's great.
Participant 036:
We have fortunate circumstances. Could be quite a bit different if it weren't that way. My daughter often has stuff delivered and stuff she need to go shopping brought to the car. Services like that have been available.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). That's wonderful.
Participant 036:
My son in law he likes to bu stuff on Amazon anyway[inaudible 00:46:15]. The only problem is my daughter has inherited my fat genes and she's ballooned up enough now, I don't know she'll ever go back to work. She's gotten abusive now but I can't really [inaudible 00:46:32] be taParticipant 036 seriously. That's going to be a problem for her professionally. That's going to be more of her problem [inaudible 00:46:39]. It bothers me because , I got some responsibility for that [account 00:46:43].
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I understand it's very difficult during all this to stay healthy and active.
Participant 036:
