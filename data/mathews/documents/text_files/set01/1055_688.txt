Interviewer : Alright, and it's never impeded your ability to do work?
Participant:
No, no.
Interviewer : Gotcha. Okay, so, just a couple more questions here, and then we're going to get to like more of a like demographics type question, and then we'll be done. So, just to wrap it up, um, in terms of your behavior, if you want to change it, why is, why would you want to change it? What's your main motivation for changing your behavior?
Participant:
For being able to use rooms, for safety. There’s something that needs to be done.
Interviewer : Right. So, when you say for safety, what do you mean by that?
Participant:
You cannot walk into a room. When you’re not able to use a room. But, then you’;’ end up trying to get into a room not knowing what you’re stepping on, and you can easily fall.
Interviewer : So, has that every happened? Has anyone ever like stepped on something or had like a fall due to the clutter?
Participant:
Well, I have.
Interviewer : Okay. Will you tell me about that?
Participant:
Well, there’s so much stuff in the room, and you don’t know what you’re stepping on. And, I don’t fall on the floor. I wasn’t seriously hurt or anything like that. Trying to, you know, see what was in a room/
Interviewer : Right. Okay, so you've definitely, you know, experienced some harm as a result of the clutter. Anybody else in your household?
Participant:
Not that I can think of.
Interviewer : Okay. Alright. And, so then, just one last question before we get into the demographics. You know, in, in the scenario in which, you know, you were to wake up one day and all of the possessions you'd been hoarding were suddenly gone, would you be upset?
Participant:
Yeah, because I wouldn’t get to go through it. Something could have been thrown away, something important that I would need.
Interviewer : Right. So, would there be any sort of relief that you would feel?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer : No relief at all, only upset?
Participant:
Yes, because I feel like I need to do this myself. It’s something I have to do.
Interviewer : Gotcha. So, it sounds to me then like, you don't really let anybody help you when you're, you know, looking through stuff trying to figure out what to get rid of?
Participant:
No, because nobody else is going to know my story of things. Because it’s not gonna be their memories.
Interviewer : Right. So, oftentimes do you go with your gut when it comes to determining what to keep?
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer : Gotcha. Alright, so, in that case, I'm going to move on to just some simple demographic questions and then we will wrap it up. Does that sound good?
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer : Okay, so, the first question is what was your sex assigned at birth?
Participant:
