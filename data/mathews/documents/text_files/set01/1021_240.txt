When I was younger, I was a lot more active and handy around the house.
I would fix things, so my tools were important for me to keep, because even if it's not something I use often, I knew that I might need that tool someday to fix something, so I wouldn't want to get rid of it because I might need it.
As I get older, I know that I'm doing less and less.
It's a little more difficult to go up on the roof now, so a lot of the tools I'm taking a second look at.
Another thing, I bought a motorcycle and I haven't rode it for four, maybe five years now.
It's like, okay, I go out in the garage, I start it up once in a while but I'm not riding it.
I'm thinking, well, I really need to get rid of it because it's losing any value it has as it gets older, and it's just sitting there.
So I've got to clear out...
The problem is the garage has got a lot of stuff in it, so it's not like I can just move the bike out real easily to put it up for sale.
There's some bigger equipment in there that I really have to move to get the bike out.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you basically chose your items based on usage and how often you use them and how important they are to be used, so your tools you use quite a bit and your computers that you use every day.
Is that how you chose those items?
Participant 021:
Right.
Right.
Interviewer:
So-
Participant 021:
Okay, go ahead.
Interviewer:
No. What were you going to say?
Participant 021:
I was going to say, I had some valuable dining room equipment, a dining room table and chairs that was pretty old, and I knew it was valuable just from people seeing it and asking me about it, but to me it didn't have a lot of value because it was a big round dining room table.
I live by myself.
It's not like I'm having dinner parties with five, six, seven people sitting around a table eating.
It's like I really didn't care what it went for because it was not useful for me.
