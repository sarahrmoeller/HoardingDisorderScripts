Interviewee45:
Because this house was completely filled, every crook and cranny, and then I moved 1500 square feet of my jammed in crammed possessions into this house on top of that.
There wasn't one empty cupboard.
There wasn't one empty closet.
There wasn't one empty anything.
So it was just came in box after box and then furniture and all these sofas and all these chairs.
I mean, I've gotten rid of a little bit of stuff.
I've worked hard at it.
It's hard to get rid of stuff.
Nobody wants it.
I think I could get rid of this if I could find anybody that wanted stuff.
I'd be slow at it but I would do it.
But nobody, but nobody wants anything.
This is now not anything most people value.
Interviewer:
Okay, so would you say that there are parts of your house maybe like the kitchen or bathrooms that you aren't able to access and that just are storage areas right now?
Interviewee45:
They're like storage areas but I'm very skilled at accessing things in storage areas.
I keep little narrow pathways and I can tiptoe over things that other people would find absolutely impossible to get everyday items.
I know to make it work for me but I have to stay very flexible and fit and agile in order to do it.
Interviewer:
Okay, so would you say that maybe your floor is entirely covered with either stacks of boxes or papers or are there parts of the floor that are actually clear that you can see?
Interviewee45:
Well, I have my exercise space, which is clear.
And even the other parts, I would say each room has maybe 20%, 30% of floor space, not every room, it varies.
I would say the very least is 15, 20% and some are a little more.
But, no, it's like a storage locker in each room.
I'm sorry to say and sometimes, every once in a while someone will come and need to stay here and then I'll get one bedroom cleared out and one bathroom cleared out.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So what would you-
Interviewee45:
But then it regresses and then it reverts back, alarmingly quickly.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee45:
And then the worst indicator of my mental condition is how much stuff is in the bed I sleep in.
If I'm feeling really insecure there are tons of books and papers and things in the bed, all night long.
Interviewer:
And you live alone then?
Interviewee45:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So what would you like your home to look like then?
