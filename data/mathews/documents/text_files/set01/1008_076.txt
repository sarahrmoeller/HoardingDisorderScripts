Interviewee:
... Very well, like carrying books around on silk pillows, so to speak.
If you observe behaviors like that, maybe you could identify.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE]
Interviewer:
Can you think of some personality traits?
What are some personality traits, you think, that would maybe give you an idea of that?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Maybe if you have views that nothing should ever go to waste or trying to find utility in everything.
Interviewer:
Right.
Do you think that, on that idea of waste, see this in people that struggle with the same stuff, is that kind of Great Depression Baby Boomer mentality.
Right?
Cause you really to ...
After all that, it made sense to save all your items.
Right?
Cause that was a very scary time.
Do you think that will kind of decrease as the generations go on, and maybe decrease hoarding behaviors?
Do you think it really won't make a difference?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I don't know that depravation alone causes it.
So, I don't know that if it'll become less frequent or not.
It is less severe for me than it was for my dad, there's no question about that.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Interviewee:
But it's still there.
So, maybe there'll be fewer severe cases, but I think there'd still probably be a lot of people that hoard.
Interviewer:
Totally.
Interviewee:
And maybe ...
I'm not qualified.
Interviewer:
Of course.
Yeah.
Interviewee:
But if people are feeling more disconnected in the modern world, and there's more stress, or isolation maybe there's going to be more hoarding.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewee:
And certainly to even acquire stuff.
Interviewer:
Yeah, it's been interesting with COVID too, how that's changed, which I do have ... I will ask you those questions too.
Interviewee:
Oh okay.
Interviewer:
So, any other way, do you think, to tell that someone is hoarding without being in their home?
Interviewee:
I guess ... I listed personality traits.
I think for the cases of this study, I mean, I was identifying by a psychological screening test.
Right?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
Interviewee:
So, I think that would work, or certainly probably worked in my case.
As far ... I guess is the question directed more at clinically, or is it directed more at just casually ...
Interviewer:
I mean, just a question.
And if you can't think of anything else that's fine.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Yeah, just I wonder when folks interact, like, if you're interacting with someone if you'd maybe ...
You know, you kind of get a sense for people, or there's certain things that you could clue into that might lead to it.
But you said a lot of stuff: anxiety, maybe how people treat their items, personality traits.
So, that makes sense to me.
