Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
And I got rewarded.
Interviewer:
Okay, well that was a good example.
Have you ever sought to change your behavior or gone to a professional?
Participant 37:
I saw a psychologist for...but that was not about hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
So I don't think I ever considered, I never thought of the point that I had gotten to as a serious enough problem to see someone.
I have other problems to deal with.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
I think one reason that it didn't become a problem was because as I grew older I had more space and space can be a problem for someone but I never got to a point where I needed a storage locker like some people.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
So you never went specifically for hoarding it was for other things?
Participant 37:
Definitely not, no.
Interviewer:
Okay.
You mentioned that your mom and your brother have issues with hoarding as well but how do your other family members and friends feel about your behavior?
Participant 37:
I think they're amused by me because of the rabbits that I pull out of my 40 year old boxes.
The music collecting, people have known me for years and they know my interest in music.
I think I'm fairly open about what level I've been at and we've visited with friends over the last few days and we talked about the process that we've been going through of cleaning things out.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
So I don't have an issue with friends.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So now we're going to go into a section more about the space that you live in.
Do you live alone or is their someone that lives with you?
Participant 37:
I live with my spouse.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What is the space like?
I know you mentioned you've been decluttering your garage but could you describe-
Participant 37:
We have a single car garage with a lot of shelves and on those shelves...do you want me to describe my accumulations or just the physical layout?
Interviewer:
You can describe both, just how your house is with your stuff in it.
Participant 37:
Okay, so the garage has shelving, some of which came with the unit and I realized how large it was so I bought more shelves.
I had bins INAUDIBLE so I still have bins of things on the garage shelves, I have boxes in the crawl space in the garage.
Upstairs we have a large kitchen, a large dining room, a large living room.
Upstairs we have three bedrooms, one of which is my room of declutter where I'm trying to get rid of things and digitize music.
And then above that room there's another crawl space which also has more boxes of my stuff.
Does that give you enough?
