Sent in the mail.
Interviewer: Okay, perfect. So, then with that, um, I want to thank you so much for all your time and participating in the study.

So, I just want to say again, thank you so much for taking this time to help us out with this, and if you have any questions, I can of course give you the contact information for the main PI of the study. And you can also get in contact with the woman you were first in contact with about the study of course. But, do you have any questions for me?
