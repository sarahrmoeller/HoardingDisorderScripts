Interviewer:
Does your behavior upset you?
Interviewer:
And how was the group setting?
How did you find that?
Participant 16:
Probably, but I'm also an emotional eater, so I just go open the refrigerator or the pantry door and I eat that feeling and cover it up.
Interviewer:
Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant 16:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And could you describe a time when your problems with clutter got in the way of something you really wanted?
Participant 16:
Up until the pandemic, I would have loved for neighbors that I'm close to to be able to come over to my house, sit around and have tea, or just sit and visit and chat, and I'm too embarrassed to do that.
Of course with the pandemic, I can't, but...
Interviewer:
So that socialization is something that you would CROSSTALK
Participant 16:
Yes, yes.
And need, I mean every person needs social experiences.
Interviewer:
And has it ever impacted any of your romantic or familial relationships?
Participant 16:
No. Interviewer:
No?
Participant 16:
Because I haven't had a romantic relationship in some years.
I gave up on having relationships with men.
Did you say family?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 16:
And I only have a brother.
My family is initially from Alabama and all of my relatives who still live in Alabama or Georgia are racist and I choose not to be in touch with them.
Interviewer:
Good for you.
Participant 16:
So my brother is the only family member and he lives in Kentucky and I'm in the middle of Texas.
Interviewer:
What are the main reasons why you would like to change your behavior?
Participant 16:
I would be happier when I have a social life and can invite people into my home and enjoy people seeing what I have, not coming in and admiring it, but not worrying about someone coming into my home.
Interviewer:
Yeah, you just don't want that worry or anxiety or embarrassment anymore.
Participant 16:
No. My definition of who I am doesn't include how I've been living in recent years, so there's a disconnect between who I think I am and who I actually am.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you're experiencing some of that cognitive dissonance, where your expectations of your reality aren't matching up.
Participant 16:
Yes, right.

Okay.
