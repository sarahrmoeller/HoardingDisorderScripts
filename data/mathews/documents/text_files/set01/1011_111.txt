Participant 011:
And now I'm on the landline.
Let me switch telephones.
Let me try this.
Interviewer:
Yes, that's fine.
Participant 011:
Hello?
Interviewer:
Hello.
Hi. Participant 011:
Here, let me see here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Switching phones.
Can you hear me?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 011:
Actually this is a much better phone.
I was just charging it up.
I can actually hear you clear.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 011:
I have to let the dog go out.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 011:
Otherwise he may do something in the house that he's not meant to do.
Okay.
Go on here.
I'm sorry, I have a little interruption.
Interviewer:
No it's fine.
Participant 011:
But no, this house is not cluttered yet.
but knowing me, it's going to get cluttered.
Interviewer:
So when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?
Participant 011:
At this point in my life, the only valuable possessions I have are sentimental things like photo albums and movies and videos.
Those types of things that are really hard to get rid of because they're sentimental.
And other than that, the other types of things that I find, some paintings that I've bought over the period of time are hard to get rid of because I bought the paintings and they were good paintings and the value has gone way up.
And I like good art, all kinds of good art.
So those types of things are a little hard to get rid of.
I mean, I'd have to auction them off and have appraisals, which I'm doing by the way, at this point in my life, I'm putting things aside for some parts of my family and giving things like that.
But yeah, my art is very difficult for me to get rid of because I have, yeah.
So I would say my most difficult thing to get rid of is the art that I've accumulated.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So would you say that's the most precious item in your house?
Is your art?
Participant 011:
Yeah.
Obviously the art is the most.
And also creative things that I've either bought or people have given me, those kinds of things are really hard to get rid of, like I mentioned earlier.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 011:
Because not just sentimental reasons, but because I have attachments to them, unfortunately.
I'm attached to this and attached to that.
So maybe they had to tie me down, but I've always loved good art.
So yeah.
Getting rid of the good stuff will be the most difficult thing to get rid of.
