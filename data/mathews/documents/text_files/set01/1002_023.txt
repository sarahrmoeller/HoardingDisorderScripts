Interviewer:
Yeah, okay, so how have you been coping, would you say? Has there been specific techniques that you've found helpful?
Participant 2:
I haven't been using been too many good coping methods, I've used, what people would consider... What the right word is, inappropriate? Eating, binging on TV shows, things that aren't the most beneficial health wise, or mental health wise. I do read a lot, but I haven't been exercising or doing a whole lot of things that are good for my health or mental health.
Interviewer:
Yeah, where do you think you seek comfort from? Is it from others, your items, something else?
Participant 2:
I used to get together with friends once or twice a month, but I haven't been able to do that. Right now I have my dog that I get comfort from her, from reading, but I'm in a lot pain so I am... That's harder, and when I'm less active the pain's worse. When I'm focusing on other things, I don't have as much time to think about the pain that I'm in. I find that when I'm working and engaged in stuff, my pain is... I have bulging discs and fibromyalgia so that pain is definitely real, it's not all in my head. But I can distract myself from my pain by doing things and stuff, but when I'm not doing things, I can't distract myself from it.
Interviewer:
Yeah, it's definitely tough to do.
Participant 2:
I'm sorry, I got distracted, [crosstalk 00:40:06].
Interviewer:
No, don't worry about it. Okay, I can just go back to the questions. Were you involved in treatment for your clutter problems prior to COVID-19?
Participant 2:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay, have the people living with you changed during COVID-19 at all?
Participant 2:
I mean, so I have siblings that are a whole generation younger, because we adopted them and they're home from school. Now they're doing school from home, and they're social life is different because they don't get to do stuff with friends as much. A lot of us are driving each other crazy, and arguments more. I've been keeping to myself in my room. It isn't a whole lot different, when I lived by myself, that's what I did. Just being around the family, when we're stuck together for months at a time, we drive each other nuts. I try to just keep my distance right now.
Interviewer:
Definitely, for sure. How has COVID-19 affected your sense of isolation? Has it made you more lonely or no?
Participant 2:
Yeah, I mean, I don't have much of a social life even before that. It's not a whole lot different, but I used to at least get together with friends once a month. I've just sat more.
