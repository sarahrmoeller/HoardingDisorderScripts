Interviewee:
Really not easy for me to talk about it.
So, I appreciate having the opportunity.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Okay, I just have to ask you some demographic questions, and then we'll be good to go.
So, what ...
This is, I guess, a two part question.
What is the sex you were assigned at birth, and what is your gender identity?
Interviewee:
Male.
Interviewer:
For both?
Interviewee:
I guess so.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Race?
Interviewee:
Caucasian.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Hispanic, yes or no?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Sorry that I'm typing in your ear.
Household income?
You can just give me an estimate, a range, if you don't know exactly.
Interviewee:
Yeah, so 125,000.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And what is your geographic region?
Like northeast?
South?
West?
Not in the U.S., which I don't think is true.
Interviewee:
Southwest.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Highest level of education?
I know you said college undergrad.
Any further?
Interviewee:
I have a master's.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What is your master's in, if you don't mind me asking?
Interviewee:
Geophysics.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Interesting.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Not something you hear very often.
Interviewee:
A little joke.
What does a geophysicist do?
Well, they kill the conversation at a cocktail party whenever they're asked what they do.
Interviewer:
Totally.
People are like, "Oh, I don't know how to follow up with that."
Interviewee:
I have nothing else to say in response to that.
