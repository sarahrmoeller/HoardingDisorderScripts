Participant 008:
Really not easy for me to talk about it. So, I appreciate having the opportunity.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay, I just have to ask you some demographic questions, and then we'll be good to go. So, what ... This is, I guess, a two part question. What is the sex you were assigned at birth, and what is your gender identity?
Participant 008:
Male.
Interviewer:
For both?
Participant 008:
I guess so. Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. Race?
Participant 008:
Caucasian.
Interviewer:
Okay. Hispanic, yes or no?
Participant 008:
No.
Interviewer:
Sorry that I'm typing in your ear. Household income? You can just give me an estimate, a range, if you don't know exactly.
Participant 008:
Yeah, so 125,000.
Interviewer:
Okay. And what is your geographic region? Like northeast? South? West? Not in the U.S., which I don't think is true.
Participant 008:
Southwest.
Interviewer:
Okay. Highest level of education? I know you said college undergrad. Any further?
Participant 008:
I have a master's. 
Interviewer:
Okay. What is your master's in, if you don't mind me asking?
Participant 008:
Geophysics.
Interviewer:
Wow. Interesting. 
Participant 008:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Not something you hear very often.
Participant 008:
A little joke. What does a geophysicist do? Well, they kill the conversation at a cocktail party whenever they're asked what they do.
Interviewer:
Totally. People are like, "Oh, I don't know how to follow up with that."
Participant 008:
I have nothing else to say in response to that.
