Participant 011:
Now that's a problem too, but I'm not a real box keeper anymore. When I was younger, I was probably like that guy. But I only keep a few boxes for necessity nowadays. But yeah, no, the way you're saying that, that he has to move boxes to go every room, that's a big problem. That's a clutter problem, but if he can't find his keys in 30 minutes, he's going to have to need some help here.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah, and so I will-
Participant 011:
So, that's.
Interviewer:
... read the next one, if that's okay too?
Participant 011:
Yeah, go to the next one.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, John Doe has papers that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. These papers occupy most of his rooms, except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be. So, same question. Do you think John Doe has more of a clutter problem or do you think it's more serious-
Participant 011:
No, he's got a clutter problem. This guy has definitely got... I mean, if you got to move boxes out of your bathtub to take a bath, that's the big clutter problem. I have never put anything in my bathroom, but that's not why I do it. Other than medicines and pills and things you need in the bathroom, towels and soap. But I'm not wanting to bring newspapers into the bathroom and pile them on-
Interviewer:
Yeah, so in this scenario-
Participant 011:
But I've been to places where people do that. I've seen it happen in my lifetime. I've seen piles of newspapers in the bathroom.
Interviewer:
Yeah. So in this scenario, would you say that his behavior is similar or different to your own?
Participant 011:
Not similar to my own. I don't have that problem.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay.
Participant 011:
Like I just told you I keep my bathrooms clean. They're sort of like a chapel. I don't put anything in there other than what's meant to be in there. And I don't bring books into the bathroom and leave them there, so no, I don't have that problem. But the other guy that you just read, he has that problem. And that's clutter.
