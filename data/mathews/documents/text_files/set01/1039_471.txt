Interviewer:
Do you think that that maybe inhibits your desire to discard because it seems like your friends don't care as much about it as maybe others would?
Participant 039:
Well, the funny thing, I care about more about what our friends think than Ann does. It used to be, she is a much more social person than I am. I'm really not social at all. The friends that we have are her friends.
Interviewer:
Got it.
Participant 039:
I'm just there. We have a friend over right now and I think this friend would like me to be out there visiting with them and I said, "No, I have an interview." Anyway, but I used to, and she would give parties all the, not all the time, but she would give Christmas parties and various kinds of parties and in the summer have people over for barbecue's and stuff, if I would allow it, but I am enough antisocial that I just put my foot down and say, "Nope." This is, again, something that I inherited from living with a very large family on a ranch and my father didn't want people around because people snope and people steal and people are judgemental and I grew up that way and that's the way I feel. I don't want anybody on my property. 
We used to have people, guys that would come to mow the lawn, and I tell you I would go get into a real fit. I would be as nervous and irritable as can be the day that these guys would show up to mow the lawn. I just couldn't stand it. 
Interviewer:
So, it sounds like a little bit of fear of people being in your space and that kind of contributed to maybe you being less social. That makes sense. I actually have some more questions, more like generally about your hoarding, so how long has this been going on for you?
Participant 039:
Oh, I can it back to about the year, nine years old or eight years old. At that time, since my mother was always, for some reason could never find a needle whenever she needed to mend something or to sew up something. She tried to put the needle in the curtains, just stick it in a couple of times, but sometimes I guess she would forget and when she couldn't find her needle, she didn't get nasty or mean because that wasn't the way my mother was, but she would go nuts and I couldn't stand it.
Interviewer:
So, nine years old, you think of, that's pretty early to remember that.
