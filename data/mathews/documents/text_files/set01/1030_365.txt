Interviewer:
Right.
And in the media, I know that there's that one show, on like TLC or something, like Hoarders.
How do you feel about the people that are displayed in that show, if you've ever had any exposure to it?
How do you think that they kind of different from your perspective of your clutter problems?
Participant 30:
When those shows first came out, what was that?
About 10 or 15 years ago, I used to watch them a lot, and then I kind of felt like I was really, that I could easily become that, and I felt like it sort of helped me, that watching those shows kind of helped me realize that even though I wasn't that extreme that it's something that I need to be aware of and watch out for.
Interviewer:
Okay, so seeing kind of the extreme representations of them has kind of helped you a little bit with like the self-identification, it sounds like?
Participant 30:
Yeah, I think so.
Interviewer:
Okay.
It also sounds like it's kind of motivated you to try and improve your problem a little bit too, as well.
Is that accurate?
Participant 30:
Yeah.
Yeah, that's true.
Interviewer:
Okay.
This next part of the interview, I'm going to read you a couple of vignettes, and they're basically just situations of certain people.
After I do these circumstances, I'm going to ask you a couple questions.
It's going to get a little bit tedious, because they're the same questions for each scenario, but it should be very easy.
I'm going to start with this first scenario, and then I'm going to ask you a couple questions about it.
John Doe has several boxes he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.
He's worried he might get rid of a box that he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in any other rooms.
His house is not always organized, but is usually not cluttered.
Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.
The first question is should this person try and change their behavior?
Participant 30:
No, I don't think so.
Interviewer:
Would you classify this more as like clutter problems or is this a full blown hoarding disorder?
Participant 30:
Oh, it's definitely not a full blown hoarding disorder.
Just more clutter.
Interviewer:
Would you say that this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 30:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think this behavior is similar or different to your own?
Participant 30:
Similar.
INAUDIBLE
Interviewer:
But it's not something that's overwhelming?
