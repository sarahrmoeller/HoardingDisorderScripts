Interviewer:
Right, yeah.
Participant 37:
We don't go often and we're pretty careful, we're always masking.
Interviewer:
That's good. How has or has covid affected your family financially?
Participant 37:
So far, no.
Interviewer:
Okay. So now our last section is still about covid. How have you been coping since COVID-19? 
Participant 37:
I worry about everybody. I've had friends who were affected and so it's pretty much... we can't do things. We were supposed to go to Canada for a month and well, we couldn't, so that was very disappointing. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. Where do you seek comfort? Do you seek comfort from your items or from others?
Participant 37:
[inaudible 00:45:14] Not from my items, no. I guess my interactions with humans other than on the phone or neighbors that we might see in the parking lot. What was I going to say... 
Interviewer:
You were talking about interactions with people.
Participant 37:
Yeah. I miss having the freedom to do whatever I want. 
Interviewer:
Right. Have you sought treatment resources or some other kind of professional support during covid?
Participant 37:
No. I haven't felt the need to do that from covid, no. I think there was one point where my wife was getting a little stir-crazy, I don't know if it was the weather was keeping us in more than usual or just missing human contact. I think we've reached a point where we have sort of a mix of making contact, distanced contact, with a few close friends and my son, our daughter came to visit for a few days. We're [inaudible 00:46:42] a vacation for two weeks this weekend.
Interviewer:
Oh, how nice.
Participant 37:
So we're trying to get something to keep us out of [inaudible 00:47:02] horrible, horrible place.
Interviewer:
Right. Did you feel socially isolated or lonely before COVID-19?
Participant 37:
No. 
Interviewer:
Has covid affected any sense of isolation or loneliness?
Participant 37:
Yeah, I miss being able to casually see somebody. I was involved in my local YMCA [inaudible 00:47:32] couple of activities and I miss... One of them had more of a comradery than the other, it was a one-on-one type of situation, the other one was a class situation, but, you know everybody's... Some of the same people that was nice.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 37:
But I've kind of learned to do that one exercise, the class one, on my own at home. I give myself a harder workout so I've adjusted to that. The other activity I miss very much and I dream about it on a semi-regular basis.
Interviewer:
Right. So some things you've learned to adapt to and other things you still miss.
Participant 37:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And my last question is have you experienced any conflict during the COVID-19 measures?
