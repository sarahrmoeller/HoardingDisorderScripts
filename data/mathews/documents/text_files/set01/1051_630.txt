Interviewer : And did you do so?
Participant:
Uh, in that case with the cookie cutters, I don't believe I did.
I just did without them.
I just did without them, and I didn't make, you know, little stars, or Christmas trees, or whatever it was that I was trying to do.
It's been so many years, I don't remember exactly what it was.
But it happens a lot of the times, like certain kitchen utensils.
Or he'll say, “Hey, you have all this all these canning supplies.
You haven’t canned in 10 years.
Let's get rid of it.”
And my first thought is no, because what if I want to do it again?
Interviewer : Right.
Okay so, do you have any sort of conflicts with your friends, or maybe like some landlords or any people that you have different relationships with?
Participant:
No, because my friends generally are not judgmental.
Interviewer : Okay.
Participant:
And, when I do have people come to the house, the center of the house—you know, the living room, kitchen, guest bath— those are all presentable.
And every other room can have a door.
Interviewer : Right.
Participant:
And that was kind of my mother's attitude when we were kids.
She said, “You don't want to clean up your room?
That's fine.
I’ll just close the door.”
Interviewer : Okay, so it sounds like there's certain areas of your house that aren't cluttered, and are presentable to, you know, a guest if they were to come over.
Participant:
It will work.
Interviewer : Right, okay.
Participant:
You know what I mean?
If you were to come to my house right now, you would see, you know, probably a box, or a backpack, or something sitting in the front hallway.
I mean I have to pick up things that I wouldn't have to.
I mean, I wouldn’t have to completely— my house, it's not like Collier’s mansion.
Interviewer : Right.
Participant:
I mean, honestly, even the worst parts of my house does not look like an episode of Hoarders.
