Interviewer:
Right, so you don't feel like you would benefit from somebody helping you to do it because it's not a hard task, you just haven't been ready to do it yet?
Interviewee6:
Right.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee6:
Right, I've got that emotional attachment and nobody's going to help me with that.
Interviewer:
How about your family and friends, what's the reaction to this from your daughters, from your husband, from other people?
Interviewee6:
My kids don't even notice.
My friends say my house is very neat, my extended family will say, "When are you going to get rid of those toys on those shelves?" Or, "When are you going to get rid of that pile of newspapers?"
Interviewer:
So they make comments, teasing.
Interviewee6:
Pardon?
Interviewer:
They'll make comments, just kind of teasing?
Interviewee6:
Oh yeah, we have that kind of relationship.
And it's not in every room in the house, but I think my husband, he's the main-
Interviewer:
He's mostly bothered by it out of all of the people in your life?
Interviewee6:
He's very bothered by it, yeah.
Very bothered by it.
Interviewer:
So tell me about your home, where is the clutter mostly centered?
And you said it's very neat and organized so it's all put away in boxes and out of sight?
Interviewee6:
A lot yeah, in the basement there's a lot of stuff, there's some stuff in the attic.
I'm looking around my bedroom and it's a fairly large bedroom but the only clutter I see is a pile of newspapers and mail that frankly goes back years that's sitting in the corner on a table.
So that's the bedroom, the bathroom, the kitchen, nothing, no clutter.
The children's rooms they deal with, the dining room is completely clear and the living room is clear.
I would say probably, now that you ask probably just the family room.
Interviewer:
Yeah it sounds like you're doing a great job.
Yeah.
Interviewee6:
Well my desk is in the family room, so I've got a lot of papers on the desk and I brought in a folding table and put more papers on that folding table and then there was shelves there with toys and books that the kids no longer use.
Interviewer:
So what space in your home is the space that either you spend the most time in or that you like to spend time in the most?
Interviewee6:
Well the kitchen just because, well because.
But mostly it's the family room because it's a very big room and it has big windows and I get to see outside and it's pretty in all of the seasons.
But if that were free of clutter I would be so happy.
Interviewer:
What would you like that room to look like?
Interviewee6:
I would like it to only have the furniture that I need which I pretty much do, and no clutter.
