Interviewee:
That’s interesting. Yes. So I would say that they, oh wow I’m just think like could I just walk away from these things? No, I don’t think I could do that. But when I am, but I don't feel like when I come back from Being at someone else's house or being having gone on vacation. I don't feel like, oh, my thing. Oh, I'm finally home with this feels right. So, so that's interesting. I think that I… kind of important.
Interviewer:
Okay,
Interviewee:
Not as important.
Interviewer:
So they're not they're not like a necessity, like they don't. You don't need them all the time in order to feel comfortable.
Interviewee:
No, I definitely don't need all the time.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
But, I know what you mean but no I don’t.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, and which objects are most important to you and which ones do you spend a lot of time with?
Interviewee:
Um, I think maybe. I Like styling these books. I’ve got these books. I’ve got books on top of books, and books in front of books. Plus around the other books. And books over there. Maybe, maybe it's the books. Uh, yeah but I also have these baskets. And I’ve got baskets for the whole neighborhood, but nobody who's going to get any of them.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you would say that books and baskets are the items that are most important to you.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. And are there specific parts of your home that you would consider cluttered.
Interviewee:
I’d say that every part of my home has a corner that’s cluttered. So, there isn’t like this one room, or “I'll keep everything in that room so this room can be uncluttered.” So, like there’s pockets in every, every room.
Interviewer:
Okay. And you would say that they are cluttered, just because there's objects that shouldn't be there or that are like in little stockpiles?
Interviewee:
There are things, like things on the floor. That should be not on the floor.
Interviewer:
Okay. That should have their proper place and be put away.
Interviewee:
That should have a proper place. The proper place is not on the floor. But there isn’t a proper place. It’s not that I’m not tidy, it’s because there’s not a place.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, are there parts of your home that you don't use so like parts of your home that aren't being used in the way that they were intended to be used?
Interviewee:
I'm not sure what you mean by that. For example, we’ve got two bedrooms for my children who aren't here now. And I’ve resisted putting my things in there. But I could also imagine that I could take over this house because we’re an empty nest now. They're not being used for me but they’re being held for them.
