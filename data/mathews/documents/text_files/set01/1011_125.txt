Interviewer:
Yeah, we can send you-
Interviewee:
I'm hoping you can just add onto that one rather than give me another one.
Like I say, that's just making more clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
If you give me another card, then I may have to go through the whole rigamarole of doing the pins and all that stuff again, which I can't stand.
Yeah, if you could just use that Bank of America card I got from University of Florida, that would be really nice.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Let me see what I can do.
Interviewee:
Yeah, electronically.
All they have to do is just throwing a couple of bucks onto it there.
I still have a few dollars.
I think I used it once for something.
But yeah, that would be perfect for me.
Keep the clutter down.
If you give me a new card, then I got to go through that whole rigamarole.
I have a box of these darn gift cards, like I told you.
I don't know which has money on it or which doesn't.
That means I have to call these companies, do all this, and do all that.
I'm bogged down by it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Okay.
So once again, thank you for participating.
And we sincerely appreciate your help as we try to better understand CROSSTALK.
Interviewee:
Yeah, where are you calling from, Katia?
Interviewer:
I'm calling from California,
Interviewee:
But where?
Is it in the Bay Area or Southern California?
Interviewer:
Southern California.
Interviewee:
Oh my God.
Yeah, you got that nasty San Fernando Valley fire down there.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewee:
Awful.
And then that awful one down there in San Diego.
So you guys got a lot of smoke down there too, right?
Interviewer:
Yeah, we do.
Yeah.
Interviewee:
It's been hotter than hell.
121 in LA yesterday.
Holy cow.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Do you have any questions or concerns?
Interviewee:
No. No, I think we covered it.
Like I said, I'd just like to, sooner or later, find the outcome of the study.
See if there's anything that you can come about that can help us older people who are clutter bees like myself so we get some light at the end of the tunnel.
And the most important thing, is there a genetic connection?
That's the one I want to know.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Is there going to be a genetic heritage study of the clutter?
That's the other thing I would like to know about.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So I will make sure to let Interviewer know that you want that information.
She can send that to you.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
That's why I signed up for the saliva test, to begin with.
And hopefully, we can find out if it had something to do with the genetic makeup.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I understand.
