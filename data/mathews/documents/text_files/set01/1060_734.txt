Participant:
You know something? this is really weird like if you see them outside your house; like we’ll be driving around, we’ll be in a parking lot. I can tell who’s a hoarder by their car. Their dash is just like everything. They have tons of crap in their car and I’ve seen it with my whole family. My car gets like that. In my van, I have a box that shouldn’t be in there but it’s got books to read if I have to wait, it’s got a crossword puzzle. Something’s in there that shouldn’t be in there. But I want it there. You know? So, that’s one way. Another way too, I noticed how people dress. You’ll see some people with 10-12 necklaces on and bracelets because they can’t decide what they want to do. I notice is a lot, you know, with people and they’re all hoarders. Because I’ve met them and talked to them. And they’ll tell me “I didn’t know what to wear.” So, that’s the only thing I’ve got for you.
Interviewer:
Ok, so you can spot if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their homes based on how their car looks, like the interior of their car and how people dress because it conveys a sense of undecidedness.
Participant:
Yeah undecided that’s the word. Thank you.
Interviewer:
Mhm. Ok let’s see. Where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Participant:
Actually, I don’t because I never thought it was a problem of mine. I actually didn’t start to think about hoarding until my daughter was very, very depressed. Not now she isn’t, but she retired not this January but last January here at the library. You would have saw her house that’s what said, we’ll talk about her after this, UNCLEAR  wasn’t raised the way she was living. And she was UNCLEAR, her expression you know, then I’d try to read up on depression hoarding and stuff like that. That’s how I thought about me. So, I felt like I was a hoarder. I would have thought I was a saver. So, a saver is not a hoarder.
Interviewer:
True.
Participant:
You know? I save things but if you over-save things you cross the fence.
Interviewer:
So did you do most of your reading from internet sources or books?
Participant:
Internet. Talking to people. I’m a very talkative person. I’ll talk to people in line. Stuff like that. Yeah, I really researched. Oh my god I’m a big research person. I research everything. So, yeah. It’s something I like to do.
Interviewer:
So, you first heard of hoarding disorder from reading about it, you said?
