Ultimately, it's deciding how to get this over with, get on a different direction of... It's like, he's dead set now on living in the street, having nothing, starving to death, suicide, whatever. This kind of talk is-
Interviewer:
That's overwhelming to be around. 
Participant 34:
So very stressful to live with it. And I've just been searching for the resolution for, but our lease ends in October, so that gives me the opportunity to break off in my own direction. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. And it sounds like that'll be a welcome change for you. 
Participant 34:
Yes, indeed. And it's not my responsibility if he's not preparing himself. 
Interviewer:
No, not at all. It's nice to hear that you're aware that it's not your responsibility, and while you sympathize with him, you recognize that you must do what's good for you and not... Seems to be working towards moving out. And not only will it get you out of that situation, but it'll help with cutting down on items too.

Interviewer:
Yeah. It could be, you never know. 
Participant 34:

Interviewer:
So for the questions that I have related to the interview, that brings me to the end. Did you have anything else you wanted to discuss? 
Participant 34:
No, no. It was a very interesting chat and actually valuable for me in processing some thinking. So thank you very much. 
Interviewer:
Thank you. I loved talking to you and getting to hear about what you've worked on as well as what you value. 
Participant 34:
Well, I hope others in the study are similarly of interest.
