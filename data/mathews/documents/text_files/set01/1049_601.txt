Interviewer:
So, how did you decide when you had too much stuff? How did you know?
Participant 49:
When you can't get into your house, it's pretty clear you have too much. And way before then, I realized I was getting too much. But I fell down the stairs in January, and I didn't have my phone with me. And I thought at first that I couldn't get up, but I could get up.
But if I hadn't been able to get up, I would have ... I thought, "Well, first of all, I don't have my phone, so I can't call for help. Second of all, even if they knock down the door, they can't even get in the house, really. They, whoever might come to help."
So then you realize, "This is a little excessive." It has become a safety issue. And I think it was a safety issue for a long time before I said, "Yes, it's a safety issue."
Interviewer:
Okay, that makes sense. Okay. So I think that covered all of the ideas of value and stuff, and how you value your items. The next section is discussing how you distinguish hoarding disorder. And so like, what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and what is hoarding?
Participant 49:
I guess hoarding is ... and my collecting comes under obsessive-compulsive. I mean, it's not just saving something. It's a lot. A lot. And the hoarding is ... Maybe it has to do with what I've been describing. There are so many different things that I collect.
If I only had books, and I didn't have all the other stuff, the house would maybe be all right. But I have books and needlework, and TV. So, hoarding is like ... It's just excessive. It's a matter of degree. It's not just a collection that you would put out for somebody to see. It's keeping it for me. You can't see it all. There's nowhere to see anything in this house.
Interviewer:
So you think maybe that saving behavior is different from hoarding in the sense that saving is kind of like, people collect things and then they can put it on display, but it's more like hoarding when no one's coming to see it all. It's just for your own personal satisfaction. Am I understanding that?
Participant 49:
Well, and the degree of how much of it there is. It's not a sensible amount of something like a little collection of teapots. I know somebody that has a collection of teapots. It's nothing like that. If I was a teapot collector, I'd have teapots from all over the world, and they'd still be in boxes and I'd have them stashed away somewhere, because there would be no place to put them. So it's a degree. It's a degree, there's so much more stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
