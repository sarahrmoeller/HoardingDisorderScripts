Participant 042:
I think I'm getting slightly better just from realization. You're going, okay, after I do this, then what? I'm beginning to see cause and effect and if I have someone to be accountable to, and I'm working on that, then I can say that person or people, "Well, I threw a bunch of stuff away and I got detached from this stuff and I put some stuff out of the way where I couldn't add to it." Then reward myself. I don't know. I think there's a pathway ahead to getting better and that's good.
Interviewer:
That is great. Has there ever been a time where it got in the way of something you really wanted though?
Participant 042:
Yeah, sure. Often.
Interviewer:
Did you... Go ahead.
Participant 042:
Go ahead. Well, if I find myself in the position of I can give away something. Example, I gave away a couple books before the COVID-19, there's a problem, somebody came to give me back the book, I thought, "Why are you giving it book? Keep the book." I thought, "Well, I can give away things, and have a good feeling about it." That person was in the nursing home, didn't have anything to read. Why should I hoard that book? You never know, maybe later I can find an online version if I want to reread it. One person, she's known me 33 years and lived in Michigan, I can call her and say, "Is it okay to give me away that book?" She'll say, "Yes. Good, you did it, it's okay." That is my goal to be better and be in the position I can give something away and it will be all right. You know what I'm saying?
Interviewer:
Okay, makes sense. It sounds like it has upset some of the people that are in your life, but that they're also helping you to get better and to change.
Participant 042:
Yes.
