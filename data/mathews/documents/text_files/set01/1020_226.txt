Interviewee:
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm a fairly... I don't know what... solitary person at the best of times.
I like being alone.
I think I've really been looking at this level of meaning, like what do these things mean to me?
Why do they feel [INAUDIBLE] Why do I like having a card of two little girls talking with each other that somebody gave me?
Why do I have that in front?
There's a whole pile.
Why am I looking at that?
Why did that seem important enough to put in front?
It may seem like a tremendous waste of time, but because I...
Interviewer:
You've really been-
Interviewee:
I don't know.
Interviewer:
... thinking a lot about what it is about certain items-
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
... that makes them appear to be so meaningful to you.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Absolutely.
Yes.
Interviewer:
When you think about your behavior or the behavior of your brother or people who have hoarding problems, how does that behavior differ, in your opinion, from people who save things for "normal" reasons, so like people who are collectors?
What's the difference?
Interviewee:
Well, it seems to me that people who are real, genuine collectors are often thinking about the financial value of things, but even when they're not... I guess I think that most people are able to better evaluate the space they have available versus the things... how full do they want that space to be, and if they don't mind having lots and lots of stuff together, crammed in one place, because they like everything, then that's one thing.
I think about my grandmother.
When she died, we found she'd collected... I don't know.
You're probably too young to remember this, but back in the '50s and before, you would go to a card store, and they wouldn't have all the cards on display.
They'd have great big books of sample cards that you could order and pick.
Then each season, they'd give away the old books of sample cards.
My grandmother would get them, because she was poor, and she would save some of the cards, and she would take some of them out, and she used them as photograph albums.
She moved well over 100 times in her life, so she had to deal with that problem a lot of how much can I take with me?
Interviewer:
And she saved them.
Interviewee:
She kept some things she probably didn't need, but it wasn't outrageous.
You know?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewee:
It didn't make everybody else have to live around her or something.
Interviewer:
When you think about the term hoarding disorder, do you identify with that term?
Do you feel like you have hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Not really.
