Interviewer:
When you think about the different things that you keep, what do you think makes them valuable?
Why is your stuff important to you?
Interviewee:
It's things that I have needed at one time, and so there is the idea that I might need it again, and then there's things that I think I could give to somebody.
Interviewer:
So, if your sister was there and was saying, "Why do you keep this?
Why do you have all of this?" you would say, "Well, this has been useful to me, and it might be-"
Interviewee:
Well, you would have to go through each item one at a time.
Interviewer:
So, you have a different reason for keeping each thing?
Interviewee:
Yes, but then when things are all piled in one container, all miscellaneous, if each item has a different reason for being there, but yet there's too much of it, then there's the impulse to avoid it...
Interviewer:
Because you'd have to think about-
Interviewee:
... just because of all the work involved.
Interviewer:
Right, because for each item you'd have to decide if you should keep it or not.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
When you're going through that process, if you were to pick a random item, and you were to go through that process with me of deciding whether or not for any given item you should keep it or you should not, what does that process look like for you?
What are the decisions that you make?
So, would it be something like, "Is this useful to me?
Is this valuable?"
Interviewee:
Is it useful to me, useful to someone else, or...
Interviewer:
Valuable in terms of money?
Interviewee:
There had been the idea of, well, it could be more valuable in the future than it is now, but I don't really see the physical items that way anymore so much.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you save a lot of old things.
Would you say that that's right?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
That you particularly like to save older things?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Why?
What is it about older things that you feel you should save?
Interviewee:
Well, I guess the scarcity.
Interviewer:
So, something that's older, you might not be able to get it anymore?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
What about, for instance, the letters that you're digitizing?
If you were to explain to somebody like your sister, who doesn't understand, what is their importance?
Why do those need to be saved?
Interviewee:
I guess she's not too bad about that, but then there was a lot of way too many physical photographs that my mom had kept in the '80s and '90s, so these more recent ones, those I would really rather digitize, so once I've done that, I'll get rid of them-
Interviewer:
So, those, because they're not as old-
Interviewee:
... and then I've been now in the process of figuring out what equipment to use and when I'm going to do it.
Interviewer:
So, you intend to maybe get-
Interviewee:
So, there's that.
