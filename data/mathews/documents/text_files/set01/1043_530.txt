Interviewee:
Can you repeat that one more time?
Interviewer:
Absolutely.
Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being inside their home?
Interviewee:
My friends know that I have ...
Not all of them necessarily know what my place looks like but if somebody needs something and we're out somewhere, most of my friends know that I'm the one to ask, whether it be a Band-Aid or ... I keep a lot of stuff in my purse.
Interviewer:
Okay.
You would say maybe one way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home is if they have a lot of things on them at all times, even in public?
Interviewee:
Actually, I just said that but I'm going to take that back because [CROSSTALK].
Interviewer:
That's perfectly okay.
Interviewee:
I don't have a suitcase for a purse.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
No. Actually, I don't think that without looking inside their home unless you talk about it.
People probably wouldn't know.
Interviewer:
Right.
You would say it would be easier to tell if somebody has hoarding disorder by going inside their home and there really isn't a way to tell unless you do see the physical parts of their home?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
You did mention that you've heard about hoarding disorder on the reality TV shows and such, are there any other places that you've gotten information about hoarding disorder?
What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
I mean, I've read literature on OCD so I know that it's part of OCD.
For the most part, I think about those shows.
I look at it and I think how can somebody live like that?
Interviewer:
Right.
Yeah.
Is the show what comes to mind when you hear the word hoarding disorder or what other things come to mind when you hear those words?
Interviewee:
I think the shows are what come to mind.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Do you think that your behavior with your difficulties with clutter do they upset you?
Interviewee:
Upset me?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Why?
Interviewee:
Because I'm embarrassed.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I know that you've mentioned prior that you would like people to come over but it's difficult because you have to move things out of the way.
Are there any other things in your daily life that you think your difficulties with clutter get in the way of?
Interviewee:
Finding things that I need because maybe someone was coming, like the one that was coming to help me clean, and so I'd shuffle all the papers and stuff I was going through into one pile and then I end up having to go through the pile again to find the bill I was going to pay or something.
