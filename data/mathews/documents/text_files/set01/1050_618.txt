Interviewee50:
If I feel like it doesn't fit my needs or future needs or it's broken.
That's one thing that the class taught me, or the group thing taught me.
Was sometimes I would hold on to things that we'll all get this fixed, or this is really valuable.
It just needs to be fixed.
I would see potential on things.
And so the group has helped me, if it's broken or I haven't fixed it in the last week or year that I'm still not going to fix it.
So I definitely would throw it away.
One thing I didn't have that some of in the discussion was once it's in the trash, I am not jumping in the dumpster, in the bag to go get it out because all of a sudden I changed my mind.
It's in the bag, it's gone.
Soit's hard.
It's not like useful.
If it is broken, it goes in the trash.
Interviewer:
So you don't have the problem of, once you decided that something is going to be discarded, yeah it's gone?
Interviewee50:
It's gone.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
And it sounds like if something's broken, you've kind of made peace with the fact that you're probably not going to fix it.
And so it's gone?
Interviewee50:
Yes.
That's one of the things I learned from the group that I was struggling with.
Interviewer:
And it sounds like the biggest thing that will stop you from discarding is this feeling that it's still valuable to you, that you could still use it in the future.
Is that right?
Interviewee50:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll buy things off these and like I found these great golden silver pen, and I had been looking for this Christmas to do the Christmas part, which once again I did not get sent out again.
But anyway, in hopes that I would get to it as well.
Interviewer:
So for instance acquire things because you want to be able to do Christmas cards.
So you'll hang onto something if you think that you're going to be able to do it in the future?
Interviewee50:
Yes.
And it's something that is reasonable.
You know what I mean?
If I found a space suit on sale, I wouldn't sit there and go, "Oh, okay, well, I'll get that and then maybe one day when they send people to Mars, I will have it."
It has to be something really reasonable or practical.
Interviewer:
So it's all stuff that is possible for you to use?
Interviewee50:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And even if you haven't used it, even if it's been sitting around since the day you bought it and it's still kind of right in front of you, as long as it's still possible for you to use it, you'll continue to hang onto it?
