Participant 035:
Right. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, that makes sense. How long in terms of time do you feel like it's been going on? When you think back over the past months and years, when do you think it first started to get to a point where it moved beyond just being present, to being a problem? You think it's been years, do you think it's been more recent than that?
Participant 035:
I think, oh, it's definitely been years. Definitely been years. Let's see. Probably back in the '80s, it started getting worse. 
Interviewer:
Were you always living in the same home that you have now?
Participant 035:
No. I was a single mom, raising a son. I, let's see, started out in a apartment. I had a home when I lived in Gainesville. Didn't do clutter then. Yeah, I lived in an apartment, and it started getting ... But it was a townhouse. I could confine the mess to the upstairs, and that was great, and keep the downstairs in good shape. I guess just as time went on, it just started getting worse and worse.
Interviewer:
Was it related to your children or your child leaving home?
Participant 035:
Yeah. There were difficulties with my son. Then, let's see, he was starting to get into trouble. Went to live with his father, and that was pretty stormy. 
Interviewer:
[crosstalk 00:18:04]
Participant 035:
For him. Working us both against each other, and that sort of thing. Just a really toxic situation all the way around. I know that made my depression and some anxiety, et cetera, et cetera. I think the clutter got worse then. Kind of feeling-
Interviewer:
It's gotten-
Participant 035:
... I failed at this, dadadadada. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. It's gotten worse when there've been more stressful or just more difficult periods in your life, it sounds like. 
Participant 035:
Right. 
Interviewer:
How it's been impacted by moving or changing homes?
Participant 035:
I purchased my house, gosh, the house I'm living in in '05. I still have a garage full of boxes that I haven't unpacked. Then, after my mother passed away, we had several stages of breaking down households, and I still have a few boxes of my parents' stuff that I need to deal with. It's just all added to it. Just, I feel more overwhelmed than ever. 
Interviewer:
That makes sense. It sounds like in addition to the stressful periods in your own life, every time you've had to deal with packing stuff up, or having stuff arrive, from inheriting it, it's just been added and you haven't been able to have the chance to go through it. 
Participant 035:
Right. I've got the chance. I'm totally retired. 
Interviewer:
It's maybe not a question of time.
Participant 035:
Yeah. It's the willingness to go through it and deal with it. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. I understand. Do you feel like your behavior is a problem for you right now? 
Participant 035:
Yes. It is.
