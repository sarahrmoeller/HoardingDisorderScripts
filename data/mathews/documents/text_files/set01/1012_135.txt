Interviewee:
Okay. Then my last question about this, was there ever a time maybe in college that you had a roommate that you guys ever got in disagreements about clutter or did you pretty much live at home and then lived with your husband?
Participant 012:
Well, actually, in high school I was in a boarding school.
By choice.
I had three different roommates.
We didn't really have any real issues back then that I can remember.
We weren't allowed to have much stuff.
We had constant inspections and stuff.
That kind of helped keep things in control.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Participant 012:
I just kept all that stuff at home.
When I'd go home, take it home.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Participant 012:
I didn't go away to college.
I was married by that point.
Interviewee:
Okay.
It seems like overall it didn't really impact any of your relationships, whether that was family, romantic, or work at all.
Participant 012:
Yeah.
No. Interviewee:
Okay.
Kind of my last question is would you like to change permanently or do you think this is always going to be a phase where you kind of get rid of stuff and then you might collect a little more and you have to go through periods of change?
Participant 012:
I'll always struggle with it.
I'll always want stuff and collect stuff.
I'm sure even now and going into my next phase of life because I enjoy stuff.
I enjoy having it around me.
I can't imagine not ever having stuff around me and collecting and stuff.
I think of my niece who has a completely bare house because she likes it that way.
Nothing.
No knick knacks.
Hardly any furniture.
Just completely bare house.
I'm the exact opposite but I like having ...
It makes me feel good.
I enjoy seeing it.
I can't imagine ever not being that way but it would be nice to be able to control it better so it's not so overwhelming.
I'd like to change that I'm not interested in so many different things.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Have you ever thought about seeking professional help with this?
Participant 012:
Not about this area.
Other areas, depression and stuff, yes, I have but those are sort of get those under control and then this would be under control is kind of my thinking.
Interviewee:
Okay.
That makes sense.
Okay.
That pretty much concludes ...
