Interviewer:
So the next question is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?
Participant 1:
No. I mean, maybe ... you know what upsets me is when I lose something. I cannot stand it when I lose something and even the most little thing. If I lose it, I freak out and I don't know what that's about either. It's like they're just a material thing. But it's almost like I feel like I'm losing my mind and it drives me nuts. It just drives me nuts. And it just gives me comfort to know it's there whether I use it or not. It's weird. it's just a weirdness that I have. That's part of my clutter problem.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Let me think here. What do you think the most important difference is between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?
Participant 1:
Well, hoarding disorder is when you let the papers pile up to the point where there's just stuff that you really just don't need. But you still want to go through it. It's like at some point it's collecting dust and it's just crazy. Like I'm looking in my room right now which is just nuts. And so I think when the piles start getting pretty high ... and this caused problems in one of my relationships. My old boyfriend who walked into the kitchen, I had piles up all over. he just took his arm and went boom. And just knocked them over.
Interviewer:
Oh, wow.
Participant 1:
I've had enough. I have had enough of this. It has caused problems in my relationships. Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Thank you. Okay. Where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Participant 1:
I don't really. I mean, I've seen people who are ... I mean, I've watched these shows on TV. Those people make me want to gag. I don't think I'm like that. I'm not like that. But I do know I have an issue with ... having a clean house and an orderly house. That's not me. That's not me, and I don't care. If I were having a party, and I used to have lots of parties, then I'd clean up and stuff. But I don't have parties and I go home and I like my alone time and I'm not really entertaining that much right now. And I guess entertaining would be some reason for me to clean up but otherwise, I don't care. I just don't care. I mean, I care enough to be a part of this study, but maybe I need to know why I don't care.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. yeah. Perfect. Thank you.

Interviewer:

Participant 1:
Okay. Okay.
