Participant 30:
Not really because I'm involved in a lot of organizations, but we've pretty much, a lot of things we do by Zoom meetings, and [inaudible 00:52:04] Normally we go a lot to concerts and theater, and so we're not able to do that, but I don't feel real deprived. My husband, to tell the truth, he'd be perfectly happy if he can just stay home and watch golf on TV and take naps. And go putter in the backyard, trim the bushes so it really hasn't, it's really not much different at all, except for him, I think he sort of likes it because I'm home more, but and it hasn't... Even though I can't do a lot of things I used to, I haven't felt any stress because of it, and I think being retired, if I were younger, I would be... I mean I can't imagine what it's like. 
One of the people in one of the organizations that I'm with, she just went off to college. Her end of her senior year, she didn't get to do any of the things that you normally do your senior year, and going off to college, even though she did physically go to, actually I think she went [inaudible 00:53:28] and as far as I know she's still there, but for somebody who is retired, you don't have to worry about losing your job or finding another job or juggling working at home with having kids at home. I feel like older people, well I think if you have someone else in the household, older people really can't complain if they someone else in the household. I do feel bad for some of my friends are single, and I think it's harder for them.
Interviewer:
Right, but you in particular, you haven't really noticed any sorts of impacts? How about with your acquiring habits? Like buying things or acquiring things for free, has that been changed at all due to COVID?
Participant 30:
No, I don't think it's changed a lot. I probably have bought... I don't normally buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, but I have lately. Just things that we need, just because it's easier than going to the hardware store or something.
Interviewer:
Right. How about your difficulties with throwing things out? Has being in the house more made that easier or made it harder?
