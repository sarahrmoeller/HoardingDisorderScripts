Interviewer:
No, no, no. With are done with our listing so why don't you go ahead and give me an example, because we're going to go now into just the portion of the interview that's more of a conversation.
Interviewee:
Okay.
For reasons I don't thoroughly understand, the State of Texas changed your driver's license requirements in terms of identification, and I don't ...
So [INAUDIBLE] goes on I don't ... I live I Texas so I see it here.
Now, failed to renew my driver's license for nearly a year and a half because they want the hard copy social security card, and I finally found my social security card two weeks ago and I was happy to come across it again.
The other 1950 stuff and it's still there, still have it but I finally found it.
So now I've got an appointment to go down and renew my driver's license.
Now, had I been able to RELEVANTLY find that social security card?
I would have my driver's license renewed some time ago.
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
So you were unable to find a really important document because you had saved so many documents and it actually ended up holding you up?
Interviewee:
Exactly.
So many different places to boot.
I got one in one stash and it just makes it so [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
What-
Interviewee:
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
That is a good example of where you might want a document and you just can't find it because you have so many.
Could you start out by telling me a little bit about how these problems developed?
When did you first notice these problems in your life?
Interviewee:
Oh, wow.
I'm not really sure.
I just, grew up with them.
Interviewer:
So your whole life.
Interviewee:
My father had them.
I can recognize that now but I didn't recognize it at the time.
So on a ranch and you seldom throw anything you way, you throw ...
Garbage someplace full of stuff and if you want it, you go look for it.
[INAUDIBLE] pull them up and do something else with the [INAUDIBLE].
That type of thing.
It's growing up On a ranch [INAUDIBLE] and you're [INAUDIBLE].
So I didn't recognize it as hoarding so much as keeping stuff.
But it's a part of the environment, I can GUESS...
Where you are determines if it's a problem or not.
To give you [INAUDIBLE] my brother brought it home to me, for us ...
I've got ... [INAUDIBLE].
SILENCE
