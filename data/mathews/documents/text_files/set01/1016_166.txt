Participant 16:
The chest beside the sofa is covered with stacks of books. I have one of those little tables that folds that people eat on. I forget what they're called. That's covered in books and journals and papers. 
And a chair in the corner has a big plastic box of art supplies, and on top of that is a pad of drawing paper, and on top of that is a cushy ottoman, and on top of that is a queen sized quilt that I need to have cleaned but I don't feel safe going to a laundromat, and on top of that are some papers and a winter jacket I washed that should be put in the closet where my winter coats are.
Interviewer:
Sounds like a lot.
Participant 16:
There's another table thing that has a bunch of magazines on the top, tchotchkes and stuff. Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. So going back to what you said, you said that you assigned one of your bedrooms that are supposed to be disposed of or given away.
Participant 16:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Why do you think you haven't be able to bring yourself to bring those items out since you've already separated them from the rest?
Participant 16:
Well, actually a big part of it is the pandemic. Because the clothes I had planned to take to a consignment store or just give to a thrift store. Those are nice, expensive clothes, just pass them on. 
I don't have trouble of letting go of things, generally, but those places are closed, now, and I don't want to just take this stuff to Goodwill.
Interviewer:
Right, okay.
Participant 16:
The books I had planned to sell at Half Price Books, the largest one in Austin, Texas is about two miles from me, and they have recently reopened, but I don't feel safe. The place where they buy back books is in the back of a huge store that used to be a grocery store.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 16:
So even with gloves and a mask, I don't feel safe in that space.
Interviewer:
Okay, so the pandemic has really hindered your ability to get rid of your items?
Participant 16:
Yes, yes. I would have... Like I said, I can get rid of stuff, but I feel stalled right now.
Interviewer:
Okay. Have you ever gone to a professional for help with this behavior?
Participant 16:
No, I've gone to therapy off and on since I was in my mid thirties. I have dealt with family issues, boyfriend issues, and just down to my basic emotions that I deal with. I still talk to a therapist by Zoom.
Interviewer:
Okay, but nothing about your problems with organization?
Participant 16:
No, no.
Interviewer:
And why do you think you haven't done that?
Participant 16:
Because I didn't identify that as a problem.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
