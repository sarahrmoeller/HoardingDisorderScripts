Participant 022:
Yeah. The first step is to go, "Well, look at this dress. This is so pretty and you bought this and it cost $150," and you were going to wear it to this party, but the party didn't happen or maybe you did wear it to the party, but you've never worn it again. What you have to realize is that, "No, you're never going to wear that again. You need to just give it to someone else who can use it." That's a hard step to take, I think, that first step. I've been going through my closet right now and I have two pairs of shoes in there that I bought before my son was born, and my son is 36.
Interviewer:
Oh wow.
Participant 022:
They're really nice shoes. I've never worn them. I put them in this pile to give to the charity. I think about how many times have I cleaned out my closet and I never would take those shoes out because I paid a lot of money for them and they're really pretty. It's not like they're out of style. They're just kind of plain shoes. When you're old like me them anywhere, it doesn't matter. That was a real big step for me to be able to do that.
Interviewer:
Yeah. No, that is a huge step in learning to clean.
Participant 022:
You have to do this thing where you have to cut your losses. Yeah. No, it's not going to happen. A promise is not going to be kept that you're going to finish the hand embroidered seat covers for all your dining chairs. You're not going to get it done, so you might was well just let them go. Let that go.
Interviewer:
Did your behavior upset you a lot?
Participant 022:
When I kept accumulating?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 022:
Oh yeah, oh yeah. All the time, all the time, because I couldn't find stuff. I don't know. I'm sure you've heard that from other people, but like, "Oh, I need this scarf to wear with this outfit but I can't find that scarf because there are 100 scarves here, so I'll just have to buy another one," that kind of stuff. It was really upsetting because you know you have something but you can't find it. This happened to me a lot in my life.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Did you think it ever got in the way of something you really wanted?
