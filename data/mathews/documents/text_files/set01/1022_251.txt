Interviewer:
Along those lines, and this is similar to the free listing, but do you think there's some way to tell someone has hoarding disorder without being exactly in their home? Maybe just by talking to them?
Participant 022:
Talking to them? No, I don't think so. I really don't. I think that most people, if they are true hoarders, they hide it. Does that make sense? I really think that they do, unless it's so totally out of control, but I think for the most part people ... Because you don't set out to be this, you don't set out to have this problem in your life, this extra stuff, but I think that it becomes overwhelming, but you hide it from other people as much as you can. I don't think you can tell usually just talking to people. I think to me, the one way that you can usually tell is by their car.
Interviewer:
Oh.
Participant 022:
If there's all this stuff in their car, "Why do you have all this stuff in here," like trash and stuff that you don't dispose of, that you should dispose of.
Interviewer:
Okay. Where did you get most of your information about hoarding disorder? Where did you hear about it?
Participant 022:
Where did I hear about it? You mean, live it? There was that show that was on TV, about the hoarders and I thought, "Oh my God, what kind of people are those," and all of a sudden, I think it made me realize, "Oh, that's what you are because look at your basement. Look at what you're doing and how you're not enjoying your life because you're so worried about people finding out about all this stuff." Does that make sense? I read some articles online about it, I think, is probably what I did. Yeah.
Interviewer:
Do you remember at what point in your life that was?
Participant 022:
I'm sorry, say that again?
Interviewer:
At what point in your life did that happen?
Participant 022:
Probably maybe about 10 years ago, 12 years ago. It took me a long time to come to grips with it really a long time. It's something I thought about. I think I have books on hoarding and organizing your life and stuff. I read them, but I don't do anything. I never pull it through.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Participant 022:
Does it really?
Interviewer:
I feel like that's a frequent response. A lot of people that I've interviewed so far, they've been like, "Oh, I have all these books and I read them all," and they're like, "But I didn't use it."
