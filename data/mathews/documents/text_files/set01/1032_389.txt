Interviewee32:
Hmm. I will say yes just kind of sort of not a huge amount.
But yes because I just...
Again I feel like I have more time and less going on in my life that gives me more space so I need to work on this problem and make some changes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And I know that you feel more socially isolated now because of the pandemic.
But prior to COVID-19, did you feel lonely?
Interviewee32:
Oh, yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah?
Interviewee32:
Yes, mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Okay, and have you experienced any conflicts during the coronavirus?
Interviewee32:
A conflict?
Interviewer:
Yeah, like either with other people or with yourself.
Interviewee32:
Oh, well I mentioned that two of my sisters are having what I think are some pretty whacked out ideas about who's orchestrating the COVID pandemic thing or whatever.
And so, I guess I could say there's a little bit of conflict there but we pretty much just don't talk about it.
And other than that, when I do go out to go shopping or whatever...
When you've got to do that sometimes, I forget...
Very often I forget to put the mask on before I get into the store or when I'm walking from the parking lot to the store it's like, "Oh, darn.
I've got to go back to my car and get the mask."
So, I mean that's my own inner conflict because I really... I mean who likes wearing them?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee32:
Gross.
They're a pain, yeah, to put on.
Interviewer:
Right, okay.
So, that was actually all the questions I had for you.
Interviewee32:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So, now I just need to collect some demographic information and then collect some information in order for you to get your gift card, and then we'll be all done.
Interviewee32:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So, as for demographics, your sex assigned at birth?
Interviewee32:
Sorry, say it again.
Interviewer:
Your sex assigned at birth.
So, female or male.
Interviewee32:
Female.
Sorry.
Interviewer:
You're good.
Interviewee32:
Cell phones aren't the clearest things for [CROSSTALK].
But anyway.
Yeah, female.
Interviewer:
And do you still identify as female?
Interviewee32:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay, your race?
Interviewee32:
White, Caucasian.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Do you identify as Hispanic and or Latino?
Interviewee32:
No. Interviewer:
Your household income?
You can just give me a general range.
Interviewee32:
I think it's about 50,000 a year.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Your geographic region?
Interviewee32:
Pacific Northwest of United States, yeah.
Interviewer:
And your highest level of education?
Interviewee32:
A college degree.
Interviewer:
Is that a bachelor's?
Interviewee32:
A bachelor's.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And then now I just need information in order for you to receive your gift card.
So, do you have a preference for physical or electronic gift card?
Interviewee32:
I don't have a preference.
It doesn't matter to me.
