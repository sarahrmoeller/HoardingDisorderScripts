Interviewer:
Okay. So you've never done any personal research? It's mostly just people casually talking about hoarding disorder?
Participant 013:
Yes. So yup, I really don't know. I couldn't really define it in clinical terms or anything.
Interviewer:
Okay. That's fair. This last section is kind of we'll be talking about the stress and if this behavior ever has upset you. Do you think that collecting all this stuff has gotten in the way of your daily life?
Participant 013:
Yeah, sometimes. I've been thinking even during this whole few months of being quarantined and home, if I didn't have a basement to go through and if I wasn't doing all this trying to get things organized and eBayed and stuff, I really would have time to be doing a lot more reading. I mean I'm retired, again. But I like to write. I could probably get some more writing done. There's other things I could do. But I don't feel justified being able to sit and relax and read a book or write an essay or something. Then when I think oh, the basement's calling me. 
So it would be nice and I do look forward to the day, if ever, that I'm done and I do have really that nice time. Like when we go away for the winter, because there isn't that, it's so nice, I get so much reading done. I take long walks, I have a lot of time to myself to do just nice things. But as soon as I get home, it's very yard to relax knowing that that's there and it's got to get done.
Interviewer:
Okay. Has there ever been a time where you feel like your behavior's really gotten in the way of something you've wanted? Or is it more of a day to day kind of gets frustrating?
Participant 013:
Yeah, it's a day to day frustrating. There's been times where I've been overwhelmed. Like I said with the moving. This is thinking to myself and really beating myself up. That I can't believe you're spending this kind of money and doing this much physical labor for a bunch of junk that you're going to finally someday go through and realize what are you doing?
But there's no way I could just have throw it in a dumpster or something. I would've probably gone off the deep end if I did something like that. Honestly, I just get stressed out even thinking of something like that. But there's been times where I've just been, you are just such a loser, what are you doing? You're spending so much time and money and hauling stuff around. I know it, I guess if I didn't know it, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. But I realize how bad it is.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 013:
So it just makes it hard.
Interviewer:
All right.
