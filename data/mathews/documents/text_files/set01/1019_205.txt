Participant 019:
Right. We're around people that are intelligent and caring, and can associate with them in our churches. My church is very thoughtful and I have a chance to get educated in many ways, going to New York City, when it opens up again, but still now, I just got used to Zoom. I have several Zoom conferences, I talk to people in Britain on Zoom. My life is very varied, I'm very happy about it. 
Interviewer:
That's wonderful. When you think about your house, how does your stuff fit into your house? So if you could paint me a picture of your house, not just of the house itself, but as the house with your belongings, what is that like? How does all of your saving fit into the space?
Participant 019:
Okay, so the garage is my little area where I keep all my tools and all the different project history that I have, with the auto mechanics and gardening and bicycling and all the cleaning of bicycles, the storage of supplies, paints. I painted my own house, by the way. Then the basement also, the steps going to the basement is a place for a lot of things, but things are stored on the shelves and things like that in disorganized ways. Boxes that I will think that I may need if I have to send something back that I have for a repair. Those are my storage areas. 
Our bedrooms, we recently, my wife encouraged me to go through and throw out clothes that no longer fit, and I've done that so our spaces for our storage of our clothes are very useful right now. Our bedroom is good, I keep the clutter of the various types of clothing stored well and under control. My bathroom, I clean regularly, so it's nice most of the time. Our bedrooms are beautiful, and with windows to look out around the woods around us. We recently restored our daughter's room, the daughter who has the bipolarity has moved out of state, but she left a mess room, so we recently just cleaned that up and repainted it. Very satisfying there. 
Interviewer:
It's interesting, because you talk about your stuff and the clutter, but also it's so clear to me that you take such pride in the space and the maintenance of the space. 
Participant 019:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Are there areas, it sounds like your garage used to be cluttered and the clutter is creepy back. 
Participant 019:
Yes, exactly. 
Interviewer:
But you have really taken care with repainting it and organizing. Are there places that you consider cluttered in your house?
Participant 019:
Yeah, the garage is coming back, because it's still a controlled mess. It could use a lot of improvement, figuring out how to dispose of old paint cans, of old paint, of the old auto mechanic tools, the bicycle gear.
