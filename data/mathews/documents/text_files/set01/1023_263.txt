Participant 23:
I mean, I'd be very upset. With photos. A lot of them are now digitized so you can replace them to some extent, but if they were like lost, I feel tremendous loss. I feel really sad. I'd feels a lot of anxiety and grief over the loss of that because as I said, I can't remember everything. And so having something visual that can take me to another time and remind me of things that I've experienced in different phases of life is very important. So I feel a very significant loss. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. I totally understand that. So really it would be a saddening experience that it would really truly feel like you had lost. 
Participant 23:
Yeah. I think a lot of distress, that's part of my anxiety and my over-attachment to things.
Interviewer:
When you're going through your items, how do you choose between your items and also how do you distinguish between trash and what's not trash and when it's time to throw something away? 
Participant 23:
Well, that's part of the problem. It's very hard for me to distinguish between things because there really are some things that are more important than others some more sentimental and yet I have a problem partying with the lower tier items that shouldn't be that difficult. Even old T-shirts that I don't wear anymore and that aren't really that important to me. It's very, very hard for me to part with them. So wait, you were saying, how do I... You asked a few questions about how do I choose-
Interviewer:
Yeah, exactly.
Participant 23:
I mean, that's the problem. I have trouble doing that, so I try to think of the things that are more special or they're most pleasing. I collect ceramics, and if there's a vase that I think is more aesthetically beautiful than another one, I'd probably, if I had to choose between them, I would get rid of the one I don't like as much whether the colors are different or the shape or something like that. But it's actually very hard for me to get rid of any of those items. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. 
Participant 23:
And then when do I actually get rid of things? I mean, sometimes it's juts that-
Interviewer:
How do you know when it's time to get rid of it?
