Interviewer:
So, the first section of the interview, I'd just like to hear from you about your experience with clutter problems.
It sounds like it's something that's been going on for a long time for you, so if you could just start by giving me a picture of what life has been like with these problems, when they started and how long they've been going on?
Participant 018:
Well, I started noticing 20 years ago when I had too much things that I did not want to look at again.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, the first time you really realized that you had problems was about 20 years ago, and you noticed because you had so much stuff that you didn't want to see again.
Yeah?
Participant 018:
Because I didn't want to deal with organizing it, figuring out what to keep, what to throw away, and how to use it.
Interviewer:
Sure.
So, that was when you started to feel that the behavior was a problem for you, because you really didn't want to be confronted with all of these things and the task of organizing them.
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How long had you been saving things at that point?
Participant 018:
Well, the 20 years.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, you noticed it was a problem 20 years ago, but the problem had kind of been going on for about 20 years before that?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How bad was the behavior when you started to feel that it became a problem?
Would you say it was a very severe problem in your life?
Would you feel that it was in the way of your daily life, or do you feel like it was a minor problem?
Participant 018:
Oh, man.
At that point it was just kind of in the way, but it didn't detract from anything I was doing.
Interviewer:
So, it was there, but it wasn't really interfering in your life?
Participant 018:
It's just that it was the sense of doom for the future.
It was more a...
Interviewer:
Anxiety.
Participant 018:
... anxiety for the future, because in the future I'm going to have to deal with all of this stuff.
Interviewer:
So, you were aware of it as a problem, and mostly, it caused problems because it made you anxious to think about the prospect of having to deal with it?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
What happened next?
How did you respond?
Participant 018:
Well, I wound up renting storage.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 018:
That was about when I started renting storage unit.
