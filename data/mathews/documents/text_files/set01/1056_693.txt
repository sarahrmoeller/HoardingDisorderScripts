Interviewee:
Well, do I have a use for it now? Do I know someone that has a use for it now? Might I have a use for it in the near future? Might I know someone who will have a use for it in the near future? Um, is it something that I can uh, realize um, financial reward for? In other words, is it something that’s sellable that someone else might have a use for and I can get rid of it by selling it to Craigslist, or is it something that um, has an appropriate place to be donated to, like um, the [place; ] or the [place; ] or whatever, where some of my stuff periodically makes its way to? Or, um, again, is it just something that holds sentimental value to me or is perceived by me to potentially hold sentimental value to someone else. So again, when you retain things from people that have moved on to a different plane of existence and it’s, you know,  antique-kinda stuff that’s interesting or intriguing or whatever, I hate to just toss it in the garbage even though it has no apparent use to me at this point in time. Just haven’t gotten around to finding it it’s proper home yet.
Interviewer: Right. So, do you ever disagree with your significant other or really anyone else about what might be sentimental or not, or what might potentially be useful?
Interviewee:
Um, only when she has stuff that she wants to keep but doesn’t want in her space. Something that gets sent to me.
Interviewer: Okay, so, why would you maybe think that something might be sentimental or that something might be useful if someone else didn’t think so? Have you ever like, had a situation like that where you really, truly believed that something was gonna be sentimental or useful in the future, or sellable like you said, and someone else didn’t agree?
Interviewee:
Actually, I can’t say that I have.
Interviewer: Okay, so usually people agree with you’ve determined that something is worth keeping?
Interviewee:
Well yes, it’s just that it… they may not… um… they may not have the same perception of whether it’s worth keeping up space with these items while you’re waiting to find what its use should be.
Interviewer: Right. Okay so, in terms of all your possessions, what do you think is probably the most valuable thing that you own?
Interviewee:
Hmm… hmm… I don’t know. I mean, I guess from a monetary standpoint my car! But as far as possessions in the house, there isn’t anything particularly valuable either financially or sentimentally that stands out above other stuff.
Interviewer: Okay, so if you were to lose any one thing in your possession, it wouldn’t particularly upset you?
