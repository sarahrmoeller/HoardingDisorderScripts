Interviewer:
And can you describe a time when you're high stimulation environment got in the way of something you really wanted?
Participant 48:
Well, I live in San Francisco, which is a high stimulus environment all by itself.
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 48:
There's so many different social activities that I would like to engage in.
So many different causes and [INAUDIBLE], great interesting things to be, do, outside your apartment.
So many different social groups with which to engage, that I don't engage with, or I engage with a lot less, especially less, because I always have to clean my room.
I always have things to do.
And I always think in two weeks I'm going to get it done.
There have been fissures with friendships because they'll invite me to their house, but then I'll never invite them.
They take offense at not ever being allowed, invited into mine.
It causes stress to my roommate, which means stress to me.
And the inspections are always literally the same thing.
We'll get the notice, I'll go into hyper mode, I'll make it and somehow magically make it passible by the next day, even though every single time, she looks at it and says, "There's no way you're going to do this.
No way."
And so far, every time I have.
Interviewer:
So your behavior's gotten in the way of you-
Participant 48:
Stress and anxiety.
Interviewer:
Yeah, your behavior's gotten in the way of you socially engaging the way you want to with others outside of your home and with your roommate, and it's upsetting.
Participant 48:
Yep.
And it affects me emotionally I'm sure.
When I look at it, it causes some stress and anxiety, because I recognize it as aberrance.
I recognize it as problematic.
And I'm embarrassed by it.
But it's like always here.
And I'll spend, I'll do literally physical labor, in spite of how sore and how much it affects your muscles when you spend a day, eight to ten hours, moving stuff and clearing out an area, mostly to no ultimate, no avail.
Interviewer:
Right.
Yeah, that's difficult.
Participant 48:
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.
It's frustrating.
Very frustrating.
Interviewer:
And so I know that you recognize that it's problematic and it is frustrating.
So would you like to change your behavior?
Participant 48:
Yes, very much.
I could do.
Tonight I will.
As soon as this phone call's over, I'm taking my behavior, I'm going to become a minimalist.
I'm going to get rid of all kinds of stuff.
And I'm going to live happily ever after.
Two weeks.
Interviewer:
That sounds amazing.
So I know you mentioned that, when you kind of welcomed your daughter into your world, as you said, that she was kind of anxious-
Participant 48:
There was a lot of apprehension there.
Interviewer:
Yeah, she was anxious.
Participant 48:
A lot of apprehension.
