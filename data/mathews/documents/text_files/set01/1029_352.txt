Interviewer:
Okay. So I have a few questions about your overall general functioning. Have you felt any change in your physical health, since the beginning of quarantine for you?
Participant 29:
Physical health versus mental health?
Interviewer:
I'm going to ask eventually about both of them. So how are you doing in both realms?
Participant 29:
Well physically, I'm actually doing better. Because I did decide at the beginning that I was going to have to take a walk every day. Otherwise, I knew I would sink into a depression if I didn't do that. Because I am prone to depression, I forgot, my doctor described it as dysthymia. Are you familiar with that?
Interviewer:
Yes. 
Participant 29:
So he has diagnosed me with dysthymia, and I thought, "You know, I'm not around people." I need a certain amount of time alone, but I also need time around people. And, I thought, I'd have to get outside and be more physical. So I walk my dog, then I put her in a baby carriage, and I take a brisk walk with her almost every day, five to six days a week. Sometimes I give myself one day off.
So physically, I think that has helped me. Oh, and not at the same time, I had already made the decision. But about two weeks later, I saw the Heartline study. Are you familiar with that?
Interviewer:
No.
Participant 29:
The Heartline study is a study that Johnson & Johnson and Apple are doing cooperatively. And, they're doing this study for three years to look at arrhythmia. So as part of the study, I could get a greatly discounted Apple Watch. And so I have to wear my Apple watch all the time, except while I'm sleeping. So it measures it. So, that's also given me some reason to continue. It's getting hard to go out for my daily walk, but I thought it can't be a decision. It just has to be something I do.
So physically I'm probably stronger, and I'm being measured by Johnson & Johnson.
Interviewer:
That's really cool that they're offering that, and it's helping you stay on track too with the goal you already had.
Participant 29:
Yeah. It makes me very aware of how much I'm doing. It measures your daily movement, it tells you to stand every hour if you haven't stood in that hour. You have to stand and walk around for a minute. And it tracks my outdoor workout. 
I started lifting weights at the same time, since this started, just hand weights. So I'm trying to take good care of my health more so, than I was before. But I was active before, and so now I'm not as active. So, that's what I'm doing to try to keep my physical health good. And I'm doing it for my mental health.
Interviewer:
Is it helping with the mental health as well?
