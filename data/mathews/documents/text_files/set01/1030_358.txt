Interviewer:
We're recording.
For the first part of this interview, I just want to ask before we begin talking about everything, what term do you prefer when we're talking about your issues with clutter or your hoarding?
Participant 30:
I don't think I'm a serious hoarder, you know, like you see on those TV shows, but I definitely have a clutter problem, and I definitely could see if it got worse, it could become more serious.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So you want to just use the word clutter problems then?
Participant 30:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, perfect.
That's going to conclude the first little section of the interview.
Now we're going to have more of a general conversation about how your clutter problems began.
That's actually the first question I'm going to ask.
Can you remember a point where your clutter problems began or maybe like why or when it started in your life?
Participant 30:
It was probably when, maybe when I was in my 30s.
A lot of the clutter was related to sewing and craft and hobbies.
Sometimes for sewing I like to go fabric shopping, and I would see something I really liked, and then get home and never get around to doing anything with it, and that would happen over and over, and pretty soon I have boxes and boxes of fabric, and kind of the same thing with other craft supplies.
Interviewer:
Was that mostly like in your early or late teens and early 20s or like maybe in college, as well?
Participant 30:
Probably like mid-30s.
Interviewer:
Mid-30s is when you would say it sort of began?
Participant 30:
Yeah, I think so.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How about now?
How has it changed throughout your life?
Participant 30:
Well I moved to a different state 10 years ago so I did get rid of a lot of stuff, but I've sort of found it creeping back up again.
Interviewer:
Is it generally the same sorts of things, like the sewing or have you kind of acquired more things in different categories?
Participant 30:
Mostly craft kind of things, and I also have a lot of papers, around the house.
I'm involved in, I've been involved in several organizations, and it seems like I go to meetings, and there's papers and I guess I'm always afraid to throw things out because I might need it so I have a lot of papers piled up.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Have you ever gone to a professional, say, for help?
Participant 30:
I don't think I need that.
Interviewer:
Do you see it as sort of like a problem in your life or just kind of a mild inconvenience?
