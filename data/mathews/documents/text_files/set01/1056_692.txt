Interviewer (15:43): Right. So, have you ever sought to change this behavior or has anyone ever suggested that you find help for this behavior?
Participant:
Well, I work on, as I’d say, periodically figuring out ways to strategically decumulate but, um… that, that moves at a slow pace. 
Interviewer (16:11): Right, so, never before have you—
Participant:
So, I’m, I’m not, the only way I would be seeking help would be to find the right place for these things to be distributed to.
Interviewer (16:26): Okay, but in terms of collecting things in general, you don’t really see it as a problem?
Participant:
Uh, I don’t. I mean I’m not actively accumulating things at this point in time.
Interviewer (16:43): Right.
Participant:
Just the management. It’s a, a space management issue.
Interviewer (16:49): Okay. So, in terms of the things that you do keep, how important are these things to you? So, why do they have value for you?
Participant:
I think um, in my opinion, my perception of their value is, uh, a result of what I perceive their intrinsic value to be. So, again, there are things that I’m not using, I don’t think I’m gonna use, but I think that they have a use, and it’s just a matter of finding the right, the right custodian for whatever that particular item is.
Interviewer (17:38): Okay. So, these things that you keep in your home, do they ever infringe upon the normal use of your home? So, is there any like rooms that you can’t necessarily move around too much in, or is there any appliances that you can’t necessarily use because there’s stuff on them? Or anything like that?
Participant:
Everything is accessible.
Interviewer (18:02): Okay.
Participant:
Although my office is, um, a little bit more challenging than it used to be when I had more space to disperse the stuff around the house. Um, but no, there is, there’s no loss of functionality anywhere in the home.
Interviewer (18:21): Okay. So, in terms of when you’re trying to determine when you should get rid of something or not, what kinds of values do you place on it to determine if you should throw it away? Like what makes something valuable enough to keep?
