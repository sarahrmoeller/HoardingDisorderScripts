Interviewer:
Okay. So how severe would you say that this collecting behavior is now? In other words, do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Participant 47:
I don't feel like I'm getting more stuff in, to tell the truth. It's like I just can't get the stuff that's here out. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so you just-
Participant 47:
I don't feel like-
Interviewer:
... you have a hard time parting with things. 
Participant 47:
Yeah, mostly with that. The collecting with the agates, they're tiny. They're in jars, so they're organized. They're not on the floor or anything like that. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 47:
But the other stuff, old stuff, my old memories are very hard. Both my parents passed away within the last two years. 
Interviewer:
I'm sorry to hear that. 
Participant 47:
Yeah, and I've actually ... So I acquired ... But unlike my brothers, who just sifted through and just picked a couple things, I ended up taking boxes of stuff back home. So now I have their stuff in addition to mine. It's very hard to not feel like I'm throwing them out when I throw out their stuff.
My sister also died. She died in 2000, but my mom kept her stuff. She made a point to tell me that I was supposed to keep it to. So even though she didn't like that I hoarded books, she wanted me to keep the stuff to kind of ... None of the stuff is heirloom or anything like that. Some of the stuff is in really shabby shape and really can't do much with it. But I almost feel like this obligation to keep it in the family, which my son said, when I die, this whole place is probably going to go up in smoke. 
He doesn't need the house and he doesn't need ... I try to actually clean things out because I don't want him to have to just take a big dumpster and just toss everything. I'm trying.
Interviewer:
So it's definitely ... What I'm hearing from you is that it's definitely the memories that make it hard, the sentimentality of not wanting to throw away your relatives in a sense.
Participant 47:
Yeah, but then it's more than that because, when I try to throw things out, I look at each item separately. Even if it's not functional, I think can I fix it? Can I reuse it, recycle it? Does someone else need it? I go through all these different processes with each thing, unless I'm in a mood where, like I said, the trash is going to be coming. I'm just like, okay, it's been here long enough. It's got to go. If I do it quickly and get it right into the trash the day before or the night before, and I can't go back in it or take it out. If I could do that and get that motivation, I can get stuff cleared out, and I feel so much better when I do. 
Interviewer:
Yeah.
