Participant 48:
Thus far, the 125 inspections that I've had in the 22 years that I've lived here, probably closer to 200.
But every time they've come in, it's never been actionable.
It's been embarrassing, but whatever.
But I've got sheets over the piles and clear walkways.
And I keep the walkways clear, for the most part.
Better than goat trails.
I mean, walkways that are [INAUDIBLE] or whatever.
And the kitchen and the bathroom are always spotless.
And like I say, there was nothing unsanitary, it's just that I have too much stuff.
It's clutter.
So my landlords, I mean, so far, if I saw the notice today, I would go into this hyper focus, hyper drama, high blood pressure, and I would scoop it up and form it and make it look passable, doing this nonstop overnight and then through the morning until  when they knocked on the door, walked in, looked around, and then, you know, they left.
Interviewer:
So there really hasn't been any conflicts with your landlord-
Participant 48:
It would be clean.
It would just be, yeah.
There hasn't been any conflicts.
Interviewer:
But what about-
Participant 48:
Any real conflicts [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
What about family?
Participant 48:
My family's scattered.
My daughter, 15 years ago was going to school here, and initially I let her into my world.
And initially she was anxious and kind of afraid of it.
But after a while, she accepted it well enough and interacted with us socially.
But other than my daughter, when my parents came to visit, I didn't let them into the apartment.
When friends come over, I have them in the lounge downstairs or at the terrace.
I don't let anyone in the apartment.
And that can be socially awkward at the very least.
And offensive sometimes to people.
Interviewer:
I understand that.
So do they know-
Participant 48:
My life is at times, but that's nonsense.
What?
Interviewer:
Do they know about this behavior?
Or because they've never seen it, they're not really aware?
Participant 48:
I think mostly they're not really aware.
Or I'll just say, the way I explain is, I have a roommate and there's not a lot of space, so we don't entertain company.
Interviewer:
Right.
I understand.
Participant 48:
I live in a apartment complex that has a lounge, has a terrace, has a courtyard, has other places that I can engage or entertain guests.
Interviewer:
So you mentioned that you live with your roommate in an apartment complex, and you've also mentioned you have three rooms, and your walkways are clear, but there are some areas of clutter.
So can you describe a little more what this space is like?
