Participant 042:
Oh my goodness. That's a hard question. I have lost a lot of stuff, because I gave up that one house. I said it's just stuff. "Just stuff." I did say that a lot. Now that people keep everything in their phone, it's almost like the phone is becoming... Because I can put a document in the phone and I can put a date, a time and something, wherever I assume it's gone, and I can keep the context, the list, the date, and times in the phone so I hate to say it, but I think it's becoming the phone.
Interviewer:
Honestly, that's quite modern times, I think many people would say that too. What would happen if you lost your phone?
Participant 042:
I've done that. It was like cutting your arm off. I was like, "Wait a minute, where's my phone." I had to get through that and cross the bridge when I came to it and make an order, go order a phone and the whole thing, report it, cut it down, shut it down, pray to get it back. It wasn't so long, but it was very torturous. Now I understand when people tell me that they're going through something like that. I really understand it.
Interviewer:
If you had to choose between your items, how would you choose? Let's say you had to choose between your phone or your gardening or something like that.
Participant 042:
How would I choose? You mean time use or use of item or how would I choose?
Interviewer:
Something has to go, how would you choose which item?
Participant 042:
Something has to go. Shoot. I might need to consult somebody. I might need help with that. I'd have to call up somebody and say, "Look, be ruthless with me and tell me what has to go." An outside observer who's objective would be helpful with that.
Interviewer:
Okay. That's interesting. This next section is going to be like distinguishing hoarding disorder and ideas of what it actually means to be diagnosed with hoarding disorder. What do you think are the most important differences between someone with normal saving behavior and someone with hoarding disorder?
Participant 042:
What are the differences?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 042:
Let me think about that. One difference might be... I think a distinguishing mark might be when it's ongoing and doesn't get better. It's hanging on. It's lingering. The person is kind of judged by your friends and family like you're not trying hard enough, but it's actually kind of putting all your energy into it and you're actually trying, but it looks like you're not trying. People are saying, "Wait a minute." That might be true. When it's ongoing is the main thing I can think of.
