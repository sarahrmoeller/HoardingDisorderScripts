Participant 29:
Totally. If I miss a day, I can even feel a little heavier, if you know what i mean by that.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I do.
Participant 29:
Yes. Absolutely. They said exercise is important for depression. And it has really shown me during this time, how much it's helping me. 
Interviewer:
I know that I lift weights as well. So whenever I do that, or whenever I go on a walk, even if it's a walk to talk on the phone with my parents, or a friend. It does help. It's like the description you used of heaviness is a very good one.
Participant 29:
Thank you.
Interviewer:
And it sounds like you are pretty comfortable financially before the pandemic. Has COVID-19 affected your financial stability at all?
Participant 29:
Not at all. No, I planned very well for my retirement. 
Interviewer:
You need to let me in on your secrets. It sounds like you're doing great. 
Participant 29:
Well, it's a really simple secret. I started saving when I first went to work. I always just had automatic payments put away, and then I got a good financial advisor who helped me with investing. And, I haven't had the ... I only had that one little period of needing to buy a lot of stuff. But, I buy quality furniture and it lasts a long time. I don't have the need to change it all the time, that sort of thing. 
So, it's really pretty simple. Always have some money taken out of your paycheck. And whenever I got a raise, I would put a pretty good chunk of the raise into my savings. Because I think I lived without it before, so I don't need to have it now. 
Interviewer:
You are saying the exact same things my parents have said, and somehow whenever, you know how when your parents say it you can brush it off. But whenever you hear it said by others, it clicks a little bit more. 
Participant 29:
Well I hope it clicked for you a little, because it has really helped me have a much more comfortable retirement than some of my friends who had to have new cars and new furniture every couple of years.
But it really adds up. And the small amounts add up. Like one of my neighbors is young, and I don't remember what happened, but she lost $10 or something like that, and she was like, "It was only $10." I'm like, "Well, every $10 adds up. 10 of those is $100"
Interviewer:
Yeah. You can't just let it go.
Participant 29:
So it's the little things. But I will tell you, because you're asking, I never felt deprived of anything. I didn't feel like I was missing out, or I have described myself as frugal, but never cheap. I always bought nice gifts for people, things like that. 
But, how much do you need after all?
Interviewer:
Right.
