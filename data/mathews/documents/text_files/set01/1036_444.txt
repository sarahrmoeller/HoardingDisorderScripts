Interviewer:
When you came out of your house and sold your house, was that distressing for you?
Did you have a hard time with that?
Interviewee:
It was very tough.
To this day I think I left stuff behind I think I should've brought with me.
Interviewer:
So you think about it?
Interviewee:
I went back, I went to Golden, I went back to visit a neighbor that we had, lat time I was there.
There's my house.
Well, it was my house, it's not longer my house.
Visit the neighbor across the street, nice guy.
He got older WOMEN buts till looking.
He can't pay the bank rates anymore, he doesn't have the lease for it.
But anyway, the garage door happened to be opened, I looked in the garage, and there's ... A lot of my stuff is still there.
The bench I had made was still there, the yellow cage metal cabinet I had was still there.
I could see a lot of my stuff was still there in the garage and somebody else was using it.
So I kind of felt like I wish I was using it but I'm kind of happy as I recognized, it was being used.
So it's mixed emotions.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
So you still think about the stuff that you left behind and some of it you wished you'd brought but it helped a little bit to see that it was still in use, but also and at the same time you wish that you had brought it with you.
Interviewee:
Kind of.
If I really had my wishes I'd still be healthy and happy in Golden.
My wife would be happy and healthy and around people and we would be one of these old couples wondering around that everybody giggles at [CROSSTALK].
Interviewer:
That's so tough.
Interviewee:
CROSSTALK sick reality is [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Well, it sounds like you are doing very well for yourself given the cards that have been dealt you.
It sounds like you really have a community there too between your family and then the Senior Center, which is nice.
Interviewee:
It is, it really is.
I feel blessed to be here.
Didn't have anything like that in Golden [INAUDIBLE] and I'm encouraged of couse every the most [INAUDIBLE] things change.
[INAUDIBLE] hard to [INAUDIBLE] back to work for about a year and a half before we both gave up, I was an engineer for him and I had to go back and look at the work they'd done on my file so I couldn't literally quite understand how they'd done this or that.
The only thing that made me giggle was they ended up splitting my department in half hiring three men to take my place.
Interviewer:
I guess that's a compliment when they have to hire three people to replace you.
