Then what is your household income?
You can say it in a range.

Okay.
Participant 041:

Interviewer:

So this next section of the interview is more conversation-style.
It's broken into a few different segments of topics relating to clutter-
Participant 041:
INAUDIBLE.
Interviewer:
So this first one is behavior and treatment-seeking.
If you could please describe your clutter problems and how long they've been going on?
Participant 041:
Since college, so like 2006.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 041:
INAUDIBLE, yeah.
Interviewer:
So you say it started when you graduated college or during college?
Participant 041:
During because I started college in 2006.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How severe would you say your behavior is now?
Participant 041:
I think it's very mild.
The worst it ever got was last year.
Yeah, last year.
For two, three months, I had a lot of stuff, so it was trouble to walk around, but for the majority of my life, it's been organized but just not being able to find things.
It wasn't messy where you couldn't walk around; it's just, I have a lot of containers to put things in, and everything was in a container, but it wasn't like like-with-like items.
It was like I would have pens one place, INAUDIBLE one place ...
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think your behavior is a problem?
Why or why not?
