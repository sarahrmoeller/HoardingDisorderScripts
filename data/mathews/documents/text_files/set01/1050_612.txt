Participant 50:
Yeah, because when I'm just trying to survive those friendships go out of the way.
And then of course people go, "Why didn't you call me?" Then your phone is broke either, but somehow how it's your fault that you did call them.
Interviewer:
Yeah, definitely.
Know what that's like.
Sure.
It sounds like also you have a group of friends who you have been friends with over a long period of time and because they kind of saw it develop.
Participant 50:
Yeah.
All my friends CROSSTALK.
Yeah, they're old friends, definitely.
Interviewer:
But there are still people who, you know you feel will judge you if they saw your space?
Participant 50:
Yes.
But not all, not the core.
Interviewer:
But your closest friends you're comfortable with.
Participant 50:
Yeah.
I mean, they haven't been in, in a while and they would be sad to see how bad it got.
But at the same time too, I know that they would want to help.
Interviewer:
Have you ever had conflicts with other people because of this behavior?
So this could be with friends or family or other people who are around your space, like landlords or neighbors.
Participant 50:
I never had any issues with my neighbors.
I wouldn't be surprised if the management of the office probably knows who I am and my situation.
But no, because no one's coming in.
I don't leave.
I live alone.
I've never lived with anybody except for my parents and my roommate in college.
Yeah, I have had some roommates, but there was no issue.
At that time I think everything had a place.
And it's just to the point now where everything does not have a place to have an idea of where I would like to put everything, but it's like the Japanese or Chinese lady that has Marie INAUDIBLE, who has that thing now, the tiding stuff, she's on Netflix and stuff.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Interviewer:
Uh-huh NEGATIVE.
I'm kind of out of the loop.
Participant 50:
Okay.
There's this lady that has a book if she has a CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
Oh yeah, the simplifier lady you're talking about.
Participant 50:
Yeah, and so everything.
And I think that's how I like to clean too.
It's like to pull everything out, but if I pull everything out, and I can't get it done, and it's worst than what it was before.
Does that makes sense?
Interviewer:
Totally makes sense.
Participant 50:
So I have all the piles from where I've tried and then I began to have to step over those tiles because I don't have time to complete the entire tasks.
Interviewer:
I totally understand.
Yeah.
Participant 50:
Either I get tired or need to go to sleep or something like that.
