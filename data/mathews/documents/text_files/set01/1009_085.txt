Interviewer:
Okay. So, you've seemed to lost maybe a few important things and-
Participant 009:
I may have lost a few important papers, but I can always... When it's time for taxes and stuff like that, I'm able to do that. I'm able to find everything I need and I do run my own wedding officiant business and I always have my contracts and that kind of stuff in order. So, I keep things under control, but like I said, I have all these spaces that I'm not able to use anymore.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, you said your behavior isn't too severe, do you think it's a problem though?
Participant 009:
It's feeling like a problem because I'm beginning to worry that, you know, I'm older and I'm having friends to pass away and I'm thinking, "Oh my God, if my son had to deal with this, if something happened and he had to deal with this this would be awful for him." And like I said, I would not let my friends look at my closets or my basement or anything like that 
Interviewer:
Okay. So, have you ever sought professional help with this behavior? 
Participant 009:
No. 
Interviewer:
No? Okay. 
Participant 009:
I have not. Not with this. 
Interviewer:
Has this caused any conflicts with your family and friends?
Participant 009:
No, because I hide it pretty well. My husband knows not to open the closet door, go in my closet. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So, your husband doesn't touch any of the storage spaces?
Participant 009:
Well, he uses the tool room and he uses the laundry room so that's where I try to make sure that he can get access to when he needs to get access to them. 
Interviewer:
Has this ever really upset him? Have you guys got in arguments over this?
Participant 009:
No. 
Interviewer:
No?
Participant 009:
No. No. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 009:
He pretty much respects my privacy, so. And like I say, I keep the areas that we use together fairly clear.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, what would you like your home to look like then in an ideal world?
Participant 009:
I'd love for my desk to look clear. I would love to feel if I want something I know where it is, I can get to it easily. I would like to feel like I'm unburdened with some of the stuff I keep is probably things I'll never use again, if they don't fit me, you know clothing that doesn't fit, things like that, and I'd really like to feel more spacious. It's a feeling kind of like this stuff is making me feel crammed. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So, you're kind of starting to feel claustrophobic so you want more clarity, more space, and more organization?
Participant 009:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
So, how important are your things for you to feel at home? Are there objects that you spend a lot of time with?
