Interviewer:
Okay. That makes sense.
Then I think we've touched on this before, but if you had to get rid of some of your things, would that upset you?
Interviewee:
Somewhat.
Interviewer:
Somewhat?
Interviewee:
Somewhat, although, the answer flies in the face with why haven't I?
You've asked some interesting questions the psychiatrist, psychologist might ask.
Why can't I?
Why can't I?
Go ahead.
I've lost the train.
Interviewer:
Oh, that's okay.
I was asking if you would be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items, and you said somewhat.
Interviewee:
The thing I wouldn't be upset about, maybe not right then, but when I really needed that down the road a piece, then I would be very upset that I had given it away.
Interviewer:
So if you worked on something down the road, and then you didn't have the thing that you got rid of, that would be upsetting?
Interviewee:
Uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.
I knew that I had it, but I'd given it away because I didn't need it right then, but when the time came to use it, it wasn't there.
I didn't have it.
That would make me very upset.
So I keep it.
Interviewer:
So that in case the situation arises, you'll have it?
Interviewee:
Uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I think in a second, I'll just ask a few demographic questions, but I think that's all my questions specific to hoarding disorder and clutter problems that I have.
Was there anything specifically that you felt that we should know that I didn't ask about?
Interviewee:
Nothing jumps out at me.
No. This is where I think of them later.
You know, the questions on the ...
Name as many animals as you can.
After I get past anaconda and every kind of snake I can think of, my mind goes blank, and I can't think of anything.
That's kind of the way it is here.
Interviewer:
That's okay.
I appreciate, again, all of your time.
We just have a few demographic questions, and then I'll just recap what we had talked about real quick, and then I'll let you go.
So again, with these demographic questions, the same thing applies.
If there are questions that make you uncomfortable or things that you don't want to answer, you can just indicate that you would prefer not to answer that question.
We can skip it.
So the first one is highest degree of level of school that you've completed.
Interviewee:
I have a master's degree in home economics education.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Home economics education.
Interviewee:
I decided when I got into it, I didn't like teenagers.
Interviewer:
Ah, okay.
So you started off teaching, but you didn't like teenagers?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
I get that.
I used to teach middle school myself.
The next one is what would your household income qualify as?
I can give you some brackets if that would help.
