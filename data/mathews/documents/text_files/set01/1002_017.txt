Interviewee:
I mean, my laptop cost me a lot, I do a lot of work on that. My dog is, when it comes to living things. A lot of my stuff is boxed up in the garage right now, because when I moved in with my parents, I just put all of my stuff in storage. I don't really have access to too much of my stuff.
Interviewer:
If you did to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?
Interviewee:
Probably how much time I use it.
Interviewer:
Okay, time.
Interviewee:
Electronics are first, and then...
Interviewer:
Would you say expensive items are more of a priority in that sense, or is it just time?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I mean because I use my iPad and my laptop every day, my phone. I've been moving from hard copy books to Kindle books because of my hands. Its just easier to hold a Kindle than it is to hold onto books, it's a problem to hold books all the time. A lot of my movies are now digital copies.
Interviewer:
Does your behavior upset you in any way?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I mean, I try to avoid looking at the floor. Because I don't care for the disorganization, but I also don't care enough to do anything about it.
Interviewer:
Okay, so would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want to have to like the idea of it doesn't feel too... If I had to rent a storage unit and if I couldn't afford it, that would upset me. I got real lucky when I had to move in and my parents had a little portion of the garage to fit all my stuff, even though they can't stand it.
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay, so we're going to move onto the next section here. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Hoarding is when you can't get rid of things, so not only do you collect, but you have a time a hard time letting go. To the point that your house and living areas become a mess, and you don't have much of a social life, or you can't have people over because your place, there isn't much room, or things like that. When I had my own little apartment, I wasn't able to have people over too often because it was real crowded with stuff.
