Interviewer:
So tell me about where you live now.
Interviewee:
I live in Cypress, Texas.
I live in a single family home in the recent development called Bridgeland.
It's one of the biggest ones in the area.
My son-in-law was the project manager for this development and the company he was with fell on hard times, it's a bit of a story and you can probably remember when Sears bought Kmart.
Kmart had [INAUDIBLE].
There was kind of a similar thing and-
Interviewer:
And you live in a room in their house?
You live with-
Interviewee:
I have a room in her house but the [INAUDIBLE] my son-in-law was ...
He was a manager for the project that built this development.
The roads and stuff to Cypress, they were his designs, but anyway, it's a new ownership of the company, they have strong differences and now I get in the story too much.
Anyway, he's done what he's required to do and he has his own company now.
Interviewer:
That's great.
Interviewee:
He's a developer.
But my biggest heartburn is how much he wastes money.
Interviewer:
What do you mean by that?
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE] good point.
Now one bedroom and we're asked to [INAUDIBLE].
It's a four bedroom house.
I have one.
There's two and half beds on the first floor, there's two and a half beds on the second floor.
There's a CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
Did you say ...
Interviewee:
I don't go upstairs very much, [INAUDIBLE] stairs but I have a room-
Interviewer:
So you mainly just have your room downstairs?
Interviewee:
I'm sorry?
Interviewer:
You mainly just have your room.
Is your room cluttered now?
Interviewee:
It's not so cluttered that I can't walk around, but it is cluttered because every horizontal space has stuff on it.
Do you do FaceTime?
Interviewer:
No, not for this interview but that would be interesting to do for a future interview to see your space, yeah.
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE] tried to take a video [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Well, why you don't you try describing your room for me?
What kinds of stuff have you saved and where is it located?
Interviewee:
I've got a closet full.
I've got stuff.
I have a couple boxes in the garage of stuff, but I have several boxes of stuff upstairs in the attic section and I have a bedroom that's maybe, I'll just say, 18 by 24 maybe sectioned it up, and [INAUDIBLE] length of the window.
So I have stuff by every horizontal surface.
Interviewer:
What kind of stuff do you have in your room?
Interviewee:
I have extra drawers, I have boxes.
Some of the DIED objects and I want to give that away.
There's also a computer, monitor, keypad, and mails.
It's ordered, sorted, filing cabinets and a little set of storage desks.
