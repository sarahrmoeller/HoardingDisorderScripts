Participant 25:
No. I mean we just have the normal type of stress that probably everybody does with something like this. We're just all sick of it. 
Interviewer:
Sick of it, and finances. It's impacting every avenue of life.
Participant 25:
Yeah. Well and you can't even go to a restaurant and it be normal anymore because they've all reduced their menus and some of the restaurants we used to love we don't go to anymore because their food is horrible now, and it's because they're running at a reduced staff and it's reduced capacity. We used to go to Walmart all hours of the night. Now you can't even, you have to plan your trips to Walmart because they close at 8:00 every night. It really is an inconvenience.
Interviewer:
Yeah it's impacted everything.
Participant 25:
Yep.
Interviewer:
This brings me to the end of the questions that I have for you. Do you feel that there's anything more you want to discuss, or any questions you have?
Participant 25:
No. No I really don't.
Interviewer:
Well I hope I didn't bother you, or talk your ear off.
Participant 25:
No, no that was fine. [crosstalk 00:58:48]
Interviewer:
I do have a few questions. I'm going to end the recording now.
