Participant 29:
So that's how I did this. 
Interviewer:
How do you think that ties into ... Because you seem to have a very minimalist view on the items that you intentionally acquire. Is it the items that you have that have accumulated? Are those items that are mostly given to you by others?
Participant 29:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 29:
That is [inaudible 01:05:34]. Yes.
Interviewer:
That was something I probably should've clarified earlier on. But, we got the gist throughout the whole interview of that.
I have a couple more questions if you still have a few more minutes?
Participant 29:
Yes, I do.
Interviewer:
It seems like during this time, the past four months, you've found comfort in exercise as well as your volunteer work. Is that true and also is there anything else that's brought you comfort?
Participant 29:
That is true. And yes, my dog. I don't know how I would've made it this far without my dog, because I adore her. She's a six pound teacup poodle. And like right now, she's sitting on my lap. She always wants to be with me, and when I'm needing a hug, I just lift her up to my chest, and just tell her, "I have to have a hug."
So she has brought me the most comfort for sure. I do make a phone call to someone almost every day, because that's my way of connecting to people. And I talk on FaceTime to some family and friends. So, that has helped me. ... Was that the question? I'm sorry, was the question, how am I-
Interviewer:
How are you finding comfort during this time? Which was very general and you've answered it very thoroughly. Yeah. So you mentioned your exercise, your volunteer work, that you're staying in touch with friends and family, like probably about once a day.
Participant 29:
Yes. Well one person, I make sure I call ... It's not always the same person. I'll choose someone to call. The other thing is that brings me a lot of joy actually is sometimes we have driveway meetings in the neighborhood. 
Interviewer:
I love that.
Participant 29:
Not enough, because it's so hot. But before it got this hot, we did it a little more often. Sometimes we would bring our own chair and drink, and we would do our distancing in the driveway. 
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 29:
It's not happening as much, but whenever it can happen, I'm right there. So those are the things. 
Interviewer:
That is awesome to hear about the sense of community there, that people want to do that.
Participant 29:
Yeah, there's a lot of nice people in my neighborhood. I'm lucky.
Interviewer:
And I have one more question for you, and that relates to, did you feel lonely or isolated prior to quarantine happening? And then following quarantine, has that feeling changed?
