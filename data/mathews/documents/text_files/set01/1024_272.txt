Interviewee4:
Yes. And almost, I would say almost every other day, I say, I've got to get rid of this and I got to go through this and so forth.
So it's on my mind a lot.
And it has been since it started to pile up, so I'm like...
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So it's something that you're actively trying to change.
Interviewee4:
Yes.
But I never quite make it.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And have you ever gone to somebody to get help to change your behavior or to change your clutter?
Interviewee4:
No. Mm-mm NEGATIVE.
I've read about it.
You know, there's books about how to clean out your clutter.
And I have probably two or three of those and I've read through them, but that doesn't do much help.
I mean, it tells you what to do and I think, yeah, I know how to do that.
It's just that I'm not doing it.
Interviewer:
What do you think is getting in the way of you being able to organize?
Interviewee4:
What do I think is getting in the way?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewee4:
Well, I think I've said that, I have too many interests and want to keep things.
And then when I start going through things, I don't really get rid of that much stuff.
There's a lot of stuff out in the garage.
Let's say that came from my mother, that was my mother's.
Why do I need to keep it?
So it's an emotional thing and I go through that and I think, "Oh, well, I'll throw some of this away."
And let's say there's 20 items.
I'll throw one away.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So when you go through your items, you end up deciding to keep them a lot of the time.
Interviewee4:
Yeah.
I ended up moving it from one place to another.
Yes.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Have you ever had, do you have friends or family or anybody else who's involved with your life give you feedback on your cutter clutter problems?
Has it ever caused conflict for you?
Interviewee4:
No, because the people that...
Interviewer:
Do you live alone now?
Interviewee4:
I don't have any children so then there's nobody that close to me.
Several of my friends at this point have passed away, but that's not an excuse because they were around for a long time.
And some of my relatives, like aunts or cousins are not in my area.
They're not near me.
And they say, "Oh, I'll come up and visit you."
I give them an excuse, why they don't want to come up and visit me.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Okay.
So you don't have that many people in your home.
Interviewee4:
Pardon me?
Interviewer:
You don't have that many people in your home normally.
Interviewee4:
Correct.
That's right.
