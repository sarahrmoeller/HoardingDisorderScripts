Participant 46:
No, I'm not taking any medications at all anymore, except Synthroid, but that's a different thing. Anyway, at that... May have some, who knows. But anyway, so initially they started me on Prozac, but I became violent. I mean, really violent. I was normal for a month or six weeks, and then suddenly I got the strength of Hercules, lift up a bench. I actually picked up a bench which weighed about 80 pounds and threw it out the front window. That's how mad I was getting.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Participant 46:
Yes, even I could be-
Interviewer:
You must be very strong. 
Participant 46:
Yeah, very strong. I was like, "Where did this come from?" And I knew it was the Prozac, so I got off of that, and then the gave me Alprazolam, and then they gave me... There's a couple of others they gave me. If I see them I know them. Some other things.
Interviewer:
Did you-
Participant 46:
I know they gave me Ritalin at one time, the generic form of Ritalin, and tried a couple of other things.
Interviewer:
When did you stop taking any of these-
Participant 46:
About ten years ago.
Interviewer:
Ten years ago. Have you-
Participant 46:
I broke up, by the way. I broke up with my other half 10 years ago.
Interviewer:
Yes, I remember you saying that.
Participant 46:
So that, I stopped taking it 10 years ago, because I figured I had to work on myself, and then my psychiatrist died, he passed away. So-
Interviewer:
You didn't think the medications were helping you with the self-improvement. 
Participant 46:
I think it wasn't helping me with the hoarding at all. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 46:
It did calm me down if I was having some kind of, not OCD, but episode. I would find I was screaming at my ex. It did calm me down, but then I always felt like I was in a fog, like I was underneath something-
Interviewer:
Yeah, that's very common. I know a lot of people feel that way. 
Participant 46:
... being held down. And then when I stopped taking it I felt like me again, but then you had to live with me. So the chances of living with me are not... You know what I mean? Are good, so-
Interviewer:
So now would you say your problems with hoarding are comparatively over the course of your lifespan, and when you were on medication, when you were with your ex, would you say that they're better or worse than they used to be, or about the same?
