Interviewer:
Okay, so as you know this study is investigating individuals attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. So, the first question would be, what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding? 
Participant 32:
What term?
Interviewer:
Yeah, like some people are okay with hoarding disorder. Others prefer problems with clutter. 
Participant 32:
Oh. No, I'm not self-conscious about this kind of stuff. But yeah, I don't know if I really have hoarding disorder but I know I'm a clutter... I call myself a clutter bug. So yeah, whatever.
Interviewer:
Okay, great. So, now we are going to move into the section of the interview that's a little bit more conversational so it'll just be like a Q and A. I'll ask you a question and then you can answer in any way that you feel comfortable with answering. So, this first section is about behavior and treatment-seeking. So, could you please describe your clutter problems for me?
Participant 32:
Okay. One of my problems is that I don't seem to have a system for dealing with my mail. When I get mail, I'll open it, I'll read it and I'll set it down. I'll put the envelope in the recycle bag and then I'll put whatever the contents of the envelope was just in a pile. And so, sometimes... Yeah, so my correspondence or communications, the paper ones at least, are not well organized and sometimes I'll miss paying a bill or miss an appointment or something because I have buried the piece of paper that told me about it under other pieces of paper. Okay, I'm sorry, would you repeat the question again?
Interviewer:
Yeah, of course. Could you please describe your clutter problems? 
Participant 32:
Yeah. So, it seems like every horizontal surface in my house has stuff on it and yeah, it's just clutter. Yeah, I just don't like that. I want open space but I need to... I want a place for everything to be or to give away or sell or whatever. So, yeah. My garage and various rooms in my house... I mean, mind you, I did just move in a couple months ago, so I'm still unpacking. But it's taking me a lot longer than I think it should. So, I keep finding other things to distract me and keep me from making the decisions about where to put things when I take them out of a box. So, life is not as smooth and comfortable and it's not organized very well as it should be or I want it to be. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, and how long has this been going on for?
Participant 32:
I'm sure it's been going on for... Well, at least since 2001 so however many years that is. That's what? Let's see... It's 2020 now, so 19 years. Isn't that right?
Interviewer:
Yes, and-
