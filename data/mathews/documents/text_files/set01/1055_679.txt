Participant:
Well, my husband is embarrassed for anyone to come to our house, so we can’t have friends over. It changes your life as far as being able to have relatives or anyone come to your house, or just to get some work done in your house is a panic.
Interviewer (8:51): Right. So, have you ever sought to change this behavior, like going to professional? I think you mentioned earlier that you had tried going to get help before.
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer (9:03): Okay, and how did that go?
Participant:
Well, I mean, um, I went to a psychiatrist, he put me on medication. Went to, uh, was it a psychologist? Anyways, it was someone that you talk to. And, his, his idea was to try not to do it. And all that did was put more stress on me to try not to do it. It's easier just to do.
Interviewer (9:37): Right.
Participant:
Do the thing you need to do.
Interviewer (9:41): Okay, so he kind of told you that it was better to just not do it at all. He didn't sort of give you any like coping mechanisms or anything?
Participant:
No. He was just mostly, you know, try not to do it, and then that was more stressful.
Interviewer (10:00): Right. So, during that time when you were, you know, in therapy for that and you were trying to follow his advice, and it was making your life more stressful, what did that look like? Did it make your hoarding worse? Did it make it slightly better? Or did it create new strain in your relationships, or anything like that?
Participant:
Just put more stress on me. It made things harder where it was just easier to do things the way I've always done.
Interviewer (10:31): Okay, so you did try and actively follow his advice, but found yourself falling short? Or, you kind of more so, didn’t know how to do that, so you just kind of kept on doing what you were doing?
Participant:
I tried, but it just, it just wasn’t working. It was too much stress. It was just easier to do things the way I always have.
Interviewer (11:04): Right. So, this psychiatrist that you went to, how did you hear about him? Or how did, how did you find this person?
Participant:
I think I went on the internet and found him.
Interviewer (11:17): Okay. So, did you search for specific psychiatrists for hoarding disorder or just psychiatrists in general?
Participant:
For hoarding disorder.
Interviewer (11:29): Gotcha. Okay. So, you went on the internet then, but it wasn't like a recommendation by anyone else right?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer (11:39): Okay, so, um, I want to go back to, when you were saying earlier that your husband was embarrassed about, you know, the hoarding and it, you know, created some strain there. I want to talk about how maybe your family, or your friends feel about your behavior.
