Participant 25:
Well my mother, like in 2012, maybe eight years ago when I actually did that, when I went up there and spent a week decluttering her apartment. Then the years the followed we had a sequence of moves that brought her eventually back to Texas. Then she died last year, but she was in a home. It was in stages because like in 2012 she was in a duplex, like a two bedroom two bath duplex, and then she moved into an over 55 retirement community into a two bedroom apartment, which was a little bit smaller, so I had to downsize her then. Then when I moved her back to Texas I moved her into a one bedroom non-assisted over 55 retirement apartment. 
I had to downsize her just to get her stuff back from Philadelphia to here. It was a process over four or five years. Then ultimately she ended up having to have 24/7 care, so she was in a home, so she didn't have any of her belongings, other than just clothes. That's when I had to sell the furniture and dispose of everything that was hers, other than what I was going to keep and I still have some of that stuff like the pictures and papers and things that I still need to go through. I still have some of my grandmother's stuff that she had in boxes that I need to go through all that. It's just a lot of stuff.
Interviewer:
It compounds, yeah.
Participant 25:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Interviewer:
I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. I know that can be very difficult, going through all that. 
Participant 25:
Thank you. Yeah she died on 9/11. Last year was a tough year but I didn't have any idea what this year had in store.
Interviewer:
I was about to say, I don't think it got much better.
Participant 25:
I know. We haven't had any deaths in the family, so that's good, because we had three deaths in the family last year. This year has been bad on a whole different level.
Interviewer:
Yeah different way.
Participant 25:
Yeah, yeah.
