Interviewer:
How have you coped with COVID?
You said that you're not that social so maybe you haven't experienced feeling isolated or neglected from not having as much social interaction, would you say that's true?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Since I don't socialize it really hasn't impacted me at all.
What does impact me about COVID is watching the T.V. news.
That will make me depressed but it's not the type of depression that incapacitates me, I just feel very low and very unhappy for the people who are either losing loved ones due to the virus or just the circumstances that they have to accept because of somebody in their family that has COVID.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
It's the T.V., kind of the media, has maybe had more of an effect on you negatively?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How have you dealt with that?
Do you just stop watching it now?
Interviewee:
No. I'll watch it but if it's really hard to take I'll just get up and leave the room.
Interviewer:
How about your-
Interviewee:
[NAME] watches the news.
Interviewer:
I was going to ask how about your partner, how does she feel similarly about COVID or is she a little more-
Interviewee:
No, she's been affected more by it because she sings in a church choir.
She doesn't go to church because she's a church goer, she goes because she loves to sing.
She belongs to the church choir and they, all these choir members are interesting since the church doesn't convene they really missed the singing so they have been meeting up in a parking lot or some place up at the church and singing in the evenings.
They social distance and they stand out there and sing.
Interviewer:
Right.
Well, that's nice, at least.
Interviewee:
Things like that.
And she's involved with refugees that have settled in our community.
It used to be that she took these people to go grocery shopping or to go to where they could get free foods and stuff and now she's pretty much, not pretty much, she does it by herself because they know who she is and who she's getting the food for, and then she just leaves the bags of food at the front door of the houses where these people live.
So, it's affected her more because of her involvement in the community than it has me.
Interviewer:
Gotcha, because she's more community involved, more social, it's affected her more.
You kind of doing your same sort of gig per usual?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Great.
