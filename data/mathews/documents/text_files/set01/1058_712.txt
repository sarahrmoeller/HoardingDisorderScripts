20:43 Interviewer:
And  What would happen if you lost your Christmas ornaments? Like, is that something that you collect? Or do you have like a quote normal amount of them? 
Participant:
I think it's a normal amount. 
20:59 Interviewer:
Okay. Um, so what about, like all of your newspapers and papers. What happened, what would happen if you lost them?
Participant:
the scary part is I wouldn't even remember it. 
21:48 Interviewer:
Um, okay. So, you don't think that you would be affected that much? 
Participant:
See like this so much. I wouldn't even remember it. That's how ridiculous this whole thing is okay.
21:27 Interviewer:
And do you think that you have too much stuff?
Participant:
Oh god, yeah.
21:34 Interviewer:
And how do you decide when you have too much.
Participant:
The house. It has things on places that like this chair in this den oh my god. It’s stacked up about three feet and that is not what a chair is supposed to be for. Using things like the bed isn’t supposed to have 
Spaker 1 22:01- So just like when things aren't being used as they're supposed to be used and instead they're being used as storage space.
Participant:
right. 
22:09 Interviewer:
Mm hmm. Okay, um, And if you have to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Participant 058 22:21 
Oh my god. Probably keep what means like if it; who it reminds me most of, I think, 
22:32 Interviewer:
Okay, so it's going back to that like sentimental value.
Participant:
Like I know my sister in law gave me that and my best friend gave me that. 
22:41 Interviewer:
Okay. Um, so now we'll move on to the next section, which is about distinguishing hoarding disorder. Um, what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder? 
Participant:
I’m thinking when its not kept like it [unclear] its not in any organized fashion. Although, I'd say I treasure all this stuff. I may have the same type of item in 10 different places and I cannot quickly find where it is like if it meant that much. Why is it scattered and in such disarray? Like why can’t I organize it? 
23:34 Interviewer:
So there's just like a general sense of disorganization and not being able to find things that even though you have several of you can't locate them 
Participant:
Right
23:49 Interviewer:
And is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without being in their home?
Participant:
No
23:59 Interviewer:
No?
Participant:
Not unless its spilled into the yard. I wouldn't think so. 
24:04 Interviewer:
Okay. Um, and where do you, if you do, where do you get information about hoarding disorder like where have you heard of it?
Participant:
This is ridiculous. They have a show on, have you seen hoarders?
24:19 Interviewer:
Yeah. On like TLC?
