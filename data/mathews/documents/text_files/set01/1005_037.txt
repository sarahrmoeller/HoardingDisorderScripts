Interviewer:
Yeah. That makes sense. I'm going to go ahead and read the next scenario. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When the items are delivered to his house, he keeps the containers the item came in because he's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.
Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
Similar to the previous scenario, I'm asking you the same question as do you think this person has hoarding disorder or do you think their behavior is more like a clutter problem and why?
Participant 005:
This sounds more like a hoarding behavioral issue because now that future need, even if it never comes to fruition, is completely occupying his whole life as opposed to a single closet. It's impacting his ability to function on a day to day basis.
Interviewer:
Do you think for this person should they seek treatment or should they seek some kind of resource to help change their behavior?
Participant 005:
I would say yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Would you say that this behavior is similar or different to your own in this scenario or why or why not?
Participant 005:
I don't believe mine is ... I think I have some of those attributes but more along the lines of a closet, even though it's not limited to a single closet. It doesn't impact my ability to function every day.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 005:
It is similar but not nearly as ... John Doe's is much more extreme.
Interviewer:
Okay. I'm going to read the next scenario. John Doe has boxes of papers that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. These boxes of paper occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bath tub and sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until eventually he finds them. When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.
Same question, do you believe John Doe in this scenario has more of a clutter problem or do you think it's more serious?
Participant 005:
For these questions, you are, in fact ... If I'm understanding it, you're drawing a distinction between a hoarder and somebody with a clutter problem or someone that's messy?
Interviewer:
Correct.
Participant 005:
Is that correct?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 005:
Okay. I'm not sure what the pieces of paper are but I don't think this is clutter. I think this is a problem. I think this is more of a hoarding issue.
Interviewer:
Okay. Is there a reason why this one is or is it similar to the previous example for you?
