Interviewer:
Okay. So, I'm going to read you the next one and we're going to kind of go through the same questions. So, this one is John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decided to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He's worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for him to walk in his house. Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all. So, do you think this person has hoarding disorder or is the behavior more like clutter problems?
Participant 009:
He's definitely got a hoarding problem. 
Interviewer:
Should this person try to change the behavior, and why or why not? 
Participant 009:
Yes. It's impacting his life in a pretty negative way.
Interviewer:
Do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 009:
Probably. 
Interviewer:
How is this one similar or different from your own behavior?
Participant 009:
Well, I don't have any problem doing things I need to do so it's very different as far as that goes. I'm never later for anything. I'm usually early, and it's like I don't have to move things to get in another room or anything like that.
Interviewer:
All right, and there's two more, so we're on our third one. So, this next one is John Doe has a lot of craft items that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. Crafting supplies occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10, 20, minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be. So, for this one, do you think he-

Interviewer:
Oh.
Participant 009:
Go ahead.
Interviewer:
Okay. It's the same question so if you already know you can answer.
Participant 009:
Oh. Yeah, I would say he definitely has a hoarding problem and would need to get help. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So, and you think it would require treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 009:
Yeah.
