Participant 45:
Using it up is the way to get rid of things.
Until it's the shoes half falling apart then even I realize ... I mean, I took a pair of shoes to a shoemaker recently and she says that, "No, there's no way we can save these.
We can't put new heels and stuff on them.
It just can't be done.
They're gone".
Interviewer:
And that's when you decided to throw it away?
Participant 45:
No, I found a way of rebuilding the bottom with shoe glue.
I didn't throw them away and now I'm locked in but I need one more shoe glue and I think I can build it up and use them longer.
The tops were in very good condition.
It's just the bottoms came apart.
Interviewer:
So does something have to be I guess basically everything is falling apart for it to be thrown away for you then?
In regards to shoes or clothes and stuff?
Participant 45:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 45:
I can comfortably, to comfortably throw it away, yes.
Interviewer:
Comfortably.
Okay.
Participant 45:
I mean, shoes are an example where if they're not in very good shape any more I probably wouldn't spend a lot of money resoling or re-heeling them because I would see that there wouldn't be sufficient value or if I did then I would be stuck wearing them for a really, really long time.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So how do you determine that value though?
How much value something's worth?
Participant 45:
Shoes are a little bit easier because getting them resoled and re-heeled it has become pretty expensive but if I really, really love them, also if they fit well, I have a little bit of a trouble getting shoes to fit well.
With clothes, you repair them until ... and then I hate it if they become rags.
I don't like that at all but ... and if somebody gave it to me then it's really sad.
It seems really wrong to use something cut up as a rag.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 45:
So it's back to that respecting the thing and a thing actually is mistreated it's like it has a life, it's a living thing almost.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So hmm, how do you choose between your items, about ...
Participant 45:
That I want to keep?
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay, so if you had to choose between items, like you had to keep these and you had to get rid of some, how would you choose?
