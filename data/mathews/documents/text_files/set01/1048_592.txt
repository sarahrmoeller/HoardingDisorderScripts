Interviewee48:
Mostly just, yeah.
Personal research and directed research.
I get two or three emails about hoarding or about ADD, and hoarding was one of the issues of that, and a comorbidity of that.
Interviewer:
Right.
And what do you think-
Interviewee48:
I keep up with traumatic brain injuries, [INAUDIBLE], and concussions, dailies, certain developments and stuff.
Interviewer:
And what do you think about when you hear the words, hoarding disorder?
Interviewee48:
My first thought is the old lady that has 40 cats in her house, you know?
The lady who takes in stray cats and has 40 or 60 of them in the house.
I knew a woman who did that.
And she can't welcome anyone in.
The whole house smells like cat piss, you know?
It's just way too much, however good her intentions were, the reality that she's formed around her, is the nasty, unpleasant, dangerous form.
That's the extreme of that I think of when I hear hoarding, that's what I think of first.
I knew a woman who literally did this.
I didn't know she was doing it while she was doing it.
I know she didn't smell really good a lot of times.
I'm a cab driver, and I would pick her up and take her to work.
But then I heard that a neighbor went in or saw her or whatever, and she had dead cats.
She had, her whole entire apartment was like a, her house, rather, was like a huge kitty litter.
And she was publicly humiliated, berated, and charged with a number of different crimes, which I thought was excessive.
But, you know, Florida, what are you going to do?
Interviewer:
So when you heard hoarding disorder, what comes to mind is kind of like that woman with-
Interviewee48:
Worst case kind of thing, yeah.
Interviewer:
A hundred cats type of thing.
Interviewee48:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee48:
And from that, the next thing I think of is my mom, who has homes full of clothes that are still in the bags that she bought them in, still with the tags, and she goes shopping every week anyway.
Literally, tens of thousands of dollars worth of clothes that are stacked and stacked up, still in the bags.
Not only never been worn, never been taken out of the bags since she bought them.
Interviewer:
So the idea of excessive amounts of things, basically.
Interviewee48:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee48:
And the position on the space.
Interviewer:
So I-
Interviewee48:
If I had a four bedroom house, I wouldn't have too much stuff.
Or maybe I would, I don't know.
Interviewer:
So I remember you mentioning in the beginning about how sometimes your behavior causes you to be anxious and stressed.
Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Interviewee48:
Absolutely.
