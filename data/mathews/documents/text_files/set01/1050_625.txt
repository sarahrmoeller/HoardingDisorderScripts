Participant 50:
I really didn't.
I just got what I need, what I thought that would suffice.
And I think I've been trying to eat what I have.
I have gotten some takeout here and there and that was only because I was going Coco for Coco pops at home.
But no, not really.
I just got like I needed toilet paper, so I got toilet paper because I would have been buying toilet paper anyway.
I thought maybe more stuff to eat at home than I normally do because I hate, it's hard to cook for one person because you would eat the same thing for three years if you follow one recipe.
So I have a tendency to want to eat out and also because my kitchen is stuck, but also for, I know I'm not a good cook.
So I don't even like my cooking.
So I bought more stuff to be able to eat at home, but not an abundance where I thought well, I have all that stuff.
Interviewer:
Yeah, not more than usual.
Participant 50:
So it did not affect me that way.
Interviewer:
Great.
Well, that is all the questions.
