Interviewer:
Okay. When you're thinking about those most precious items, why are they valuable? What makes them the most valuable over everything else?
Participant 041:
Because it's how I communicate with people, and then it's part of who I am.
Interviewer:
Okay. So let's say instead of the house is on fire, let's say you lost it. What would happen?
Participant 041:
If I lost it?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 041:
Like if I lost my phone or I lost my purse, I would have to get another one, but it would be extremely stressful for the time being, but all those things can be replaced. It's hard that you lose those certain things, but they can be replaced. It's more so the body that can't be replaced, so I understand that it's a material item. Yeah, it sucks that something happened to it, but you can always get another one.
Interviewer:
So do you have any possessions that you don't think could be replaced? Like if you lost it-
Participant 041:
The more personal ones, like the stuffed animal, the family pictures. Some stuff there's only one of, so once they're gone, they're gone. Like when we moved, I didn't realize but I accidentally threw away some letters from my dad and those are gone. So it's like, "Okay, well those are gone." It's going to stick with me forever, but it is what it is. As us millennials say, it is what it is, so what else can you do?
Interviewer:
Okay, so how would you value those items compared to your purse or your phone?
Participant 041:
It's more of a sentimental value. It was sad that I lost those items, but ... I have pictures. I mean, it's okay.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 041:
I mean it's not okay, but it's like, it was my fault that I lost them. That should've been the first thing I put away, but I didn't take care of them the correct way in the first place. If I took care of them in the correct way in the first place when I was not being organized, because when I got them I wasn't being organized; I had just put them on a bookcase. I didn't put them [inaudible 00:24:28] just put letters out and they fell behind the dresser when my bookcase was moved, and then I put them somewhere. They got left behind, so that was my fault.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I know how difficult that can be, when you think back when you lost something. You're like, "Oh, if I had just done something different ..."
