Interviewer:
Have you, has your wife or kid every mentioned any, you, has it caused any sort of conflict?
Interviewee:
No, not really. Not as far as being told to get rid of things or anything like that. I haven’t experienced any of that.
Interviewer:
So what particular items do you keep? Like how do you decide if something is valuable or, or if you need to throw it away?
Interviewee:
Normally if, you know, I, I guess I used something in the past, you know. Maybe even 6 months or so and I feel like there, you know I’ll be able to use it again. Then I think I would probably hold on to that. But, yeah, I think if I, you know if I don’t use something very often or if I never use something, then I'm fine to get rid of that.
Interviewer:
Do you ever have trouble throwing something away? Does it cause any sort of anxiety? Having to discard things?
Interviewee:
Not really, I don’t know. I guess for some reason I can’t, or, I, I, I have difficulty getting rid of bags and things like that. Like backpacks, or…
Interviewer:
Okay, so can you tell me more about this?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I probably have 4 or 5 backpacks or bags or stuff like that that I rarely use, but seem to not be able to, you know, get rid of.
Interviewer:
When we were doing the free listing prompts earlier, you mentioned collections as a reason to keep things. Is there anything else, I know you mentioned that you have some backpacks, but is there anything else you like to collect or have a lot of?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I mean I guess I have some shoes, like I like to collect shoes although I don’t have a ton of them but I do have several pairs that I never wear but I still hold on to them and don’t get rid of them for one reason or another. Some of them are a little uncomfortable but so I, I, rarely ever wear them but I still have them in my closet, you know. So if there’s ever a space that seems more cluttered than others it would be the closet.
Interviewer:
Are there any other parts of your room or home, I know you said earlier that it’s not excessively cluttered, but is there anywhere else where maybe you have some things piled up that you’re not using?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I don’t, I mean like inside some of my dresser drawers there’s, or my nightstand there’s like papers in there and stuff like that that I have no idea what they are. Sorry-
Interviewer:
What, what kind of papers?
Interviewee:
I don’t know, they might be like financial statements or somewhat important documents but, that I don’t know what to do with or how to get rid of them or if I need them or anything like that.
