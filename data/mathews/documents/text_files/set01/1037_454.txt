Interviewer:
Okay, great.
So, now we're going to move on to the next section of the Interviewer which is more of a conversation.
You could just answer the questions like you would any normal conversation.
So, the first section of questions is about your behavior and treatment seeking.
Participant 37:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Could you please describe your hoarding and how long it's been going on?
Participant 37:
Okay.
I'm going to say it probably started when I was a pre-teen, maybe even younger, in my single digit years.
So my mother I would say was a hoarder, she was a child of the Depression and I remember collecting comic books and I think my mother gave me the idea that they were valuable so it was good to collect them.
So, back then I don't know how valuable they were but that became my mode of operation.
So, I would collect the comic books, I would collect the baseball cards, I would save them.
So I was saving a lot of stuff and when I got older I started buying records and I bought a lot of records and I bought more records than a human being could probably listen to or need and part of my reason was, okay I'm going to make money with this.
In some ways I did but the collecting aspect of it probably outweighed any monetary benefits so if I had not learned that collecting was a good thing I wouldn't have been in the position that I was then and still am in to some extent.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
Of wanting and sort of needing to try to get a return on my problem.
Interviewer:
Right, so it started off as a monetary thing but it just grew and grew into more of a collecting instead.
Participant 37:
Yeah, I don't know where the separation [INAUDIBLE] where I separated it but then I think money may have driven me more.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, and how severe would you say this behavior is now?
Participant 37:
I don't acquire much anymore and I am...one of the things my wife and I [INAUDIBLE] have occupied my time in the last four or five days was actually cleaning out our garage where I had so many things that I shouldn't have still had.
I filled up almost whole garbage can of mailing envelopes CROSSTALK which I saved because well, I'm going to need the mailing envelopes to mail some of the stuff I have.
I didn't need as many mailing envelopes as I had accumulated.
It was a mess and right now you can, as of today, after the Vietnam Vets pick up a lot of books and clothing, other things that I had been saving for years and years and were [INAUDIBLE].
Now you can actually walk in the garage and it's not cluttered.
Interviewer:
That's good.
