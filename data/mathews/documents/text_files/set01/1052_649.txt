Participant:
Yeah, there’s a couple of the pieces I have are somewhat financially valuable.
But um, actually the reason for keeping them is largely money that would be minted from putting it on a market is less important than the pleasure of hanging onto it.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
Okay, so, what do you think are the most important differences between what’s considered normal saving behavior, like collecting— like it sounds like you like to collect guitars and musical instruments— so, what do you think the difference is between what that is and what’s considered hoarding?
Participant:
Hmm, probably the degree.
If I’m actively using them, it seems like a worthwhile collection.
If I front them and have them in the basement and haven’t touched them for 20 years it seems like, that seems like hoarding.
Interviewer: Okay, that seems like kind of reminiscent of your own behavior.
Are there things that, you know, you haven’t touched in 20 years?
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer: Alright.
Is that the instruments, or anything else?
Participant:
It includes the instruments and equipment.
It includes things that I was sure were gonna sometime be useful around the house and haven’t been actually utilized.
Your bringing that up reminds me of the semi-successful, a purge of some items that were kept in the garage.
We had eight or 10 magnificent fixtures that I was gonna be around using for the last 25 years and I haven’t.
I finally loaded them into the van and got them off the premises.
Interviewer: Okay.
And did you feel better after you got rid of them?
Participant:
Surprisingly, yes.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, I know we’ve talked a lot about the things you keep in your home and how that relates to clutter problems, but do you think there’s a way to tell if someone has problems with clutter without being in their home?
Participant:
Is there a way?
Can you look at someone and say, “that person’s a hoarder”?
Interviewer: Right.
Like is there any tell.
Participant:
I don’t know if there’s an equivalent to gate on for hoarders.
Interviewer: You would say in general no?
Participant:
Not for sure.
My sponsor’s a 75-year old clean, and you would just look at him and say he’s another old man.
I’ve been pulled off enough by external appearances, I don’t know if I would give a lot of credence to that.
Interviewer: Okay.
Now, in that case, have you heard of any stereotypes of hoarding disorder?
Or have you seen any representations of hoarding disorder in the media that you agree with or disagree with?
Participant:
Well, at least artistic tropes.
You know, the old cat lady.
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
That’s what comes to mind.
Probably there’s a similar one of old Boomers who’ve got too many guitars around and are clueless about how it looks to the outsider.
