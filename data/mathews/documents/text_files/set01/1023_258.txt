Participant 23:
Well, I originally got it to therapy when I was 18. That was my first therapist. I've been in therapy mostly on, but with some breaks ever since. So that would be... Let see, if I started when I was 18. It was 31 years ago. So I've been in therapy on and off, mostly on ever since. How did I find that therapist? I was very depressed and anorexic in college and I believe I went to health services and they encouraged me to get a therapist. Actually, my grandfather was a doctor, a medical doctor, and I asked him for a referral to a psychiatrist. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Okay, great.
Participant 23:
So I sought counseling at college and privately to a psychiatrist. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And so you mentioned prior to that, it's difficult when or I guess I should say, you don't like it when people would want to spontaneously drop by. You don't feel prepared for that kind of thing, but how would you say your family and friends feel about your behavior and have you had any conflicts with anybody that's been close to you? 
Participant 23:
Yes. My partner, that's been an issue, about getting rid of things. That definitely is something that we address. My family of origin, my mother struggles with hoarding. Her influence is such that, if I get rid of something, she will sometimes ask me about it, ask me where it is and be upset if I've gotten rid of it. So that creates conflict for me when I'm trying to fight my tendency to keep things. 
Interviewer:
Right. Of course. I can imagine that's difficult, you trying to move forward and kind of get rid of things also because your partner has expressed that, "I don't like the clutter and everything."
Participant 23:
Exactly.
Interviewer:
But when you have your mother saying, "Hey, well, what happened to this? How could you get rid of this?" I'm sure that can be difficult. 
Participant 23:
Yes. So that creates a lot of stress being pulled in different directions. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, absolutely. So can you kind of describe your space where you live? Is it a home and how many bedrooms? Can you kind of go through the house?
