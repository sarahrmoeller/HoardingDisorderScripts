Interviewee8:
Yeah, yeah.
I feel like there must be something I'm missing here that I would really struggle to lose.
That's a really good question and that's the question I need to measure things by.
I'm sure you've heard of Marie Kondo, or whatever, and does this thing give me joy?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Interviewee8:
Right?
A friend of mine teaches that class at the college here, and I've never taken it because I just do not, I keep things that don't necessarily give me joy, and I have a reason for keeping them, like they might be useful, so I totally poo-poo that whole philosophy, but the question whether this item would cause me distress if I had to get rid of it now is interesting, because there's a whole lot of stuff here that would not cause me distress if I had to, but it makes me happy that I don't have to.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee8:
But maybe I should use that as a measure.
Like, "Why are you actually keeping this?" I can't answer that really well.
There's this interesting shaped box here that a friend gave me because she knows I like boxes.
God, like, I've got a lot of boxes.
I don't need this box.
It's not going to hurt me to get rid of it.
I'm happy I don't have to but it could go into my box of things to give away.
Does that make any sense?
Interviewer:
Yes.
So, what would happen if you lost an item that had deep sentimental meaning that is not replaceable that you don't feel okay with parting with?
Interviewee8:
What would happen?
Interviewer:
Yeah, do you-
Interviewee8:
Like, to me psychologically?
Interviewer:
However you interpret that, yeah.
Interviewee8:
Yeah, I would feel resentful that obviously someone else is making that choice for me, and understanding that there's real value to that item, and making me get rid of it.
That is not right.
Resentful.
And then it's gone, and resentment doesn't get you anywhere, I would have to work on kind of a slump, like a depression about it.
I'd have to say goodbye, and you know, it's actually bringing tears to my eyes.
Yeah, it would be really a process to get through, and I'd probably judge myself a lot about it, then I'd just like, "You've got to just work through this and have your cry and come back around and cry some more."
And I'd probably start collecting again.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Sounds like there's definitely, it seems to tie back into the feeling of control you mentioned, when we were making some lists over, like these are your items to decide about, and inviting someone else into your home or having that item taken from you is an example of that control either being taken away, or trust of another individual being diminished.
