Participant 47:
It feels so good to have more open space, that clutter gone. I sometimes worry though that I might have thrown out something I needed. But when I think about my son having to go through my old school papers, I think this is one less job he's going to have to do. So I'm kind of motivated by knowing that someone else isn't going to have to clean the stuff up. 
Interviewer:
So you would say that not wanting your son to have to deal with your collections is something that makes you know when it's time to throw something away?
Participant 47:
No. Well, now with the COVID-19, I feel like I think people are thinking about mortality more. We're all going to die, and after dealing with my mom and my dad's death, there's just so much of it, you realize you don't want to put that burden on someone else. So it doesn't give me the motivation, but that's one of my motivators is thinking that he does not have to ... It's just day to day, whether I can do it. Right now, my grandson isn't around because we're sheltering in place.
Interviewer:
Right, right.
Participant 47:
So I only have him online. When he was born, he's autistic. I've been doing a lot of his care. So I went from full-time nursing to pretty much a respite care worker for him. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 47:
So I didn't really have the time, even though I know people, if they have an hour or two, they can get stuff done. I need the time and this really good energy to start it. It's hard for me to start it, initiate it, but once I do, I can get it going. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. So just switching gears just a little bit, have you ever sought to change this behavior, like going to a professional or a counselor?
Participant 47:
I have been to counselors, but I had other problems I was dealing with, like anxiety and depression. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 47:
I actually did hire a professional organizer that was just for people who have clutter problems. She was really expensive. It was like $100 for an hour and she came into my kitchen. I still have the cabinets the way she left them. She kind of explained, "You don't need 50 of those. You live by yourself. You only need maybe five. Pick your five favorite." That was hard because of my cups. Again, each of them have special-
Interviewer:
Special memories, yeah.
