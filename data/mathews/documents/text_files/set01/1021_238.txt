I'll give you another example. I bought a box of old locks and keys, a pretty good sized box, just jam pack full of them. I went online. I did a little research, and there's clubs and there's groups that collect old locks and keys. To me, there's no value to them. I mean, they're a bunch of old keys and old locks, but I know that this club, there's somebody in there. I mean, some locks have a lot more value than others. Some of them are quite valuable if they're old enough and they're the right kind of locks, so I don't really know. I know that those locks have been sitting around here probably for three years. I really think it's trash because I don't know what to do with them unless I can find somebody in one of these groups to buy them. I should get around to taking some pictures of them and try to sell them to one of these groups.
Interviewer:
So what's stopping you from getting rid of these things? You know that someone out there would buy them, and you know that for you they have no value, so...
Participant 021:
Well, I mean, you have to sell them online or you have to find somebody interested. That's a little more difficult. You have to take pictures of them. If you really want to sell them, you sort of need to know... research them a little bit so that you can describe them accurately, and you have to sort of learn what do I have here. That's where I lose interest. It's like, okay, one day I'm going to get on online and I'm going to try to find out... There's four or five of them that I think might have more value than others, but I don't know for sure. I'd have to research them to find out, and that takes time, and so I don't put the effort into it, which I really should. Either that or I should get rid of them, but...
Interviewer:
Okay, that makes sense, so you're kind of just valuing your time more than that object?
Participant 021:
Yeah. I would like and I should, in the summertime I have a tendency to say, "Okay, well, when winter rolls around, I'll be in the house a lot more. I'm going to do... fix the clocks and I'm going to check out them locks," and then it's like, okay, I plan on doing it, but it doesn't always... I don't follow through a lot.
Interviewer:
Okay. No, that makes sense. So how do you know when you have too much stuff?
