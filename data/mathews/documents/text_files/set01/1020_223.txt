Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm .
That makes sense.
That makes sense.
Totally.
The next set of questions I had for you was about your home, but we've talked through a lot of it.
It sounds like your home right now is cluttered, but you've managed to clear some spaces in your living room in particular to host guests, but you find yourself spending less time in spaces that are less cluttered.
Does that sound right?
Interviewee:
At least so far.
Yes.
I've only just really thought of that while talking to you, because I am feeling pleased with the living room.
I'm realizing that I don't spend time there.
Interviewer:
So you like the way it looks, but it doesn't feel homey to you.
Interviewee:
Not yet.
Not yet.
I think it's going to take...
They always say it takes a while to establish a new habit, that I'm going to have to go do it for a while.
And it's-
Interviewer:
So you're not used to it.
Interviewee:
No. I'm just not used to it.
Interviewer:
When you think of the things that you save, what do you think are the most valuable things, like if somebody were to go through your stuff and say, "Okay.
We're going to throw 90% of this out, but you get to pick the stuff that we don't throw out," what would be the first set of things that you would go for to make sure it doesn't get discarded?
Interviewee:
I don't think I have anything left.
When I had to leave Berkeley, I found some lady who did garage sales and sold most of the stuff that I thought was valuable.
Then I had collected over the years some really nice semi-precious gemstone necklaces and things like that, and I gave some of those to my niece and gave away some of the others.
Then the last...
I've only got one thing left, really, that has any dollar value, a necklace that my dad gave me.
Just a few months ago, a housekeeper that I'd hired to help me vacuum stole all the rest of my jewelry, so I have almost nothing left.
