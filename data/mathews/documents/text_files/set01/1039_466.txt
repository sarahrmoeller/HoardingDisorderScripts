Interviewee:
It was a joke in the family.
None of us ever thought that this was something that you could get treatment for.
And as I say, I really do think that it's something that's inherited or really ingrained in you and I'm not at all convinced that any therapy would help.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
There is a lot of evidence that hoarding does have a genetic component so that's a good intuition that you have there, and it makes sense that you would think that given your father struggled with that as well.
There are actually, in the lab that I work in, my boss has developed an intervention specifically for hoarding and there's actually a lot of evidence that it works.
If you were ever interested, you could definitely seek it out, if you like.
Of course, you have to believe in it and all that but I'm definitely happy to hear your opinion on that.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I'm 77 now.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
At best, I probably have 20 years to live and I am thinking about getting rid of a lot of stuff.
In fact, my partner and I are both book lovers and have thousands of books.
We sell our books on Amazon and we've already sold 1,000 books, but we have several thousand to go.
At some point, these books are going to have to be gotten rid of.
Book people don't...
You can't give books to libraries, they don't want them.
No matter how priceless they are in the sense of... I have a lot of art books so my books would be, I think, very valuable to a library.
I've tried to give these books to libraries before and they don't want them.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, you save books, you save bags, you save boxes, are there anything else that you save?
Interviewee:
For a while I was really into buying shoes.
Interviewer:
Shoes, got it.
Interviewee:
I started having a love affair with shoes when I was about a sophomore or junior in high school and discovered that you didn't have to wear saddle shoes or brogans, that there were really nice stylish imported fashionable shoes so I started buying really good and unusual shoes.
Interviewer:
You started collecting that, huh?
