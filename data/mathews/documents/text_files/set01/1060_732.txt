Interviewee:
Very simple, somebody gave me something. And I know how I feel when somebody gives me something. I expect you to keep it. Its just the fact that, you know, I love you enough to do that. So that’s why I feel that I want to portray to somebody else that I really appreciate that. You get that balloon out, I wanna keep it. So, you know what I do that’s strange. Somebody will give me a balloon for mother’s day, I’ll let that thing fly until it hits the ground. It’ll be December and that thing is still flying until it hits the ground. Then I’ll cut it and I’ll hold it away.
Interviewer:
Yup.
Interviewee:
So, that’s what I do.
Interviewer:
Ok. And what is trash for you? Like what do you discard?
Interviewee:
Oh trash. Stuff that’s dirty, smelly, broken, I don’t keep nothing broken.
Interviewer:
ok. So anytime its actually considered trash you will throw it away.
Interviewee:
Yeah. I mean Yes, yeah I’m not going to keep something like that.
Interviewer:
Ok. And do you think you have too much stuff?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
How do you know that?
Interviewee:
Actually yes. I really, it’s something my daughter said “Mom, take a picture of it. Then you can have all they nice pictures and you won’t have all this stuff in your drawers.” and stuff like that. You know but I still at sometimes, I like looking at it. I don’t want to pull up a picture. Here’s another thing. I think what shocks me, in my lifetime my family has lost photos twice in our life. Once they were stolen, and once they were left behind. You can’t get pictures back from grandmothers.
Interviewer:
so you’d say that a reason why you
Interviewee:
Pictures are crap
Interviewer:
Keep your things so much is that you don’t; you can’t rely on photos.
Interviewee:
You know what else I hoard. Now that you make me; files on my computer. You know I don’t just have a pile of pictures. I’ll take my pictures and I’ll put them in a file. I put them on a cd and I put them on a thumb drive. Believe it or not in three places.
Interviewer:
Hmm. Just because you…
Interviewee:
So that’s
Interviewer:
Can’t trust physical photos.
Interviewee:
Yup. That was a [UNCLEAR] . That’s a trigger. I don’t want to lose my pictures again.
Interviewer:
Right. Ok. If you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Interviewee:
Oh man now you got me upset. That triggers
Interviewer:
I’m sorry. Would you like to skip that question?
Interviewee:
that was unnecessary. Why did it do that? Why did that question do that? I don’t like to be… I’m okay, I’m okay.
Interviewer:
We can skip it.
