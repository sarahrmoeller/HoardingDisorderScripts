Interviewee:
Yeah. Well, it's funny.
The brother I have, who's a much worse hoarder, he got very ill last year and was actually hospitalized for a while, and they were telling us that he couldn't go back home unless the emergency people could get into his home with a stretcher.
It was very clear to the whole family that he couldn't, so we'd all been worried about him for years, so we moved everything that he had, except the basic furniture, into a storage, and he had been giving lip service to saying, "I want to get rid of stuff, too," but as soon as he got home, he took it all back in.
It made me realize how deeply that impulse goes, because he knows very well that nobody wants to come visit him with his house the way it is.
I don't know that he's been able to let himself consciously see that he uses it as a way to keep people away, I think.
It may be the fear or other components are a bigger part of it.
I don't know.
But anyway, it really taught me something watching, because we made his place be really nice and really welcoming, and just, boom, he had it back.
Interviewer:
It made you realize, it sounds like, how much he can't help it-
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
... and how much he's unaware.
Interviewee:
And absolutely how out of control it is for him.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm .
Also, sounds like-
Interviewee:
CROSSTALK too.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
But also, I don't want to do that.
I don't want to leave my family to be having to clear up after me when I go.
I mean, I'm in my 70s.
I don't want to leave that burden to them.
Interviewer:
So it made you more self-reflective about-
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
... about how you want to kind of get control over this, even though it's difficult to control.
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
Definitely.
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
I can understand that.
It also sounds like it made you realize how little he's able to see why he's doing it.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
That kind of made you feel more... kind of value your own self-reflection more.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it did.
It did.
Interviewer:
Well, I don't want to... I want to continue this conversation.
I have more questions, but first-
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
... let's finish our lists.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Okay.
Interviewer:
Before we got distracted by this, we were making a list of ways that a person could identify someone with hoarding, and we talked about how you would look at their space and be able to tell.
Do you feel like there's other ways that you could identify someone with hoarding if you met them?
Interviewee:
Maybe not just at first meeting, but I've seen my brother look through scrap piles and pick up something, a piece of an old telephone or something like that.
So it's-
Interviewer:
So if you watched them...
Yeah.
Interviewee:
If you watch somebody dealing with giveaways or trash or flea markets, where I'm sure you get a lot of that in people who go to flea markets.
