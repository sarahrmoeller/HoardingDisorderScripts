And, I did clean out a drawer. In spite of all this, I'm trying to declutter. Based on my age, I'm thinking, "I need to be decluttering." Well sometimes, some of those things that I've taken out of the drawer to clean it out, end up on the top of the countertop, because I'm not sure where I want to put those immediately. But, I do want the drawer to be empty, so I can use it for another purpose. 
But I can walk through it without tripping. That's really important to me at my age. I have one of the boxes, is a burn box. So stuff that needs to be shredded or burned. I put in there. And I have another one that's stuff that I can take to my recycle bin. So those are on the floor, and I paint, I'm an artist for a hobby. So there's also a box of canvases on the floor, and some baskets that have magazines, papers, art supplies. You can see why I don't want anyone coming in here. 
Interviewer:
Is this just your-
Participant 29:
Then I have my computer ... Go ahead, sorry.
Interviewer:
No, you're okay. Is this just your office space?
Participant 29:
This is just my office space. Yeah ... I have my computer and way too many cords because I have all sorts of devices hooked up. I have a lot of notebooks for my volunteer, I actually need them. And it's actually being quite organized to have them, but just because I keep each case in a particular, in an individual notebook. I'm a guardian at [inaudible 00:24:49], I don't know if you know what that is?
Interviewer:
Yes. I love to hear that. Thank you so much.
Participant 29:
Oh, you're welcome. So for each case, I have notebooks. And I have training materials, notebook, so it's a lot of papers, highlighters, little sticky tabs. So yeah, so that's it. It's you know, magnifying glass ... There's also a nail file here, and reading glasses, little extraneous. Lots of little notepads, so when you wanted to give me a telephone number, I have something to write on and pens. But I do have a pen drawer that every now and then I collect up the pens, put them all back in the drawer and start over. 
Interviewer:
They have their place.
Participant 29:
And the rest of the house, you would come in and like I said, it just looks like a normal house, couch and chairs, and television. Everything is all in place. I would say that my greatest failing in that part of the house is the kitchen right now, because I live alone, nobody has come in here for four months. So I will leave some dishes in the sink sometimes now, whereas I didn't use to do that. But I mean, not piles of them, one or two days at the most.
