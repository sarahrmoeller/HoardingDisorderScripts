Interviewer:
All right.
So I think that segues perfectly into the next section which is going to be really talking about value.
So when you think about your possessions what really makes them valuable and how do you determine if they're valuable or not?
Participant 45:
Well, I've probably done too much of that.
I think it's all valuable but I'm trying to learn about that.
I mean there are certain books I like better than other ones.
Most people say once they've read a book they would get rid of it but I love to return to them.
I love to return to what I've underlined and go back to it.
So unfortunately I don't get rid of books and that's a huge problem.
Books are big problem.
Then my mother left, my parents, but unbelievable boxes of photographs and then other people just dumped off boxes of photographs that maybe I'm in some of them but I have been a bit of a dumping zone for people.
I also had a business partner that dumped things on me.
He left three storage lockers and I just took forever to get rid of that.
I finally did.
The whole business offices I had to clear out and it took me years to do.
I mean, it's just ...
Interviewer:
So when you were saying you cleared those out, how did you decide what was trash, what to actually get rid of?
Participant 45:
In those storage lockers that weren't my things?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 45:
Or in my own?
Interviewer:
Oh, honestly both.
I'm curious about both, [INAUDIBLE]-
Participant 45:
Well, it's a lot of paper usually.
Papers are problems.
And if it's repeated and repeated and repeated you can only keep one set right, and get rid of all the duplicates, multiple.
There are a lot of duplicates of things in my life.
Old saved junk mail surely can be thrown out and then my OCDs a problem.
I'll take the glue off of these things before I recycle them so the glue doesn't get into recycling or make sure that there isn't a credit card or some kind of plastic card that needs to come out so it can go into the paper recycling.
The agony I go through with recycling has only recently mitigated because where I live accepts very little recycling now because there's no longer much of a market for most things and if they can't sustainably recycle effectively they won't accept it so far more things go into the black bin, or the throwaway garbage, landfill, if you will CROSSTALK
Interviewer:
Okay, so what I'm understanding is when you have multiples of things it's easier for you to get rid of something, right?
Participant 45:
If they're identical, usually, now that might not be true with clothes because I always try to use up things.
Interviewer:
Okay, well-
