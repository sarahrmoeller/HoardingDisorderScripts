Saw the waffle maker sitting there, and I'm going, okay, I've got a empty trash, take my trash bag out. I'm going to take that waffle maker and when I take the trash out, I'm going to put the waffle maker out on the garage sale shelf. Great, it's done. It's gone. You don't really notice, oh, this is space reclaimed, because there's still so much crap there. 
It's almost like I have to sneak up on it, and not, okay, this is what I'm going to do right here.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you don't have problems making the decision that you don't need something anymore, it's everything that comes after that, that's the problem. 
Participant 035:
Yeah. Basically, that's it. 
Interviewer:
When you think about your home, what would you say are the most important or valuable to you items in your home? Again, this doesn't mean necessarily monetarily valuable, but when you think about all of the different things that you have, which things are most important to you? What is the most, I hate to even put this in people's head, but if you were in danger of losing your stuff, what would be the stuff that you'd go for first, that you would say, this is the thing I need to save?
Participant 035:
My computer. Yeah. The computer, for sure. 
Interviewer:
How come your computer, because you use it so often?
Participant 035:
Yeah. It's my lifeline. It's the way I communicate. It's a time suck. I have all my valuable papers and documents. Not all, but I've got my life on it. Online registration forms, software licenses, tax records, all that sort of thing. It's all there.
Interviewer:
Okay. Any other items that you go to in your mind as, that's a thing I would really miss if I lost it?
Participant 035:
Jewelry. It's not all jewelry, it's just things that are special to me, like maybe jewelry that I have made. Special pieces that represent, for example, when I traveled all the time, I would build up the American Express points, and had always admired one particular jewelry, LAGOS Jewelry. I would use my points to buy pieces. That's valuable to me. It's also things that I can pass down. 
Interviewer:
Your granddaughter. 
Participant 035:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Has your problems with clutter ever gotten in the way of your important relationships? Do you feel like this is upsetting for people around you?
Participant 035:
Yeah. I'm sure that it is, but we don't talk about it.
Interviewer:
You don't talk about it with your son?
Participant 035:
No. Because he and my daughter-in-law have a lot of stuff around. But, my daughter-in-law helps keep it under control. 
Interviewer:
He also saves a lot. 
Participant 035:
They've got a tighter space, but Tara helps Jeff keep the clutter down. 
Interviewer:
He also can be very cluttered, but she's got her to help her with that. 
Participant 035:
Right.
