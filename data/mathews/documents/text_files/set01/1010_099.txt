Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Okay. Yeah. How do your family and friends feel about your cluttering?
Interviewee:
I think they understand that I don't invite people in because I don't particularly want them to see my house.
I've got a tiny little condo, way too much stuff in it, as most people would in a one bedroom condo.
I've got a sick cat and I've got COPD.
I'm not well myself, so I'm not in good enough shape really to clean.
When I have the money, I get a maid in here and I clean it up, and it stays okay for about a week and then it gets about where it was again.
Interviewer:
Okay.
All right.
Have you ever had any problems with family, friends, or people close to you or even landlords about your cluttering?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Please describe where you live now.
Do you live alone?
What's the space like?
Interviewee:
I'm alone in a one bedroom condo.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Does this home look like the way that you want it to?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay, what would you want to change?
Interviewee:
Well, there's too much stuff, but the problem is I need the stuff that I have.
I just got a tiny little place.
I work from home, and I work with computers, so I've got a lot computer stuff.
Too much paper.
I don't know that you'd call that hoarding, I'm just too lazy to go through it and throw it away.
It's not that I want to keep it, but I got way too much paper and bills to throw away and I smoke, so there's nicotine on the walls and stuff.
I wish that was not so, but it is.
Basically, I'm just lazy.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
A lot of clutter.
How important is your clutter for you to feel at home?
If you were to throw them away, do you think you would feel less at home?
Interviewee:
No. If I could go through all this junk, throw out what needs to be thrown out, I'd be very happy.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you have certain objects that are more important to you than others?
Interviewee:
Probably my bills, and they need to be gone through, by the date and stuff.
I was, well, I'm actually self employed, so there's a certain amount of that stuff I have to keep and being in a one bedroom apartment there's not much of a place to keep boxes full of bills.
And I have a lot of movies.
I don't really want to get rid of them and I've got right many in these CDs, which are all in shelves.
I would want to keep the CDs.
There is a lot of piles of that stuff that needs to be gone through and thrown out.
That would be it.
