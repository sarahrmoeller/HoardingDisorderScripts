Interviewer:
Okay, so as you know this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to problems with clutter. Before we start, I would like to ask, when we are talking about your personal difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding items, is there a specific term that you would like to use? 
Participant 46:
No. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So the first section, thank you for answering all of those questions. The first section that we're going to discuss is all about behavior and treatment-seeking. So can you please describe your problems with hoarding disorder? For me... 
Participant 46:
What do you mean, my problems with hoarding disorder? How I think I'm a hoarder?
Interviewer:
So how long you've been dealing with these clutter issues, how they impact your behavior, do you see your behavior as a problem? Is it severe?
Participant 46:
Okay, so it started at seven years old. Well, we moved, I'd say 75 times-
Interviewer:
Oh, wow.
Participant 46:
... before I was seven years old. Yes. There was a lot of issues there. I don't think we stayed in one place... When I was seven years old my dad came back into our lives, and he bought a house, and so things were okay but I was a mini-hoarder. So I just hoarded my desk. And my dad married another woman, and here started the anti-hoarding. She started throwing things out, which started making me hoard more. Then by just sheer transition. I left home very early, and by sheer transition, meaning I couldn't carry a lot on my back, or carry a lot in my own personal moving. But once I settled down I started to collect. In fact, I even bought a bigger house to collect more. It did effect my relationships. I was with a person for many years, and we had many screaming arguments over the saving of many useless things.

Interviewer:
Did any of... Oh, sorry. 
Participant 46:
Go ahead.
Interviewer:
Did any other friends or family members feel or say a certain thing about this behavior? Or landlord? 
Participant 46:
Yes. Family members... Now at one point I was good at hiding it, so I bought a house that was upstairs/downstairs, and I hoarded everything downstairs so that if I invited a family member upstairs, they would never know about downstairs. But one time something went wrong with downstairs, so I got my older brother to come over, and he was very surprised, because he's an electrician, so... And then finally in these last, what I would say, 10 years, my contractor told me this last time, "Listen, you've got to get rid of some of your stuff for me to work on this area. I can't work around this anymore."
