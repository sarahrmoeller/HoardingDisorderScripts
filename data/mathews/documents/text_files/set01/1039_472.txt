Participant 039:
Yeah. So I started hoarding needles.
Every time, eventually we'd run out of needles so the next time we went to the store and we had to drive 100 miles to go to a store, she'd buy a pack of needles.
Well, guess who got those pack of needles?
I did.
I went into the grocery packs and I took those kinds of things, needles and scissors and thread and I found an old dresser kind of like a...
Actually what it was, was an old record cabinet where people used to keep the 78's, records.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 039:
I turned that into my drawer, my dresser and no one, I got my mother to agree and tell my sisters that they were to never to go into my drawer.
CROSSTALK
Interviewer:
Got it.
That's when you started saving all that stuff.
Got it.
Wow.
That's pretty crazy.
Okay.
Well, that's interesting too, what you were saying earlier about telling between clutter and actual hoarding, seems like you had some good insight to being that old and noticing you were doing that.
When you think about it now, what are some important differences between normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding, do you think?
Participant 039:
Normal saving behavior and hoarding?
Interviewer:
Yes.
What's the difference?
You were saying there's a clutter problem and then there's hoarding or people collect and then there's hoarding.
What differentiates that in your mind?
Participant 039:
Well, I make a difference between the two in that hoarding is something that you save the same kind of thing or even the same thing.
It's something in multiples.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 039:
Whereas, boxes for instance, and I always go back to boxes because, of course, there is kind of an anteroom before you get into the basement in this house and that room is nearly ceiling to floor in boxes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 039:
You can still get down the stairs and go into the part of the basement where the washing machine is and the water heater and the fuel tank and so forth, but most of it is taken up by bookcases, a big bookcase as well as just stacks of boxes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 039:
It's the hoarding of something that's pretty much the same, whereas clutter can be a number of things piled in a pile or thrown in a corner or thrown in a box, shoved under your bed, that's clutter.
Interviewer:
Got it.
The difference is besides just having a pile of something, it's a lot more things in a lot more places, right?
Participant 039:
Yeah.
