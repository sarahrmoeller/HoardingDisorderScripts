Interviewer:
Does your daughter and son-in-law help you to keep your room from being cluttered or do they mostly just leave your space to be your space?
Interviewee:
They leave my space to be my space.
The only thing they really do in here is ...
They don't do it themselves, but they did do it, but they have a cleaning lady who comes in once a week to clean the house, and she comes through too.
She like to reorganize things for me very articulate.
That's surprising.
I took my space, I close the door, I don't see any intention to it.
We're both happy that way.
Interviewer:
So when you think about your space now and the stuff that you have in it, what is the most valuable?
What is the stuff that you save now that you value the most?
Interviewee:
Oh, gosh... I don't remember writing an answer on the top of my head.
I haven't really thought about that so much, but if I got forced to ...
Gosh.
I purge stuff once in a while out of necessity and I'd say the most valuable stuff I have in here might be things liker my birth certificate, and my social security card.
Interviewer:
It doesn't have to be valuable monetarily.
It could also be valuable just to you.
So maybe one way of thinking about this is if I were to say, "Show me the thing that is the most meaningful for you."
What items in your room would you show me?
Interviewee:
I'd have to look hard to find it but I have pictures of children, and my wife as my since she [INAUDIBLE].
Those are probably the most valuable to me because it's unlocking a bunch of memories.
Interviewer:
So yo would most value the items that are attached to the memories of your family?
Interviewee:
Yes, ma'am.
Interviewer:
And when you go through your stuff to decide what you've just old me, sometimes you have to purge stuff.
How do you decide when it's time to do that and what stiff is okay to purge?
Interviewee:
Sorry.
I really don't think I may have much use for it and maybe somebody could do well with and somebody could take it down to give Goodwill and give to them or Angels ATTIC.
There's various charities around.
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
So is it-
Interviewee:
One thing I did do though, ma'am I haven't told you about [INAUDIBLE] serious weight problem.
I was 320 pounds and managed to get down to 185.
Interviewer:
Wow, good for you.
That is not easy.
Interviewee:
Well, then i just ballooned back up to 230.
So weighed this morning, now it's 209.
So I am working at it,
Interviewer:
Good for you.
