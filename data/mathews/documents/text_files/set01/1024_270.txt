Interviewer:
The first thing I'd like to ask you is just how you talk about your own problems with clutter.
Would you say that you're a person who has problems with clutter?
Would you say that you're a person who has problems with hoarding disorder?
Participant 24:
I would say a big problem with clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So you have a clutter problem.
Participant 24:
I have a what?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Okay.
Well, that's all the lists that I had for you today.
Now I'd like to move into the part of the interview where we just talk a little bit more naturally.
Just to start.
I would love for you to tell me about your clutter problems.
When they began and what it's like for you now.
Participant 24:
Well, I don't know when it began.
When it began...
Oh, I'm thinking back to when I was a child.
Of course, my mother would get rid of things.
Hmm.
Let me think.
That I have to think.
It probably began when I bought my first house, because then I had space and to keep things.
So that would have been, do you want my ages or what do you want?
Interviewer:
No, you can tell me this story however it makes sense to you.
So if you remember how old you were or you can approximate, it's totally fine.
Participant 24:
Well, I'm thinking probably in my mid twenties or, yeah, mid to late twenties.
That's when it started because I had more room to keep things and I was out working.
So I had my own money to buy things.
And then my husband passed, then I was married and my husband passed away and he brought all the stuff that he had, which was good stuff because he always have an antique store.
And so I had to put up with that, which filled up my garage.
Our garage at that time, but it's a state and then my mother passed away and I got all of her things.
So in the meantime I was doing my own collecting of items.
So it started back in mid to late twenties and then just kind of gradually grew.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So it sounds like in your mid twenties, was there a little bit?
But over time you've kind of accumulated more and more stuff from the various people in your life.
Participant 24:
That's right.
Plus what I was accumulating myself, like books and records and things like that.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 24:
And antiques too.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 24:
Et cetera, et cetera.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So it sounds like you always had the tendency to keep things because you had so many interests.
Participant 24:
That's right.
