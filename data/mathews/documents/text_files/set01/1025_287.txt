Participant 25:
It's overwhelming.
I've been thinking a lot lately, because I don't have any children, my husband does, and my mother's passed away and my dad is remarried so he's on a different side of the family.
My only blood sibling died also, so I'm sort of like the orphan on my mom's side of the family, because my brother's gone and my mom's gone, and I have no children.
I have nieces and nephews.
I've just been thinking a lot lately, well I either need to give these photos to my nieces and nephews or I just need to discard them because when I'm gone nobody's going to want them.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 25:
I have been thinking along those lines.
I mean the chances of me throwing them away are pretty slim right now, but my nieces and nephews are still pretty young, they're like young adults, or at least coming into young adulthood.
I have to wait until the right time to give them this stuff, and they may not even want it.
A lot of the younger generations, they don't hold onto stuff like previous generations did.
Interviewer:
Well I remember my grandmother, whenever she passed away she had a lot of photos and family heirlooms and collector's items and we kept a fair amount of them, but we did make the effort to go through the photographs and discarded the ones that we couldn't discern the meaning of.
That was-
Participant 25:
CROSSTALK yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah and that was kind of a nice way to go through them.
My parents, ended up inspiring them to go through their photos with my sister and I and if there was a photograph that didn't have a ton of meaning to them and it had no meaning to us they're like, "Well we'll probably throw it away anyways later."
It's interesting how so much value is dependent on who has the item.
Participant 25:
Yep, yep.
Interviewer:
Do you have any items, or any one item that you consider to be most precious to you?
Participant 25:
One item.
Not really.
Interviewer:
Is there any group of items?
Participant 25:
Well I have some of my mother's jewelry, so that would be precious.
I've got my dad's fire department badge, so I've got some jewelry type things that would be keepsakes.
My mother had a lot of jewelry too.
My mother, I get a lot of my tendencies from my mother, so she had a lot of stuff.
Other than that I can't think of anything that would be ... I have a TREDDLE sewing machine that belonged to my grandmother, and that's something that's very valuable.
Well it's valuable to me because it's sentimental.
Interviewer:
What do you feel then, when you think about possibly losing that item?
