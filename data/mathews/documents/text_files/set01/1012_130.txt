Interviewee:
Which objects are most important for you? Which ones do you spend most of your time with?
Participant 012:
I don't spend any time with any of them other than looking at them. Well, books, I guess would be ... I don't know. I don't spend any particular time on any one thing because I flip from thing to thing to thing because constantly changing my attention. Well, I mean, I'm just now stopping work so that takes up most of your day. You know? I guess I spend most of my time on the computer at this point and just enjoying the stuff but I don't spend any time on it. I guess gardening but that's a whole different subject.
Interviewee:
Okay. You'd say you spend most of your free time gardening and then on the computer?
Participant 012:
Well, it's also that it has to get done too. Free time, at this point, yeah, it's actually on the computer. 
Interviewee:
Okay. When you think about your possessions, what makes them available? How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
Participant 012:
If it fits the collection or if it was given by somebody, it has sentimental value, I guess really. Other than the books that were fun to read. It depends on the item. Mostly sentiment or if it's an area that I have enjoyed or have interest in makes it valuable.
Interviewee:
It's more like your own personal value to it?
Participant 012:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.
Interviewee:
Then what do you consider trash or what do you discard?
Participant 012:
What's discard? Yeah. Well, I guess if it doesn't really ... If somebody gives me something that doesn't really fit, it takes a long time for me to get rid of it because somebody has given it to me but eventually if it finally is not in good condition or doesn't fit whatever collection or whatever, I can get rid of it. If it's papers and has no value, not needed anymore, I can get rid of those. Yeah. I guess it's condition and whether or not it fits.
Interviewee:
When you say when it fits your collection, what kind of collections do you have? What's an item that wouldn't fit in your collection that you'd feel okay getting rid of?
Participant 012:
Well, okay. One of the collections are nesting dolls. If somebody gives me a set of nesting dolls that I don't really care for, I will get rid of it after a period of time. Right now, there's very little room anyway so it's kind of ... I don't go out and buy them anymore. I don't go ... Unless they're really, really special ones. Yeah. For instance, I don't care for Santa Claus. My son gave me a Santa Claus set. Well, took about 10 years but I got rid of one set and have another one I'll get rid of eventually. I don't want to hurt his feelings either but that kind of thing.
