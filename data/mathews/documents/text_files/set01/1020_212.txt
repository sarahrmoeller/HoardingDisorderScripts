Interviewer:
So you kind of saw in yourself that same impulse, not just to do the kind of...
Just to take a step back, it sounds like there's almost two things that you recognize happening.
One is this kind of more conscious process of you saying, "Oh, I could use it.
I want to keep it.
It's interesting," and then it also sounds like you're recognizing or you recognized in that moment maybe a more unconscious process-
Participant 020:
Right.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
... which is about kind of creating a space that feels safe to you out of your items.
Participant 020:
Right.
Then the other thing that helped was that I'm a recovering alcoholic, and I've been sober for a very long time.
I've done a lot of other programs, one of which I went to... it's called Bettors Anonymous... and they had a spinoff over the years of something called Hoarders Anonymous.
That was one of the subjects that people dealt with was why do you buy things?
Why do you spend money you don't have?
What is the impulse?
I had finally concluded, and I imagine there are other writers who have, too, that the combination of the advertising we're exposed to and things like that, the tons... the huge availability of choices that we have that people didn't used to have, that there's this constant sense inside that I'll be a better person, a prettier person, a more interesting person, something like that, if I have these things.
That's as much of an addiction as anything else, I think.
It was the recognition of that addictive quality to my wanting things that I thought were absolutely gorgeous but that I'd never be able to use that finally put the brake on my buying things that were more than I could really afford.
Interviewer:
So it's-
Participant 020:
And I think-
Interviewer:
Go ahead.
Participant 020:
Yeah.
The addictive quality of it was really important.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you used to do more purchasing behavior before you had the realization that-
Participant 020:
Right.
Interviewer:
... and I'm going to try to say this realization back to you... that you were purchasing because you felt that there were qualities of the things that you were purchasing which would kind of make you more... you would be more associated with their attractiveness.
Does that sound right?
Participant 020:
I think it was more that I was drawn to the aesthetics of it, and what I wasn't aware of at that time was the psychological impact of advertising and stuff like that on people.
It's not just me.
I think an awful lot of people buy way more than they need to buy.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 020:
But other people are more able to get rid of things when they get something new.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
