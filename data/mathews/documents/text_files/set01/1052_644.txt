Interviewee:
Our visit was brief.
Um, I was not entirely ready to address the project, and so I stepped away from it.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
Okay, so, now I’m going to talk a little bit about any conflict you might have had with family members, or friends, or landlords.
Has there ever been any conflict in your life that kind of resulted because of your problems with clutter?
Interviewee:
One with the landlord, yes.
Interviewer: Okay, can you tell me about that?
Interviewee:
The place I’m in right now was being renovated and I was given the opportunity to move space.
Well, the work was done in this space.
And, I, uh, I didn’t move all of my materials out of this space and it was brought to my attention by the building manager.
Interviewer: Okay.
And, how was that brought to your attention?
Interviewee:
If the things are here another day it’s gonna be gone.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
Okay, so, other than the landlord, have you ever had any conflicts with your family members about it?
Interviewee:
A loving niece kindly brought it to my attention that she’s noticed that our residence has uh, has a jumbled appearance.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
Interviewee:
And, would I like any help?
Interviewer: Okay, so she’s personally offered you help with that then.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Alright, and I noticed you said “our” space.
Do you live alone, or do you live with somebody else?
Interviewee:
I have a wife of about 30 years of marriage and 39 years of together.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, has your wife ever taken issue with your problems with your problems with clutter?
Interviewee:
Um, we have, uh… a similar, a similar challenge with, um, storing and not disposing.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
So, between you and your wife, would you say that your problems are worse, or are they slightly better?
Interviewee:
That may be a matter of perspective.
I am one who is, um, attempting to take some steps on it.
My wife may be attempting to make attempting to make steps on it, but she is not getting any help.
Interviewer: Right.
Okay, so, if you could describe your home for me.
What does your home look like?
Interviewee:
Like a huge jumble.
Interviewer: Okay.
Can you emphasize a little bit?
Interviewee:
We live in an area that is um, was at one point in the city’s history past the city’s limits.
So, it’s not an entirely urban area.
The external area is delightfully wild.
We have racoons, moles, lots of birds, beavers.
All manner of wildlife outside in a rather wild-looking yard space.
Interviewer: Okay, and how does the clutter look like in the home?
Interviewee:
In the home, it’s apparent at the entryway, where there are more jackets than we can wear.
Interviewer: Okay, and are they hung up on the walls, or in piles?
