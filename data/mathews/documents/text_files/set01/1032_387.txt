Participant 32:
Hmm, well I guess I don't necessarily think of the books being valuable in a monetary sense, they're certainly valuable in a family sense. But I don't think of them as particularly valuable objects. And I do... Okay, there is some similarity in that John Doe in the last one, is that I do enjoy... I do like antiques. I do appreciate them and I do have... Oh, maybe three or four antiques, wooden antique pieces in my own house. In fact, I just bought one a couple of days ago. It's a bookshelf for my family books. But now I might be giving away a lot of my family books, I won't need to use my bookshelf. But anyway, yeah. So yeah, I understand that. But okay, but let me say again. The antiques that I have, I do not consider to be of a particular value. Like again, monetary value. 
Interviewer:
Like monetary, mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Participant 32:
It's not something I think, "Oh, I'm worried about not having that because it's worth so much money." Uh-uh, no. 
Interviewer:
Okay, gotcha. So, that's more about the books for you are more of the attachment rather than the financial gain. 
Participant 32:
Oh yeah, absolutely. Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay, and now we're moving onto our very last section, which is about COVID coping. I know that you said that it didn't impact you very much but we'll just go ahead and go through some of these. 
Participant 32:
Sure. 
Interviewer:
So, how has COVID-19 impacted your life at all? 
Participant 32:
Well, it has decreased the amount of social life I have. So yeah, although I do tend to love to stay home and be home by myself most of the time, there were things that I would do that I miss doing that were social that are not happening, they've gone virtual or gone to Zoom or whatever like that. And that is not in any way, as satisfying as being together with a group of people. So, that did impact. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so your socialization behaviors have changed. Has COVID-19 affected your acquiring habits? Have you been buying more, buying less? Saving more, saving less? 
Participant 32:
Huh... No, I think... Although, I told you I just did buy a bookshelf yesterday. That was more because I needed a bookshelf and it's not an excessive thing. It's an object I can really use. So, I don't think that it has affected my buying and selling. I'm pretty much the same in that regard. 
Interviewer:
Okay, has it affected your difficulties with throwing things away? 
Participant 32:
No. No, it's... Yeah, but no. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And has COVID-19 affected your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items? Do you feel more attached or less attached? 
Participant 32:
Huh... I suppose I could feel just ever so slightly, only very slightly, more attached but really not much. 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Why would you say more attached?
