Participant:
That, you know, that everything would be organized.
Um, that— and I'm trying.
I honestly, I’ve tried, and I've tried, and tried.
And I'll spend the whole weekend and I’ll clean out a closet, and a year later that closet doesn't look like it's ever been touched.
I have a craft room.
I had, you know, I throw everything in big totes.
And then, one by one, I started emptying the totes so that I can organize the room.
And I still— it's more organized than it was before, but I'm still having trouble making the space cleaned up.
And I just have a tendency to have too much stuff.
I don't need this stuff, but at the same time, it's not things that I'm willing to just throw away.
That's, that's just a different problem.
You know, and I, I clean up, and I put all the stuff, you know, I throw away big bags of trash, and I put together big boxes for the Goodwill.
But there just always seems to be more.
Interviewer : Right.
Participant:
And, part of the problem that I have with, with cleaning up the clutter, is that when you start to do that, it’s always worse before it gets better.
So, for example, if I want to clean out a closet, the only way to do that is to pull everything out of the closet.
And then start, you know, going through it, and putting it in the piles, and what to keep and what to throw out and what to give away.
And then start to put it back in the closet.
And, you know, a matter of time and space to do that is really difficult.
I mean, to be able to do that even in my own bedroom, means that I may not be able to sleep on the bed by the time I pull all the stuff out.
It's going to take me more than a day.
Interviewer : Right.
Does it usually take you more than a day, or like that same amount of time every time you've tried to clean up a certain area?
