Participant 23:
I think there was a time when my partner wanted to host somebody and it was just... We both recognize we couldn't... Let's say, it would have to be that weekend and it was a Wednesday and we wouldn't have time with working to clean up the house. So there was tension over it. We would want to be able to host but we couldn't see a way to do it and feel comfortable because we're not comfortable just saying like, "Yeah, sorry our house is a mess. Hey, come on over." So we didn't go ahead and do it and so it caused conflict and it caused personal distress for me. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. I totally see why. So I think that really covers everything for the free response section. So I'm just going to go ahead and ask you a couple of demographic questions. If you're uncomfortable answering any of them, no problem at all.
