Interviewer:
Okay. Are there parts of your home that don't have any clutter?
That maybe you keep a bit cleaner than other aspects or other parts of your home?
Participant 30:
They all have a certain amount of clutter.
Interviewer:
In the rooms with the clutter, is there any sorts of organization or do you just kind of stack things and...
Is there any sorts of way that you organize them?
Participant 30:
The magazines are kind of stacked on one little shelf, big shelf actually, and the papers are mostly on the dining room table, and I do have, I have books and I have... I have like three bookcases, but they seem to always be overflowing.
Yeah.
I guess I kind of, they're kind of clustered in piles that make sense.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So there is a level of organization then within the things that you collect?
Participant 30:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Now I want to talk a little bit about what you would ideally like your home to look like.
Participant 30:
Well, I would like to be able to use the tables for tables, and not for, yeah, I think I would like it to look a little less full.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So ideally, you would like it to be a bit neater and have kind of less stuff?
Participant 30:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
When you think about your possessions, what do you think makes them valuable enough to keep around, and how do you determine whether something has value or if it doesn't?
Participant 30:
I think it's, a couple of years ago my mother had downsized, moved from a large house to a smaller house, and she got rid of everything.
Any kind of family things, she didn't keep.
She doesn't have an attachment to things so she told me whatever I wanted, I better take it so I have several boxes, that I've had for a year or two, and I haven't even opened them.
I think a lot of it is family things, especially things that remind me of visiting my great aunts, and some of them have some value in themselves.
Like one thing I have, I have an original Charles Schultz' drawing, but a lot of it is not really of any value to anybody else, but it just sort of, because I attach memories to things, I think it's hard to let them go.
Interviewer:
So for you, sentimentality is a big aspect of it?
Participant 30:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I know you said you had some maybe monetarily valuable things, but it kind of sounds like that's less important to you than if something has sort of family attachments to it?
Participant 30:
Right.
