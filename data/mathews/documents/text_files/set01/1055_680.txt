Interviewee:
Well, we don’t let very many people come over. Uh, it’s just rare. Um…
Interviewer: Okay, so, is there, you know, any sort of like fights that you've had about it or, or what does your husband say about it?
Interviewee:
Well, he, he gets mad about it because he’s embarrassed. He wants to be able to have people come over, and friends come over, and, you know he can’t do that because he’s embarrassed.
Interviewer: Mhmm. So, was there ever a time where you were able to have more friends over, and now, like, that's less of an option for you? Or was it always kind of like this?
Interviewee:
It’s always been like this.
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee:
And he’s always been mad about this. But, I always feel like I’m doing the best I can. I can’t do anything different.
Interviewer: Mhmm. So, obviously there's some conflict between you and your husband about it. But, how about any of your friends? How do they feel about that?
Interviewee:
Well, I mean I don’t say anything. Uh… You know, their idea is just throw it away, where for everyone, you know, it’s just not that easy to do.
Interviewer: Right. Yeah, I can understand it's very difficult in this case, and oftentimes people will have a hard time understanding that. So, how about your parents, or maybe some siblings, if you have any?
Interviewee:
I don't have any siblings, but my mother is a hoarder. So, um… and, at the moment I am staying with her and working out of her house. And, it is going very [inaudible; ] since this is something that has to be done. Because, you know, she’s 83 and it’s just a matter of time with her health. So, I’m needing to get her health cleaned up.
Interviewer: So, how are you finding that process? Is it easier for you to clear out your mother's house than, you know, clearing out your own possessions?
Interviewee:
Yes, it is. It's just, I'm just very slow. I always think that, you know, I want to be careful about throwing things away, I don’t want to throw anything away that’s valuable or, you know, important, or I need. But, you know, now I'm in a situation where this is a have to.
Interviewer: Right. So, it has made it a bit easier now that it's kind of an essential thing you need to do?
Interviewee:
A little, a little.
