Participant:
Well there’s the television, and there’s more just the general culture I think , than any kind of scientific journal.
I’ve read book on organization by trying to fix it by, you know, developing a technique or something before I realized that it was not...
It was deeper than having lack of knowledge.
So, you know, I would read books about how to organize this or that.
Interviewer:
Okay, that’s interesting, and what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Participant:
Well I’ve had a tenant once who was definitely a hoarder, and we had to evict her from the rental property because of her behavior, so I think about that.
Interviewer:
So her behavior was so severe you had to evict her?
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Wow, okay, so that's interesting.
What kind of things were going on that you had to evict her, like what was she doing that made it so severe?
Participant:
Well this was a house that was a shotgun house, and the house was almost packed from ceiling to floor with stuff, you could barely get through it, and I was worried about the actual structure of the house because she would put shelving and then put heavy objects on the shelves, which I thought would stress the wall and the floor joists, because there was just so much stuff.
I mean, she has a lot of pottery.
The pottery, from what I remember, was heavy and causing me concern about that.
And then of course there's fire.
And then of course there was rodents.
Interviewer:
So it was definitely a safety concern as much as a structural concern.
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, wow, that’s very interesting.
So our next section is about distress and interference.
So does your clutter upset you?
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer:
So do you think it gets in the way of your daily life.
Could you elaborate on why it upsets you?
Participant:
I think that there might be a circumstance where I would need to lay my hands on something quickly and I wouldn't be able to do it.
I might buy something that I already have, because I can't find it, and that you know it's wasteful, and it's not pleasant to look at.
Like, right now, I'm looking at, oh 1, 2, 3 boxes that are in my living room that you know I'm not using them for anything.
They're not pretty to look at...
Interviewer:
Right, so it causes you distress, because you don't like to look at it, and it might be a financial harm as well.
Participant:
Yeah, and uh it makes me feel like I’m crazy when I know that I have something and I can't find it so it causes me emotional stress because I feel like I'm losing my mind when I think I've just put something down and now it's missing.
