Interviewer:
Done. SILENCE.
Okay. So as you know this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs relating to having hoarding disorder. The first question would be, what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant  004:
I'm not sure. I guess just whatever the standard is.
Interviewer:
We can do hoarding, clutter problems, anything like that.
Participant  004:
Oh, I guess clutter problems. I'm not sure if that's hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay. The next part is more of a conversation. I'll ask you questions for you to answer, and feel free to ask questions if you need clarification. If any questions make you uncomfortable, let me know. You do not need to answer them.
Participant  004:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Can you please describe your clutter problems?
Participant  004:
Oh, there's a lot of stuff just laying around. [INAUDIBLE] I've got some used tissues, there's a couple bags of trash that need to go out in a few days. Let's see, in the living room [INAUDIBLE] there's mail thrown on the table, there's a couple of empty soda boxes that are just [INAUDIBLE]. That's about all I can think of.
Interviewer:
Okay. How long has this been going on?
Participant  004:
Oh. It was worse when I was a kid, because my mom was annoyed with it all the time. I try to be better about it, but its hard.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE. How severe would you say that this behavior is now?
Participant  004:
It's not like anything out of the TV show, but my place is messy enough that I notice it.
Interviewer:
Mm-hm AFFIRMATIVE. Do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Participant  004:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah? Why do you think-
Participant  004:
It is a problem.
Interviewer:
Why do you think that?
Participant  004:
I think it's [just that I don't have a place for everything [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Do your family and friends know about the behavior, and if so, how do they feel about it?
Participant  004:
I never talk about [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Yeah. And you say they don't go to your house?
Participant  004:
Not a lot. [INAUDIBLE] sometimes, but [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Yeah. And have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Participant  004:
Kind of I have. I know [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
And have you ever gone to a professional for help with this behavior?
Participant  004:
No, I don't think it's that bad right now, [INAUDIBLE] other than maybe a professional cleaner.
Interviewer:
Can you please describe where you live now?
Participant  004:
In terms of the clutter, or in terms of the general-
Interviewer:
Like in general, what does your house look like? Like how many rooms?
Participant  004:
Oh, it's just an apartment [INAUDIBLE], it's in a secure building [INAUDIBLE] to key in.
