Interviewee:
Okay. This next section is going to be talking about distress.
Would you say your behavior upsets you?
Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant 012:
At times, it does.
Yeah.
It upsets me that I can't get rid of things.
It can get destructive.
It can interfere with being able to do stuff because stuff is in the way and I have to take time to move it around in order to do something else or whatever but the main thing I think is just constantly seeing things cluttered and not being able to do anything about it and just adding more stuff.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Can you think of a time that it ever really got in the way of something you wanted or is it more of a day to day kind of interference?
Participant 012:
It's just a day to day.
Interviewee:
Okay.
You mentioned previously that your husband has mentioned before like, "Oh, maybe it's time to get rid of things."
Has it ever significantly impacted your relationship?
Participant 012:
No. Interviewee:
Okay.
He kind of knew that you liked to collect the nesting dolls and other things like that from the moment you guys started a relationship?
Participant 012:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Do you think it ever affected your work?
Participant 012:
No. I kept things pretty organized there.
Yeah.
I mean, it didn't affect work ... I had a lot of stuff that I should have gotten rid of over the years.
Of course, I had to once I'm retiring now but it didn't get in the way.
It didn't affect anything.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Was it ever brought up as a concern with any of your coworkers or anything?
Participant 012:
No. Interviewee:
Okay.
When you were growing up, did it ever impact your relationship with your siblings?
Did you guys ever fight over stuff?
Participant 012:
That's a long time ago.
I suppose here and there we would or if my brothers got irritated and wanted to agitate they'd go in and do something with my collections or something.
This, of course, would be very maddening, especially when they broke something.
I can't say that we ever really fought over anything because they didn't have the same interests.
They didn't care.
My sisters and I were far enough apart that it didn't really enter our relationship at all.
Usually they enjoyed it too.
Interviewee:
Okay.
It was more typical of sibling behavior.
Just getting mad and maybe taking someone's stuff but not really impacting it.
Okay.
What about your parents?
Did your parents ever get mad about your collections or threaten to take something away?
Participant 012:
No. I can't say that they ever did.
They actually built me bookshelves so I'd have room to put stuff.
Sometimes they would encourage whatever it was I was collecting.
Some of them were pretty weird but I can't say that they ever were bothered by it.
