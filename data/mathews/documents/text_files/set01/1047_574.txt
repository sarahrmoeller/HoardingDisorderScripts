Interviewer:
Yes, of course. So you mentioned your daughter-in-law and how she felt about it, but have you ever had any other conflicts with people close to you about your collecting, like landlords or other family members or friends?
Participant 47:
I own my own house, so I don't have that. I did one time ... I had what I thought was a break in. It actually was a cat that was in my house in the cellar. This was awhile back, and this was when it was a lot worse. I had one room that papers were just all over the floor in no particular order. He came through with a K-9 unit and he asked me, was somebody ransacking that room. I was so embarrassed. I was like, "No, that was just me." 
So getting his impression of what it looked like was embarrassing to me, so I actually cleaned up that room.
Interviewer:
So his reaction made you want to clean up a little bit. 
Participant 47:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 47:
I haven't really ... My son has not really said anything. The room where my grandson spends is relatively organized. It's creatively organized because he's a lot like my son and he likes to play with lots of different things. 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 47:
But he's allergic to dust, so I make sure that room is clean and dust free and stuff like that.
Interviewer:
Dust free. 
Participant 47:
The kids don't feel like my house is that out of shape, or they wouldn't let him come over. He spends the night and stuff like that. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so it's definitely a livable space.
Participant 47:
Yeah, it's livable. It's just cluttered. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 47:
I don't have any animals, so there's nothing like ... I've seen books about it, the different levels. I would never put any judgment on those people because I have the same problem.
Interviewer:
Of course.
Participant 47:
The ones that have animals and they can't take care of ... the animals are pooping in the house and then that adds to the problem. They can't get to it because it's mixed in with their papers and everything else.
Interviewer:
Of course, yes.
Participant 47:
I think I'm lucky that my son was allergic to cats and I had to actually disown, re home my cat when he was little. My grandson is also asthmatic, so I don't have any animals in the house.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 47:
I think that helps a lot.
Interviewer:
So no animals. Okay.
