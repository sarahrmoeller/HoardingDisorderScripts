Interviewer:
Okay, perfect.
So now we're going to get into the more fun, conversational part of the interview.
And I would just like to start by having you tell me a little bit about your experience with clutter problems, when it started and how it went on and what it's like for you now?
Participant 26:
Okay.
I certainly didn't experience it as a child.
Or in high school or college or even in my twenties and thirties.
I think it probably started after I had children, and I was 37 when I had my first.
It was very hard for me to throw things away, I found a lot of their things meaningful and difficult to part with.
And also I didn't have the time to devote to decluttering.
Interviewer:
Definitely.
Participant 26:
So things just kind of piled up.
Interviewer:
So with you, this problem was kind of related to being a parent?
Participant 26:
Right.
Interviewer:
And you didn't find that prior to having children you had any problems with getting rid of things at all?
Participant 26:
No, thinking back, not really.
I was pretty good about going through papers and not accumulating things.
The other issue is I had a number of eye surgeries that started actually right after I had my daughter, she was eight weeks old.
I had cataract surgery and then I had retinal detachments.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Participant 26:
And so my vision was somewhat compromised, so it's a little harder for me to read and focus.
So that has contributed to the accumulation of paperwork and newspapers, and things that I have been meaning to read but haven't gotten to.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like there are a couple of things that contributed to this all starting, so first it was just having your kids and finding the items associated with them were very sentimental for you.
And then at the same time you had this problem with your eyesight, so it was harder for you to go through papers, and you kept meaning to go through them and then not being able to because of the differences, changes in your vision.
Participant 26:
Right.
Interviewer:
And so that's kind of exacerbated it and made it sort of all start.
How is the behavior now as compared to when it began, do you feel like it's gotten worse over time or it's pretty much been the same the whole time?
Participant 26:
It's better.
My kids are both out of the house so I can't use them as an excuse.
I'm choosing not to accumulate a lot more things including reading material, I've canceled magazine subscriptions, I don't get the newspaper, I get it digitally so there's nothing to pile up.
There's still a backlog of paperwork that I need to deal with and I just frankly don't feel like dealing with it because there's a lot of decision making that would be involved.
