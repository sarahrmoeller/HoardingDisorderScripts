Interviewer:
Yeah, no, of course. You would be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?
Participant 006:
I am upset, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. You're upset currently because you can't get rid of them?
Participant 006:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Do you think you would be even more upset if you had to get rid of them?
Participant 006:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. I see.
Participant 006:
It's crazy.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Did you want to elaborate a little bit on that? On why you think it's crazy?
Participant 006:
Well I want it out of my house. I want it out of my life. But I think I look at it and I think, well I might be able to use that, or that might be something that somebody wants. Even though my children have both told me they don't want any of it, and actually the son who is more organized in his life, he has said to me that if I die, he's just going to have somebody come in and just scoop it out, get rid of everything. I really do need to go through it all and make sure that I keep only what's really possibly of interest to the family and get rid of the rest of it.
Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Participant 006:
I'm getting to the age where I don't want to die and have all this extra they need to go through.
Interviewer:
Then what do you think would be the most important differences between what's considered normal saving behavior like collecting and hoarding disorder?
Participant 006:
I have so many collections, and overabundance of everything. So much of collections that they're no longer valuable, you know what I mean? Yeah, go ahead.
Interviewer:
No, no, no. Finish what you're saying.
Participant 006:
I was just going to say, if I look at any one collection, I have so much of it that it's kind of lost its importance.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Participant 006:
I don't know how to describe that.
Interviewer:
No, you did a good job. Then what would you think is the most important difference, if you started collecting something for value. Then now that you say you have too much of it. What do you think is that line, where it goes into collecting, into hoarding.
Participant 006:
When I don't even know where to put it.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Participant 006:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Let's see. Do you think there's a way to tell if somebody has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant 006:
Perhaps, if I shopped with them and they were constantly picking up little things, like I do. If they were constantly picking up things and they thought, I could use that, or that might come in handy. Then yeah, I would think that they have the same problem.
