There's not enough time.
I don't have enough time to do it, and there are times, almost, when I know that the... I live in Santa Rosa, California where there were those huge fires in the fall of '17, and I know lots of people who lost their homes.
I know people who lost their homes in the fire in Oakland back in '91, and I hear the same people say almost how ever horrible it was to lose all of their families treasures, but there was this incredible sense of relief that came from not having to decide.
