Participant 009:
I do feel a real attachment to certain objects and they bring back memories for me.
My mom died last year and I got stuff from her, so the things that I put out that I got from her and from my dad's house feel important to me, and those are new additions though.
But I do feel a lot of attachment to things and I kind of see it as when I was a kid we moved every year or two as I was growing up.
My dad was in the military and every time we moved my dad would hand me one box and all my personal stuff had to go into that one box so I was always being forced to get rid of stuff, and so I feel like all through my childhood I wasn't allowed to keep things I wanted to keep, including friends.
So, it was a very...
That had a lot of affect on me I think, in a mode, it's making me a little teary eyed.
Interviewer:
No, that must've been very hard.
I can't imagine.
Participant 009:
Yeah.
So, then when I got to be in my 20s and I was living out on my own it like okay, nobody can make me throw anything away again ever.
I'll just keep all this stuff and I live in San Francisco, you can't get me to leave San Francisco.
It's like my home is my home and this is where I am and nobody's going to make me go, so.
Even though my husband at one point tried to get me to move to LA and I'm like, "Nope," but I'm glad.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, when you think about your possessions, what makes the valuable besides maybe the emotional attachment of them?
Participant 009:
Say that again?
Interviewer:
I said when you think of all your possessions, how do you value them?
What makes them valuable?
Participant 009:
Most of it is the memories and then the fact that it's mine, and it's interesting that I have thousands and thousands of pictures and that's one thing I was thinking I just need to go through and decide is this one worth keeping or not and just do a clear out of things like that.
Even though they might not be a great picture, but I look at it and go, "Oh, that's my son," or, "That's so and so," and so it's go to do with memories and the feelings of attachment.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, it sounds like a lot of how you value stuff is the emotional, like the memories, and also the fact that you possess it, it is yours, you own it makes it valuable?
Participant 009:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 009:
A feeling of personal power that it's mine.
