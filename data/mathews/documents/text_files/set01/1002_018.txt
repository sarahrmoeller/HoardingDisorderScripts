Interviewer:
What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Well, I mean, the first thing that comes to mind is situations like the show Hoarders, where it's the extreme. Then I had people on my dad's side, his siblings, some of them were real hoarders, and that on more of the extreme side, they'd have sheds and sheds of stuff. It was a mess and when a couple of them passed away. We had to just sort through some stuff. But I also have understood, just from my own personal living experiences, that it's not always that extreme. You can go through life having... to where it still affects your social life, and your mental well-being, just because you have trouble getting rid of things. You collect things, but you're not... from head to toe, every inch of your house is covered, but it still affects you and your house is still a mess.
Interviewer:
Okay, thank you. For the next section, I'm going to be reading you stories, and I'm going to ask you specific questions afterward, okay?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
First one, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something, or decides to move. When the items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in, he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized, but not usually cluttered. Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend a couple of minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them, when this happens he's rarely late in getting where he needs to be. Okay, so does the person depicted in this story have hoarding disorder, or is it more like clutter problems in your opinion?
Interviewee:
I wouldn't say so much hoarding. I mean, he does have some clutter issues, I've been known to do similar things with keeping boxes in case I need them later, or having trouble locating keys, and things like that. But the way you described it, it's more like he's just keeping boxes and his place is a little messy.
Interviewer:
Do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee:
I mean, he could maybe organize his things a little better maybe, and not worry about the boxes as much. I've learned from own experience that when you move you can go to home depot and get boxes.
