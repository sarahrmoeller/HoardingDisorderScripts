Participant 30:
Right, yeah.
INAUDIBLE I just have to make myself get rid of things, like boxes, but boxes are definitely something that when you need it, you really need it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I'll go ahead and read this next one then.
John Doe has several boxes he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.
He is worried he might get rid of a box that he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy every room.
Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes and his house is extremely cluttered.
Leaving it difficult for him to walk in his own house.
Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for all of them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.
He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.
So the same questions there.
Do you think is a full blown hoarding disorder or more like clutter problems?
Participant 30:
Yeah, if he has to move boxes to still get into the bathroom, I'd say that's a hoarding disorder.
And if boxes are in every room, stacked up, I'd say that's a hoarding disorder.
If it's just boxes, it's probably not as bad, it's probably a far extreme, but yeah, if it interferes with his ability to do what he needs to do then...
Yeah, if it's in every room, I'd say yeah, that's a full blown hoarding disorder.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So he should try and change his behavior?
Participant 30:
Yes.
Interviewer:
How about requiring treatment from a psychiatrist?
Do you think he would fit that category?
Participant 30:
Possibly.
If he could, on his own, or with the help of a friend or relative, see that he has to do something differently, I think it could be something he could deal with without professional help, but there might be underlying issues that cause him to do that, that it would be helpful to have professional help.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Would you consider this behavior similar or different to your own?
Participant 30:
I think that's different.
I'm not quite at the stage where I have to move things to get into the bathroom.
I mean these aren't stacked on the floor.
They're mostly on the tables so yeah, I think I'm INAUDIBLE
