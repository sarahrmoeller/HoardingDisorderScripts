Interviewer:
Okay. What would you say hoarding disorder looks like?
And how is it the same or different from your behavior?
Participant 17:
Hoarding... I always say, "Of course I don't have that, I just collect things."
But, no it's definitely an issue.
As an example, if you said, "Take a picture of your cluttered living room," I would be too embarrassed to.
I did for my therapist and she said, "Oh!" Lack of organization that has gone on too long and carried on too long, would be hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant 17:
No, I don't think so.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 17:
No. I'm going to change that.
They may be drawn to objects or pick up objects that seems silly to others to keep when they're out with other people.
As an example, my rocks.
Perhaps a map of a park that I would pick up and keep, whereas most people would maybe pick up a map of a park and then discard it on the way out.
If you watch people close enough you could probably see that tendency.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Where do you get information about hoarding disorder?
Where have you heard of it?
Participant 17:
Probably psychological journals or research that I've done online after I was accused of being a hoarder.
It felt awful, but it felt right, so I wanted to understand it better.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you mostly looked up research articles and journals online.
Participant 17:
I researched articles and I researched organization things and none of the organization things seemed to fit for me [INAUDIBLE] something I was comfortable with.
Hoarding just helped me understand me better.
Interviewer:
Okay.
If you don't mind me asking, why weren't you comfortable with the organization stuff you read?
Participant 17:
It was too cold, and cut and dried with very little emotion in it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That makes sense, a lot of them are...
Because they don't see how it would be a problem for anyone to do it so they approach it very, this is how it is.
Participant 17:
That they're things, like my oldest son, "That they're things, Mom.
They're just things."
I honestly, if you asked me, could probably sit down and in 10 or 15 minutes make a list of the things that they took out of the house that meant something to me that I miss.
It would have no logical meaning to anybody in the whole wide world, but those things are still painful to me to this day.
Some things I don't miss at all and I thank them for it, but I wonder what else I missed that went out that I didn't catch.
