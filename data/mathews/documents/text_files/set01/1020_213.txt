Interviewee:
Now, it doesn't stop me from sometimes keeping things I'm given.
I just got offered a whole huge two sacks of giveaway clothes, and many of them are gorgeous, and I'm really going to have to make a decision to myself that is this is something I really would wear, or does it duplicate something else I already have?
