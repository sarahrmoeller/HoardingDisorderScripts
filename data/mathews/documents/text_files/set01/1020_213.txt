Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 020:
Now, it doesn't stop me from sometimes keeping things I'm given.
I just got offered a whole huge two sacks of giveaway clothes, and many of them are gorgeous, and I'm really going to have to make a decision to myself that is this is something I really would wear, or does it duplicate something else I already have?
It's going to be hard, because some of the stuff is beautiful, but at least I'm trying to look at it now.
Interviewer:
That's great.

Interviewer:
I am really impressed with the self-reflection that you have on your behavior here.
I just want to kind of say or mirror back to you that it seems like you're a very self-reflective person, and you've really spent a long time trying to understand these impulses.
It's really gratifying to see somebody be able to make this kind of progress with themselves, so congratulations for that.
