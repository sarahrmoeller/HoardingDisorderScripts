Participant 039:
Specifically, because again, it's pretty much the same object, in this case boxes. He has more than one but yet they're different enough that he thinks that for whatever reason, whether he sends out a lot of things or not, if they are different sizes so if one box doesn't fit whatever he's going to send out he'll probably have another that will be even better.
Interviewer:
Okay. It does say that he's worried that he might get rid of a box that he'll need later, but it says stacks of boxes only occupy one of his closets, but they're not anywhere else. Were you, when we were just talking about clutter, you said, "Oh, there's like a pile of some stuff that would be more clutter, whereas if there's a lot more items in a lot of other places then it's probably hoarding." Do you think that this person has hoarding just having boxes in one place?
Participant 039:
Yeah. I think it's the beginning of something that probably will escalate.
Interviewer:
Got it. Okay. All right. I'm going to read another one. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in. He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and his wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he is looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all. Do you think this person has hoarding?
Participant 039:
I think it's a combination of both.
Interviewer:
Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more?
Participant 039:
Well, because he keeps these boxes I would say that's hoarding and I would say that because there's stuff located all over his house to the point that he can't find his keys and maybe not ever, or at least for the time that he needs them, that's due to clutter.
