Interviewer:
Okay. Now, I'd like to get more into the fun part, where we just get to kind of talk. I want to open by asking you to tell me a little bit about your clutter problems, just in terms of your life. When did they begin? How they changed over time, and what is it like now?
Participant 020:
Let's see. I think they probably began when I graduated from college. I may have had things that I didn't really need, but I'd been having to live in such limited spaces that I didn't have much room to collect or much money to spend to collect anything. I think some of it got noticeably worse when I was able to get my first credit card, so the habits that I had as a student of having to be careful to a while to... The protected habits dissolved more.
I think partly it was watching... My mother was a very bad housekeeper, and she had some very beautiful things, but her house was always very, very, very dirty. There was some part of that that kept making me want things that felt clean, that felt new. I don't think any of this was conscious, you understand. I'm looking back on it in retrospect. Consciously, it was just I want this. I want this shirt. I want this book. It's also partly that back when I was in my 20s and 30s, the cost of things like books and food and things [inaudible 00:31:55] were a lot lower. I could get books for 10 cents apiece.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 020:
And even when I was only having $150 a month on top of rent, I could get 10 books for a dollar, where that was a small enough component of my income that it was possible. Then I think when I started earning money and I had trouble with relationships, I had to, again, cope with the fact that I didn't seem to attract much interest from men or the men that I liked. Then I started buying things, because they gave me comfort in some way. I also had a very wide range of interests musically, intellectually, so I'd hear a song and want to go out and buy the record, or see something and want a book here. Bought a book. Go into a bookstore and see 10 books I wanted, and for a while, when I had a credit card, before I started thinking about this stuff, I would just get them. I don't think I had much impulse control. 
The major thing that controlled my spending and my acquisition was my fear of ending up on the street. That was the one thing that would stop me. But I've also learned to like... My father and my stepmother, both of them, were compulsive spenders and somewhat hoarders, though less so than my mother, I think, in some ways. But they taught me to really appreciate beautiful things. They would tell the difference between something that was well made, something that wasn't. They didn't do it constantly. They were interested in antiques, and I would go shopping with them, and they would show me these things. 
Because I have a strong sense of aesthetics, I would [inaudible 00:34:09] to that stuff. As I got older and more and more began to realize that I was never going to be able to afford the kinds of things that I thought were beautiful, then a lot of resentment began to come in, I think. Then I started focusing more on acquiring cheap things, not cheap in the sense of badly made, but used things. 
Interviewer:
So it's kind of-
Participant 020:
I don't know. When I look back on it, I see it as a much more gradual kind of addiction than the amount of times that it took me to really get hooked on alcohol or on cigarettes. It was a much longer time.
Interviewer:
It sounds like it was-
Participant 020:
Much more-
Interviewer:
... it was tied... I'm trying to say back to you what you've said to me.
Participant 020:
Right.
Interviewer:
But it sounds like it was tied to both kind of like a lifestyle that you were looking for from your father and stepmother, a sense of aesthetics and beauty that you felt that you didn't have access to and-
Participant 020:
Right. And the thing about both of my parents, both sides, is that they were not the kind of people that would go out to Macy's and buy a bedroom set. They were interested in old things that had some value, so a person who would read Architectural Digest, or any of those House Beautiful things, would go into their homes and go ick. But I knew that a lot of what they had was valuable, and I learned how to recognize what was beautiful about a lot of old things especially.
