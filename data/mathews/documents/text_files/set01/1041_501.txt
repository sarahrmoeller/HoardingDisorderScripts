Participant 041:
I just would like for me to really continue to work on having [INAUDIBLE] because in the past, which made things difficult to keep organized, is I would keep paper and body care items in one place.
So if I was looking for a body care item and I couldn't find it, I would just go and buy double or triple of something.
Now I've been really focusing on, "Okay, I have this or I have this.
I know where it is," so I can easily go find it instead of having to go through this whole thing of where to find it.
So, I know where 80% of my stuff is and now I'm trying to get to where I know where 90% of my stuff is.
Interviewer:
All right.
So how important would you say your things are for you to feel at home?
Participant 041:
Very important because, I mean a hotel is one thing but you want to feel comfortable in your home.
I feel very comfortable.
Now it's just using up this stuff that I have so it's not so "this is a lot."
I'm looking at my room, "Okay, I see some more stuff I can do."
Interviewer:
Okay.
So which things or which objects would you say are most important for you and that you spend most of your time with?
Participant 041:
Well my Fire Stick.
I use that a lot.
My clothes.
I wear those.
I've been wearing a lot of the same stuff because I'm not going anywhere.
My, oh.
That was a flashlight.
Clothes and my body care, because I have sensitive skin so I have to be very careful of the different things that I use.
[INAUDIBLE] makeup and nail polish, and of course family pictures and purses.
I have some heirlooms and stuff that I was given, so I have a lot of pictures of deceased family members and different stuff, so those are important to me, and then the makeup and stuff that I wear, and purses too, and jewelry.
I don't know, it's a lot of stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So when you think about all these possessions, what makes them valuable and how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
