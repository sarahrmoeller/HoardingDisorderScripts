Participant 24:
I decided to keep the ones that were the most informative to me in the beginning. Because some of them, you get, and maybe there's only a half a chapter that really pertains to what you want. And I thought, "I don't need all these books because I don't need all that information anymore." And the ones that I kept were the ones that would, if I give any counseling again, those might be the ones that I might go to.
Interviewer:
So you were looking for the ones that were the most potentially useful?
Participant 24:
Correct. Yes. And that probably applies to the kitchen too. Because I had so many knives, forks and spoons. Because I had kept my mother's silver, I kept some of the silver I had, but I was now using stainless steel. And I just thought when I went through those, I thought, "I can't eat all these. I don't have that many people to use all this in my house." So, the things that are most useful, I keep. The rest I can get rid of. Now, if you talk about things out in the garage or back in the third bedroom, those are where all the emotional things are.
Interviewer:
And so when you go through those things, if you were to clean up those spaces, how would you decide which of those things to keep?
Participant 24:
Well, I remember telling you toward the end of the last week, that when I go through the emotional things, what I do is I may take, let's say there's 10 emotional items. I may take one or two out, think, "I don't want to keep this." And then I just shift the other eight to another place of the same room.
Interviewer:
So you can get rid of some of those things, but not all of them, and you end up just moving around?
Participant 24:
That's right. That's right. Yes.
Interviewer:
When you think about your home and the items that are in it, what do you think are the most important or valuable items? What is most important to you out of the stuff that you keep in your home?
Participant 24:
If I think of the whole house, of all the things in the house? Well, that's a good question because that's the kind of question I'd asked myself if a fire started.
Interviewer:
That's one way of thinking about it.
