Interviewer:
Yeah. It does sound like with COVID, you've become harder on yourself, because you recognize that you've been at home, and this extra time in your life, it has caused you to feel badly about why this isn't being put towards organizing.
Does that sound accurate?
Interviewee:
It's accurate, but I wouldn't put everything on that, because it's just, that's just another way to make myself feel guilty, and feel bad about myself for not handling it.
The COVID's just another-
Interviewer:
COVID's another-
Interviewee:
... reason to feel bad about myself.
Interviewer:
Yeah, that makes sense.
For the end of the interview, I have a couple questions for you about hoarding disorder.
I kind of want to preface that by saying, everybody we interview is on a spectrum of behaviors.
I'm asking about your ideas of this disorder.
It's up to you, I'm not at all diagnosing you with this disorder, I'm just asking you questions about your knowledge of it.
When you think about hoarding disorder, what do you know about it?
Where have you heard of it?
Interviewee:
Mostly just watching TV.
That hoarding show.
Though in some perverse way, I felt comforted by, I'm not really a hoarder, or I'm on the low end of it, because I don't have little narrow pathways to get ...
You know what I'm saying.
Interviewer:
I'm not as bad as the people.
Interviewee:
I'm not nearly as bad as those people are, and that even though I've got clutter and mess all around, it's not intervention time.
Interviewer:
You've mostly seen it on that show, and have seen it as a thing that's the most extreme example of this kind of behavior.
It's almost-
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
... been good to see that other people are so much more extreme than what you've been experiencing.
Interviewee:
That, and then there was a very wealthy family in Houston, and I think it was a mother and son, lived in this wonderful mansion in River Oak, where the homes start at a couple of million.
Their house caught fire, and the firemen couldn't get in the front door to do anything, to get them rescued, and they both died-
Interviewer:
Oh my goodness.
Interviewee:
... of it.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Interviewee:
I thought, nope, not there.
I'm okay, it's all good.
Interviewer:
I can still get out of my house in a fire.
Yeah.
That's incredible.
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
You never really think about happening in places like that, in a huge mansion like that.
You got to wonder what that was like.
Interviewee:
Really.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
I guess that begs the next question I was going to ask you, which is, in your mind, what is the difference between something like hoarding disorder, or even a lesser version of it, having a problem with clutter, and having a collection or being a collector?
Often, when I interview people, they have collections of things, or they have things that they do collect.
How do you make that distinction?
