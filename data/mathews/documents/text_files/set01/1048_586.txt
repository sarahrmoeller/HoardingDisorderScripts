Participant 48:
Every surface pretty much is stacked with things. Not necessarily, almost none of the same things, just different things. For the longest time, and I got so close once, I wanted to have the kitchen counter cleared, right? And I'll get close to that, and then two days later, I'll weigh in, and there'll be stuff all over the counter again. When I go to clean one area, invariably I move stuff around and put it in other areas. The easy chair, the lounge chair in my room, is covered almost to the ceiling with stuff. You know, boxes of stuff, suitcases, a bag of things I intend to sell sometimes. Paperwork. And a lot of the room is that way. One corner I have things stacked up literally to the ceiling in plastic bins and stuff. And I haven't had access to that, or haven't made access to that in more than a year. So clearly this is not stuff that is necessary in my life. I haven't used that whole pile in more than a year. I could just take all that away and have that space.
Interviewer:
Right. So do you think that, as you mentioned, the counter tops are covered with things and such, do you think there are parts of your home that aren't being used in the way that they're intended to be used?
Participant 48:
Well, I mean, my living room is a open social space for everyone that lives here. I mean, I use a lot of it, too. I use a lot of my space as storage. And San Francisco apartments aren't known for ample storage at all.
Interviewer:
Understood.
Participant 48:
Other than that, you know, it's not like I have books in the bathtub or anything. The kitchen is clear, except for things on the counter. And there are times when I'll make a conscious effort, put five hours into it. I don't think I could do it in half an hour. It'll take me six and a half hours, but I'll get the counter almost cleaned off. But the kitchen sink and all the dishes and everything are always clean. The bathroom's always clean, cleaned several times a week. Those areas are not impacted at all by the hoarding. My shelves are pretty full, though, yeah. My cupboards are pretty full. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So those rooms that you have things stacked up, the countertops, would you consider those areas cluttered?
Participant 48:
Yes, absolutely. 
Interviewer:
What about, are there any other areas, and what do you consider to be cluttered?
