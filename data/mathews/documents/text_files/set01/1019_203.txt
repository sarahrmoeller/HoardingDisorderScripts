Interviewer:
So what is the saving like in your home right now? Would you say that it's severe, would you say it's under control?
Participant 019:
I'd say it's certainly not under control. I feel like right now, I've uncovered a bunch of things that I want to start on after we have this call done. I just feel like there are so many parts of my house that could, that demand some attention to make decisions and throw out. So I think that at this point, it's become, with age and the fact that I have to decide what the next step will be in my life, in order to not leave a mess for my children to clean up when I have ignored the warning signs that you need to organize what you have. So I'm getting a little bit more alarmed and bothered by this. 
Interviewer:
So it's becoming more and more of a problem for you because with age, you see that you're going to need to organize things. You mentioned the idea of selling your house, is that something that you're considering or that would be on the table for you?
Participant 019:
It's not coming up right away, because we have too many things that we enjoy about where we are right now. But we know, I'm speaking of my wife and I, we know that we need to develop a plan for enjoying the next step, without the maintenance of a house. 
Interviewer:
That makes sense. So while neither of those things are immediate problems for you, you recognize that the behavior will be a problem in the future if you don't deal with it now. 
Participant 019:
Right, right. And the value of the house will be enhanced if people come and see that things are, the people who lived here who are organized. 
Interviewer:
Have you ever made an effort at any point in your life to change this behavior or to either get professional help for it, or to even just try to change it on your own or with the help of friends and family?
Participant 019:
Yeah, sure. My kids will come and say, "Dad, let's go through this." My wife will be supportive and say, "Participant 019, if you do this, I will help you with that." And I recently went through my garage and took things apart and repainted everything twice and organized it. But of course, the creeping, the little sections that you don't get done begin to crowd in again. I have been slow that I'm discovering my organization, that I have to just work on, keep it under control. It's time, that stuff is getting ... The danger signs, it looks like a rat's nest. Time to decide what is a never-to-be-used dream and what could be useful in the future.
