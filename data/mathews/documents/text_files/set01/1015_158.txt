Interviewer:
Okay. So the next thing you briefly covered it, but we're going to talk about space and living area.
So can you please describe like where you live now and what the space looks like?
Participant 015:
It's just my husband and myself.
But when we moved in here there was the five kids with us, and they've all gone on their own.
So we have a five bedroom house that's 2,600 square feet and pretty good sized property too.
About a third of an acre in the suburbs and it's a colonial, so all the five bedrooms are upstairs and then it's got a basement as well, two car attached garage.
So it's nice, but it's not super duper grand.
Interviewer:
All right.
And so you mentioned before that none of the doorways or anything are blocked, are there any rooms that you don't use for the intended purpose?
Is there a bathroom that might be just full of stuff that you guys don't use anymore or anything like that?
Participant 015:
No. The other four bedrooms all have beds in them.
Sometimes I put stuff just randomly on the bed until I can get to it.
For instance, when I was home with the COVID stuff, I had all kinds of pictures laid out in the one bedroom in piles, and then had to clean it all up and put it away before our daughter and her three kids came last week for a visit.
So I was able to clean it up and put it away, but I wasn't very speedy at getting the project done.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So you would just say that your house is more cluttered, but it's not overrun with your items, let's say.
Participant 015:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would say.
There's surfaces that things are on and I should be putting the items away, but it doesn't always happen.
Interviewer:
But you can walk freely through each room.
Participant 015:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So what would you like your house to look like.
Participant 015:
A picture in a magazine, but I don't think that's going to happen.
I guess, I would just like more of the things to be cleaned up.
For instance, in my bedroom, I have a chest drawers and when I fold clothes, I put them on top intending to get to them later.
And then most times that pile just sits and sits and gets added to once in a while I clear it, solve it off.
Put it away in drawers, but probably doesn't ever get completely cleaned up.
And I think that's because the drawers are so full and then compounds itself.
So stuff like that just needs a better away space, put away space.
