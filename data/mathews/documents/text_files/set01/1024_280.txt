I think I told you this last week.
That some of them are collections because they don't have any emotional ties to them.
Part of it might have emotional ties, but the rest of them don't.
Because I don't know if you're familiar with the little Hallmark Christmas ornaments things?
When did they start that?
20 years ago, or so.
I collected those that had to do with old time houses and that.
And that was a collection, which I still have, but I have it in a box and thinking this, when they open up or I can donate things, I can donate it.
That was a collection.
Although, the collection I've got left of the antique bottles, some of those I don't think I'd part with until the day I die or something.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like you have several collections.
And they're collections because you don't feel necessarily that you've got them because of emotional attachment, but because you were looking for this kind of item.
And so for example, with your Hallmark ornaments, you could give those away, because even though you collected them, you're not attached to them.
Interviewee:
That's correct.
Interviewer:
But the bottles, even though it's a collection, you still feel emotionally attached to the bottles.
Is that because you collected them with your husband and there are memories attached to acquiring them?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
So do you feel like you are-
Interviewee:
Although some things ... well, you see, I collected those, but I never did anything with them.
So in my thinking, that's kind of hoarding because I never put them out.
I never made them a little scenery or something at Christmas time.
I never did anything with them.
I would think, "Oh, I like this."
And then I put it in a box and I'd pile them up in this box.
So that was hoarding, because I never did anything with it.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Interviewee:
And that's true of several things actually.
And that's hoarding because I never showed it to anybody.
I never did anything with it.
I just hoarded it.
Interviewer:
So for you, the difference is that you haven't used the items and they're not on display, they're just in a box somewhere.
And that makes it-
Interviewee:
Yeah, they're of no use.
Yes.
Although I have a whole half closet full of pants, which they could be Levi's, they could be nice pants, whatever that I would just buy because I liked it.
And I thought, "Oh, I'll wear this sometime."
But I've never worn it.
So that's hoarding too.
Interviewer:
So kind of having things that you don't use or even look at, that's where it-
Interviewee:
Yeah, but I know that they're there.
Yes.
