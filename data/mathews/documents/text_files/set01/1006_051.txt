Participant 006:
The fact that you have to move things to even take a shower, that's even more extreme than I am.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Do you think that this kind of behavior should require treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 006:
Possibly. I don't really know about that, that's what I need to learn about.
Interviewer:
Okay. Is this behavior similar or different to yours?
Participant 006:
Part of it's similar, in that I keep a lot of craft stuff in thinking that I might need it. I have some stuff in almost every room. Although I don't have anything in my bathrooms and my guest room. But mainly it's my hallway, then my craft room. Then I have a pile of stuff in my living room that I'm constantly working on, trying to go through. I can use my kitchen and bathrooms and stuff with no issue.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 006:
Like I said, I never had problems with, well, I shouldn't say I never did. I haven't for many, many years had trouble with finding keys or anything like that. Once I decided where it was going to be, and always made sure it was there.
Interviewer:
Okay. When it goes to getting to places, and your car keys and such, do you have a designated spot for that? Or do you just always remember where it is?
Participant 006:
Yeah I have a designated spot, partly because I can't remember where things are half the time.
Interviewer:
Okay, okay. Then despite all the clutter and everything, that's always been a constant for you?
Participant 006:
Yeah, for the last 30 years, 40 years, probably yeah.
Interviewer:
Good.
Participant 006:
Early in my life, no. I used to have a lot of trouble. I always felt like, this sounds terrible, because I hate to blame my mother. She was a wonderful mother. But I wasn't taught how to organize, as a kid. I only learned that later, through working and school. Yeah, organization's been a real problem for me.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Participant 006:
I have two sisters, who are the opposite of me. They're very neat, very tidy. My mother was very neat and tidy. I just always felt that I never learned it, I don't know why.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Participant 006:
Sorry.
Interviewer:
No, no, no, don't apologize, you're good. Do you think that your sisters did retain the information that your mother tried teaching you? Or do you not feel like your mother tried teaching you any kind of organization?
Participant 006:
Yeah. I was not taught any. In fact, my mom never, when we had to move her into an Alzheimer's facility a few years ago, we realized she had never kept paperwork. We had to reconstruct things. She never filed things. I just never learned that from her.
Interviewer:
Was that a case of, she never filed them, and instead she just threw them away?
Participant 006:
Yes.
