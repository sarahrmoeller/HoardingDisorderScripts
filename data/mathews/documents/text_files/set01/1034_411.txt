Interviewer:
If you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Participant 34:
I think just going from area to area and tossing things into boxes, like donate, destroy, recycle, shred. Maybe shred and destroy are the same. Some things are confidential information. You want to shred so no one can ever read it. Others are just recyclable material. 
And then things you definitely want to keep or donate or share different donation spots in mind, you'd have, for me, I conceive it as a project of having areas on the bed, our large bed laid out as where to place these things or boxes. Just sort them out. And it's just work from there on. What are you donating to Goodwill or to whatever they, the senior center or where ever you have places that you can donate stuff to. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. It sounds like from how you're talking, that whenever, discarding items may not cause a ton of stress or duress for you. And that's not the reason you're keeping the items. It might just be that they've had value for you up to this moment and it's the action of actually getting around to evaluating if they still hold that value for you. 
Participant 34:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 34:
That's a good way of putting it. 
Interviewer:
So it's just-
Participant 34:
And if there's something that I just don't have any use for, it's broken or I don't even want to look at it anymore, then throw it away. But otherwise, I don't. 
Interviewer:
There isn't necessarily a supreme attachment to most of the items that you have. It seems that you keep them for the purpose of wanting to be useful, whether that be to you or to other individuals, like you said, history taking. So how you distinguish normal saving behavior such as collecting and then behavior like yours, with difficulties with clutter to the point where you can't see the floor in a certain room. 
Participant 34:
I know for me, it's like I said, the quality of things, like the variety of things I'm keeping, not because I feel an attachment, but because I feel the possibility of needing the item in the future. I don't have a place. I'm disorganized, so I don't have clear, defined places for different types of things. Like I know which drawers I have, which kinds of shirts and underwear and socks and such. And so I hang up hangable clothes and so on. And so clothing is not usually a disorder. It seems pretty well organized. But now, I've been working for the census most of the year. I've got my writing. I've got personal papers and bills and so on, which I keep sorting and moving around because I don't have well defined places in which to keep each type of document or paper or publication.
