Participant:
No, no, no, no. That’s okay. I don’t like to be told to choose. You know, because It’s like I’m afraid you’re going to say, “would you choose your family or your stuff.”

Participant:

Interviewer:
Ok.
Participant:
It’s all important to me.
Interviewer:

Participant:
If I get rid of this, that’s my business. If I get rid of that, that’s my sentimental stuff. So, nothing’s going you know.
Interviewer:
ok.
Participant:
I just need to get UNCLEAR that’s the thing that UNCLEAR me.
Interviewer  right. Ok. So now we are going to move on to the section about distinguishing hoarding disorder. So, what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?
Participant:
You’re asking me?
Interviewer:
Yes, like what’s the difference between someone just wanting to save something and someone who has hoarding disorder?
Participant:
Well I can answer that one because before I got really, really bad I used to love black and white cows. But when I would collect them I had a certain place for them. They we like in glass things. I mean I had every cow thing there was. I kept them in a certain place. They weren’t all over. And then there’d come a time where I had to leave because we had a mold situation in one of our houses. It didn’t bother me. Ok? Hoarding, I mean I got upset the minute you asked me what was more important.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant:
Yup. That upset me. Everything’s important.
Interviewer:
Ok. So, you’d say…
Participant:
That’s the difference my reaction.
Interviewer:
Go ahead. So you’d say the main difference between normal behavior and hoarding disorder is that saving behavior there is not as much of an emotional attachment but whereas with hoarding disorder there is.
Participant:
Yes. You know yeah. Its mental. That’s where your mental thing comes in.
Interviewer:
Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
