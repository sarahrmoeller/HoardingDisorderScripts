Interviewer:
Just like really the care for the items, kind of.
That's actually interesting because seeing someone take really good care of their items, that obviously shows that they value them more, which in turn taught you to value items more.
Which, probably then, had you pick that up, start hoarding and stuff.
Interviewee:
Exactly.
Exactly.
Interviewer:
Very interesting.
Okay.
Let's see, what was my next question?
I guess, now I kind of want to differentiate between a collector and a ... I don't like saying "hoarder," but someone that hoards.
I guess, my question is, what is that line for you?
What do you think differentiates those two?
Interviewee:
I think of collectors ... I have a friend that collects a lot of stuff.
So, I'm going to try to relate it back to him.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
He'll collect something for a few years, and then when he's done collecting it he'll just get rid of all of it.
It's no skin off his back.
It doesn't' bother him in the slightest.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Interviewee:
And the stuff that he collects, there's some value, like with comic books, or he's collected Matchbox cars for awhile.
Right now, it's games.
Interviewer:
So, he goes through the effort to collect all this stuff and then just gets rid of it?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Well, the fun for him is in the collecting.
Interviewer:
Right.
And then just sells it all?
Interviewee:
Yeah, and he'll often make money by doing it.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Yeah.
Hopefully.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I mean, I'm sure not always.
That's not really why he does it.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
But he gets a lot of pleasure out of collecting and acquiring it but not really having it.
And I think in my case, and my dad's case, it's in having the stuff.
It's not in the acquiring or collecting it so much.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, this ...
Your friend, it's more kind of like a game, kind of like a hobby, and for you it's having those items that represent family ...
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
... And connection.
Got it.
Is there a way to tell if someone has a hoarding disorder without being in their home, do you think?
Interviewee:
Hmm.
I would that ...
Yeah, I'm sure there's some connection to obsessive behavior, that sort of anxiety, or that ...
I'm not a psychologist.
Interviewer:
Of course.
Interviewee:
You know, I've coming from maybe a pop-psychology perspective, but I think it would ...
People that have higher anxiety ...
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
... I think would be more likely to hard or collect stuff.
They're more neurotic, I guess.
There's probably ...
Cause I guess personality traits and if you know how they view certain things, or we were just talking about it, they treat stuff ...
Interviewer:
Right.
