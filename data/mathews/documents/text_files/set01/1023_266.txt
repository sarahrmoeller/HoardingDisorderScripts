Interviewee3:
Oh, I see that I have a lot of it.
I think I have it in a manageable extent, but I think wording disorder it's a compulsive behavior.
It's an attachment to things that...
You can be overly attached to things that have value that things also that don't and inability to differentiate between those things.
And yeah, so there's an accumulation of stuff and the specific stuff varies from person to person but it tends to be more than just...
It's weird to find someone just towards one thing.
It tends to be sort of a theme in their life with different specific areas.
But I think it's just a matter for me of extent.
I've been able to manage it so that it doesn't take over my home or my life or my relationships.
So I do interventions so I don't allow myself to.
But it's the attachment to the things, the inability to get rid of things, a prioritization of that over other things that people more often prioritize, like cleanliness, relationship, ease of life.
It's a mental health issue.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee3:
I think for me, there's both.
There's a judgment of it, but there's also an empathy, a connection to it because I know I struggle with it.
So I feel sort of a sense of understanding of it, but it overwhelms me.
I don't enjoy watching hoarding shows because looking at the houses, I know that I'm not at that place but I could be and I find it very overwhelming.
It's very overwhelming and bothersome to me.
And I also know that it's so much deeper than just the superficial manifestations so that even when people do have interventions and they get help and they clean it up, it's so much deeper than that.
And it's so much harder to actually make the changes that you can sustain because it's dealing with those driving need to accumulate, whether you're trying to cover up from trauma or other whatever the psychological reasons are behind it.
It's so much deeper than the stuff.
So those shows are just really overwhelming and bothersome to me.
And I think probably because I can connect on such a deep level and it's hard for me to address that.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So you would say somewhat, you feel kind of a little bit uncomfortable when you hear those words and think of the show because you know that what they're displaying is on a superficial level you know from experiencing from family and other aspects, that there are a lot of other things below that superficial level that kind of manifest that way.
Interviewee3:
Mm-hmm .
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Interviewee3:
No, but I think it's important for me to acknowledge that.
So it's not something that I want to avoid talking about or acknowledging.
Yeah.
