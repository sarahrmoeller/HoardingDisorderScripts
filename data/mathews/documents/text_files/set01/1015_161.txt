Interviewer:
Okay. So this next section is distinguished about talking about hoarding disorder itself and how people view it. So what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting and hoarding disorder?
Participant 015:
I think collecting has an order to it and a space for it. Like if you're collecting shells or something, you would have them all in one area and a designated place to work on your project. Whereas hoarding is pretty haphazard and there's no particular place for what you've got and you probably can't find it.
Interviewer:
What would you say hoarding disorder looks like and how is it the same or different from your behavior?
Participant 015:
I think hoarding is worse than I have because if I put my mind to it, I can clean up. Even though sometimes I have a hard time getting rid of things, I think hoarders can't get rid of anything and in particular garbage, that is all over houses. Whereas I think of my house as clean, but cluttered, maybe it's not as clean as I think.
Interviewer:
So do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant 015:
I don't know of any way. In fact, I know one couple who is supposed to be hoarders, but when I've seen them out and about, I've never seen their house. But when I've seen them, they look very put together except for their car. So until I was told, I did not know about these people.
Interviewer:
Where have you heard of hoarding disorder? Have you gotten any information on it or?
Participant 015:
The TV show, of course. And then in talking about this couple to other people, but not to them, they don't know that. And just in general, I've never really gone to any formal training or specific conference or anything like that.
Interviewer:
So what did people tell you about this couple? What was the information that they gave you.
Participant 015:
That they were hoarders and that their house has just one little path to walk through. One of their bathrooms, at least doesn't work very well, the sink does not work. And I don't know them real well, but that's what I've heard. Of course, I've never been to their house or anything.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was just curious what people say about the disorder. So when you watched Hoarders, what did you take away from that show?
Participant 015:
Certainly, I'm sure they bring the most extreme people on for the effect. But it's obvious that it's a mental disability, or something going on in their brain that they can not give up even on trash. So I don't know how they got that way and like I said, I'm sure plenty of degrees of it but the people they bring on I'm sure are the worst.
Interviewer:
Yeah. They do bring on the really extreme cases.
Participant 015:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
