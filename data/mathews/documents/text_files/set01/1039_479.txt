Interviewee:
It's going to be difficult for both of us to get rid of our stuff and at least [NAME] has nephews and nieces that will inherit her things.
I still have five living brothers and sisters and nieces but I'm completely estranged from all of them except one niece.
My problem in COVID, it's made me think about this.
I'm going to have to start thinking and I have started to, what am I going to do with all this stuff.
I don't want to have a tag sale because, again, people being on my property would give me a nervous breakdown.
Also, you're expected to sell things for just a few dollars and the kind of things that I would have to sell are not worth just a few dollars.
I'm really in a predicament.
Interviewer:
COVID has made you kind of think about all your items that you have and what your plan is to get rid of them or who to give them when you pass?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Well, that's good that's kind of made you think about that.
Has it affected your physical health or your mental health or anything like that?
Interviewee:
Well, I normally take an antidepressant, if fact two of them, because I'm clinically depressed.
So severely enough that if I miss my pill for whatever reason, my pills.
then I become depressed very quickly.
When that happens I'm almost paralyzed.
I always make myself get out of bed, there's never been a time that I have said, "No, I just can't face the world today."
I do get up, but oh, gosh, I don't get anything done, because the attitude is, "Why should I do anything, I'm just going to die."
Interviewer:
Sure.
Yeah.
That makes sense.
I think a lot of folks with depression struggle with that.
That is kind of what it is, we live and we die, so what's the point, but that's nice you can be on antidepressant and seems like that probably helps.
I don't know if this makes you feel better but a lot of, depression is the highest comorbidity with hoarding so a lot of folk that are struggling with hoarding are also depressed.
Interviewee:
Is that right?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Right.
It's an interesting thing there.
Hasn't COVID affected your family financially at all?
Interviewee:
No. We're both on Social Security and [NAME] does freelance work.
She was a professional editor so she still does freelancing.
I just live off of my Social Security.
Interviewer:
So you guys are good there, that's good to know.
CROSSTALK
Interviewee:
I have Medicare and Medicaid and she has insurance carried over from her previous job.
No, financially we're in good shape unless really something drastic in the world were to happen.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
That's good.
Interviewee:
Yeah, it is good.
