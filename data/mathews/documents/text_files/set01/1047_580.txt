Participant 47:
Yeah, I just kind of think that ...
I've read too about people having ... they attribute it to abuse in your past and all sorts of different subconscious problems that you've had growing up, and it exhibits that way.
I've explored that kind of thing.
It's so weird because sometimes I can totally let go of my stuff, and other times it's just like ...
My daughter-in-law asked me for a jar of agates and I couldn't give them to her.
That's like my very, very, very favorite thing.
I was like, "What are you going to use them for?"
Usually I can give people anything, but that's my thing.
Interviewer:
That's one of your ... yeah.
Participant 47:
My son always, because he knows how much I love all this stuff, he told me, when I die, he's just going to take all of it and just scatter it all over the beach.
I'm like, oh I guess I'll have to give it to someone else before I go then, because I was hoping he'd hang on to some of it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 47:
But he kind of learned from her that you don't hold on to things.
That's the way you really should be.
Things should kind of come and go, flow through.
Interviewer:
Right.
You just have trouble parting with your favorite things.
Participant 47:
Yeah, and other things, a whole house full of things.
Interviewer:
Of course.
Okay, well those are all the questions I have for you.
Now I'm just going to ask you a couple of very easy demographic questions.
So of course, if you don't want to answer these, that's completely up to you.
Can you tell me your gender identity?
Participant 47:
Female.
Interviewer:
Your sex assigned at birth?
Participant 47:
Female.
Interviewer:
Your race?
Participant 47:
Caucasian.
Interviewer:
Ethnicity?
Participant 47:
Polish.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Your household income?
A range is all right.
Participant 47:
Yeah, it's kind of tricky.
This year it was 50,000.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Your geographic region, so northeast-
Participant 47:
Pacific northwest.
Interviewer:
Okay, and your highest level of education, although you've mentioned.
Participant 47:
Bachelors degree.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay, my last question is if you prefer an electronic Amazon gift card or a physical Amazon gift card by mail.
Participant 47:
If I have a physical one, can I still use it online?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 47:
Yeah, I'll do that.
Interviewer:
Okay, perfect.
So thank you again for participating.
We really appreciate your help as we try to-
Participant 47:
Do you have my address?
Interviewer:
Interviewer will most likely email you for it.
I just don't want to have it on the recording.
Participant 47:
Oh, okay.
Interviewer:
So again, we really appreciate this.
If you have any questions, you can email Interviewer and she'll be happy to answer any questions for you.
Participant 47:
Am I going to get some ... they said something about a transcript of it.
Interviewer:
I actually don't know, but you can definitely email her.
We're still going to be transcribing this within the week, but if you do want any of the research that we come up with with this study, we can definitely give those to you, although it might take a little bit of time.
Participant 47:
Is it still ongoing?
Interviewer:
Yeah, this is an ongoing project.
Participant 47:
You guys have been going for a while because I've ...
Were you the group that took blood from me?
Interviewer:
I actually don't know about that.
We just started interviewing people this week, so it's relatively new.
I just came onto this a couple of weeks ago, but you can definitely email Interviewer if you do have any other questions that I can't answer.
Participant 47:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay, well thank you so much and have a great day, and stay safe.
Participant 47:
Okay, thank you.
You too.
Bye.
