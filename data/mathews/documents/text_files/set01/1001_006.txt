Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. So the next story, I'm going to read you another story. Here we go. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When the items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for him to walk in his house. Often, it's difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all. So in your opinion does this person have ...
Participant 1:
No. Yes, he's a clutter. He's a terrible clutter and that's not me.
Interviewer:
Clutter. Okay.
Participant 1:
That's not me. I have papers in every room, but I would never have papers so I couldn't get out the door I couldn't ... that's ridiculous. And like things that I have... I have a computer that's old and I want to throw it away but I need to get it right. And it's sitting in my office. It needs to be gotten rid of and I want to get rid of it. It's just I haven't because I don't know where to take it. Sometimes when those things come up, I'm not in the right place at the right time, so those kind of things. But no. I'm not like that. And I'm always usually early or on time, I think. So ...
Interviewer:
Perfect. Okay. And do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Participant 1:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. And why do you say that?
Participant 1:
Yes. Because he can't get through his house. There's something wrong. My aunt had a neighbor like that and I gave her this gift and she gave it to her neighbor, because her neighbor coveted it, but you go to her neighbor's house and she can barely make a path through the house and their neighbor didn't really ... I got mad she gave it away because this neighbor just wanted it to put in her piles of crap. 
Interviewer:
Of course. Yeah.
Participant 1:
People that can't get into their house and stuff like that, there's something wrong. Yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Definitely. Okay. Perfect. So okay. I have another story for you. Okay. John Doe has clothes that he likes to keep in case he needs to use them in the future. Clothes occupy most of his room except for the kitchen and his bedroom.
Participant 1:
Oh my god.
