Interviewer:
And I'd like to talk about your home now.
What is your favorite place in your home?
Where do you spend most of the time when you're at home?
Interviewee4:
I would say in the computer room.
Computer room and kitchen.
Interviewer:
So that's interesting because you said the computer room is one of the most cluttered places and the-
Interviewee4:
Yeah, because that's where the computer is.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So that's where you put all your stuff that you're working on.
Interviewee4:
Yes.
Or a lot of stuff that I might use.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm .
And you like to have it nearby you in case you want to use it?
Interviewee4:
Correct.
Yeah.
Like a book, books or papers, or, although there's a lot of things from my childhood in that room too, on display.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm .
So you kind of-
Interviewee4:
And the closets, well, part of one has clothes in.
The other part has Christmas things in and up above that, it's all craft things.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm .
So it s-
Interviewee4:
Which at one time, let's say at one time I was interested in Teddy bears and I learned how to make Teddy bears.
And so I have all the things to make a Teddy bear.
But when my interest wanes, I don't get rid of it.
I just stash it away somewhere.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm .
That totally makes sense.
Interviewee4:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Yep.
And it sounds like the computer room is a place where you have two things, you have the items from your childhood that you like to look at and have on display because they feel good to you emotionally.
And then you also have all of the items that you have to do all of the activities, which are interesting to you or that you might need to do in that room.
Interviewee4:
Correct.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
And do you like to be in there?
I mean, do you like to sit in your computer room and look at your items around you?
Does that feel-
Interviewee4:
I didn't get that, you faded out a little bit.
Interviewer:
I said, is that a place that you like to be, I mean, does sitting in that room feel comfortable and at home for you?
Interviewee4:
Well, I'm in there because I'm using the computer and now of course, now I'm in there a lot because I'm getting a lot of information on the virus and all these other things and communicating with people on learning how to use Zoom and all that.
