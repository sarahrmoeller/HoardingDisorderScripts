Participant 040:
A great deal.
The interesting part about the books though is that frequently I can find the answer on the Google.
[INAUDIBLE] drink [INAUDIBLE] of water.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Of course.
Participant 040:
I can find those answers on Google.
Just look up anything.
People have put on YouTube the...
No, I don't use Facebook, but YouTube, the answers to your questions are myriad, and so I'm beginning to realize that maybe I don't have to have all of these books.
Interviewer:
Because the answers are on Google or YouTube.
Participant 040:
Yeah, I just have to learn how to use a computer.
My husband was a librarian and he worked with government documents for 30 years, and he thinks like a librarian.
So sometimes I'll ask him, "What shall I ask?
What shall I put in there?" And I can't find the answer, but he can.
So as far as a resource, my husband is [INAUDIBLE].
He's smart.
Interviewer:
Sounds like he has a lot of information.
Participant 040:
Sounds like I what?
Interviewer:
I said it sounds like he has a lot of information and a lot of knowhow.
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So at the opposite of value, what would you consider to be trash, and what do you discard?
Participant 040:
What would I...
Interviewer:
Consider to be...
Oh, sorry.
Participant 040:
That's a hard one.
I would...
Well, there are books that maybe I could get at the library, I wouldn't have to keep it.
I could give them away.
I can't think of anything that would be trash.
Interviewer:
That's okay.
That's okay.
So, do you ever have to decide, or do you ever make a decision that it's time to throw something away, or is that something that's difficult?
Participant 040:
Well, if it truly is trash, like a wrapper-
Interviewer:
Okay, so like something like a wrapper would be-
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Especially if it's something that I don't have to launder or don't have to do something with, that the answer's on the label.
Jars and cans, we got to recycle.
I just put them in the sack and I want to make sure they get out to the recycle.
And I do recycle.
But on the other hand, there are some of these soda bottles that have a beautiful top, and if I take the soda bottles and cut them off, they would make beautiful bells, which is part of these three bucks as a Christmas things.
We got a new Christmas tree.
Interviewer:
Oh, okay.
Participant 040:
A smaller one, because the big one didn't fit.
And I've been trying to make smaller two inch ornaments, but it's more of a thought and a resource than it is an actual fact.
Interviewer:
Do-
Participant 040:
It's like I'm going to do it someday.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Okay, so it's a resource.
Participant 040:
I have three moderately sized cardboard boxes.
Interviewer:
Of bottle caps?
