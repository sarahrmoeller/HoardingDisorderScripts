Interviewer:
Did he ever get upset about not having storage area?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
No?
Interviewee:
No, he never... because he had his room, he had his closet, he had plenty of space.
He was actually somewhat of a slob when he was a kid.
I remember one of my friend's came over to help my son with his computer and he walked in his room and was like, "What?
You can't see the floor."
I'm like, "Okay.
Teenage boy, what can I do?"
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, it never impacted your relationship with him at all?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
So, for this next section what do you figure the most important differences between what is normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Well, I would think collecting is you're collecting things that you love, you're passionate about, that add enjoyment to your life, and that are decorative or useful, for example, my egg cups, I use them.
Hoarding is keeping things that you really don't need that just contribute to clutter and don't give you any kind of happiness or joy.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, we touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you expand on what you think hoarding looks like and how it is the same or different from your own behavior?
Interviewee:
Well, I would say I am a hoarder because I am keeping things that are not necessary or useful or don't add joy to my life and that is visible.
When I look at my desk or open my closet door, it's something you can see.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, do you think there's a way to tell that someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Interviewee:
I don't think so.
Maybe there are.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, where else have you hear about hoarding disorder?
So like-
Interviewee:
CROSSTALK Where else?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So, where do you get your information on it?
Interviewee:
In the news media, in magazines, and I remember when I did encounter this friend who had a really severe problem that I kind of did a little nosing around about it.
So, you can find information on the internet and stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, you mostly just seen it in the news and read about it a little bit?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Oh, and one last thing, you mentioned that you officiate weddings, right?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And you said your behavior never affected your work, right?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay, just wanted to make sure that was what I heard, okay.
So, this next section, they're going to be call vignettes, so basically I'm going to be reading you little mini scenarios and then I'm going to be asking you some questions about them, okay?
Interviewee:
Okay.
