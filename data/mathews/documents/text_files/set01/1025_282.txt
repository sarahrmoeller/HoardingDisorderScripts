Interviewer:
Okay. Now we could switch gears to the second half of the interview, which will be more of a traditional question and answer style.
Do you want to add anything to these lists before we move on?
Participant 25:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Talking about your behavior, can you please describe your hoarding or problems with clutter?
Participant 25:
Well, like I said before, my closets are filled.
I mean we have a four bedroom house and there's two of us that live here, so the closets in all the bedrooms are filled, with a lot of my stuff.
Then our garage is pretty packed.
We don't park in our garage because we have so much stuff.
There's stuff in the attic.
I don't think the main part of the house is technically cluttered, but we have plenty of furniture and stuff.
We don't have a lot of extra space for extra furniture.
It's more filled up than it is empty.
Then the bathroom cabinets and all of that, same, they're filled up with stuff.
We have three bathrooms.
Then I have a tendency to have a purse that's kind of a clutter catch all.
We have drawers that are that way.
My husband is not that way, so he kind of helps balance me.
I have certain drawers that are, excuse me, somewhat cluttered.
I don't know what else.
The insides of my, my clothes where they are in the dresser, in the chest, they're pretty cluttered with the way they're filed away in there.
If you saw my closet my husband's side is very neat and orderly and mine is sort of a train wreck, it's all thrown in there.
I'm okay with it because I know where my stuff is.
Interviewer:
It sounds like your home is still, you're able to use it as your home space and it's not like the clutter is preventing you from moving around any spaces.
Participant 25:
No, no it's not.
Interviewer:
You seem to keep the items contained to spaces pre-determined for storage, except for you mentioned your bathroom.
