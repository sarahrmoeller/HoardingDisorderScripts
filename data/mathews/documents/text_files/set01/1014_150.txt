Interviewer:
Okay. So as you know, this study is investigating individual's attitudes and their beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. So the first question would be, what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 014:
I don't know. You can call it anything you want.
Interviewer:
Okay. So hoarding disorder is fine?
Participant 014:
That's fine.
Interviewer:
Okay. So now we're moving on to the part of the interview that's much more conversational where I'll just ask you a question and you can respond in any way that you see fit. So the first one is, can you please describe your hoarding disorder?
Participant 014:
I just don't like throwing things away.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And does it-
Participant 014:
Unless they're definitely trash.
Interviewer:
Okay, and-
Participant 014:
But if they have a use, I accumulate them.
Interviewer:
Okay, so just they're nothing in particular? Just anything that could have a use?
Participant 014:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay. And how long has this been going on for?
Participant 014:
As long as I can remember.
Interviewer:
Okay. And how severe would you say that this behavior is now? Is it better than when it was when you were a child or worse or the same?
Participant 014:
Maybe a little bit better.
Interviewer:
Okay. And why would you say that it's better now?
Participant 014:
Because now my husband's sorting through boxes and I'm letting him get rid of somethings.
Interviewer:
Okay. And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Participant 014:
I don't think so.
Interviewer:
Okay, so...
Participant 014:
But I don't have a lot of extra time to sort through things and get rid of what I shouldn't, so that's why everything is still accumulated from years ago.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). But you're okay with your husband going through your stuff and disposing of things?
Participant 014:
No, I'm not letting him dispose of it until I approve of the disposal.
Interviewer:
Okay, okay. So have you ever gone to a professional for help?
Participant 014:
No, it's not that bad.
Interviewer:
Okay. So you haven't because you don't think it's to the extent where you need to?
Participant 014:
Right, right.
Interviewer:
Okay. And I know that you mentioned that your husband has done sorting through your things, but what about your other family and friends? How do they feel about your behavior?
Participant 014:
Well, my employees make fun of me a little bit because I don't let them throw things away. I have a business in my home.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay, but nothing, like no conflicts or anything?
Participant 014:
No, no.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 014:
Now, several years ago, my husband did get a guy with a dump truck to clean out the garage and he wouldn't let me help. So they threw away a lot of stuff that I probably wouldn't have let him.
