Participant:
Now that I think is a good one. A few times I was looking for something that should not have been put where it was. When you’re looking for something important, you look and look and look. Then you cause anxiety. Then you start getting angry. Then the people around start feeling your anger and it starts arguments. Like “why’d you put it there, it wasn’t there before.” You know. Yeah that’s the only time it ever got in my way. Because I was careless  and didn’t put something actually where it was supposed to go.
Interviewer:
And then that brings up, so not finding something brings up all the feelings of anxiety. Which just turns into a whole other mess.
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Ok. So I know I asked this earlier, and you said that your husband and brother aren’t really; they don’t really negatively say anything about it. But has it ever upset any of your loved ones?
Participant:
no it doesn’t. Not so much my husband because he still; my husband’s not a hoarder, he just a slob. I’ll tell you what he is, he’s just a slob.
Interviewer:
He’s just a slob?
Participant:
Yeah. He’s not a hoarder.
Interviewer:
Ok.
Participant:
My brother is neat, but he’s just compassionate towards me. But I’ve seen his once is a while like you know, you can’t get through. I remember one time he invited my nephew and his wife and kids and there was nowhere for them to sit and he got kind of upset like god we have nowhere for anyone to sit in this house. And it made me feel bad because I have plastic chairs everywhere. So, I kind of, if I know he’s having someone over, I’ll just gather my stuff up and just dump it somewhere.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant:
UNCLEAR. So yeah, other than that I try not to, I try to make sure that I do wish [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Ok. And has it ever impacted any relationships like romantically or familial? Or like with work?
Participant:
Oh no, no. Nope I’m very good UNCLEAR. No
Interviewer:
Ok. And would you like to change your behavior?
Participant:
You know, I so would. I would love to be able to be that person. My son is like this. He could take a room and put things in its place and never lose one item. He’s one of those people if you haven’t used it in a year, you don’t need it. So that was the only thing. He tried to help me a few times and he goes “mom, you really need this.” So what I did was I just sat away and UNCLEAR. And I did get rid of some stuff, I was really proud.
Interviewer:
Good.
Participant:
But you know. No I mean, I don’t know if I answered your question. I got off track.
Interviewer:
No you’re ok.
