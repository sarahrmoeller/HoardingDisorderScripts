Interviewer: So, um, financial value is important but not the most important thing?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Okay.
When we were talking about your items that are the most precious, would you say it's mostly because of its use to you?
Interviewee:
Yes, but also because it was very, um, intentionally selected.
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee:
So, you know, I, I, you know, I went to Ireland, and I bought, you know, this skein of yarn.
And I went to Northern California, and I bought that skein of yarn.
And, and every year when I go to Florida, I buy, you know, I go to this little shop and I always buy from particular dire.
I mean, those, those skeins of yarn each, for the most part, each have significance to me.
Interviewer: So, they have sentimental value in those.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Okay.
Interviewee:
Some of it, some of it has been, some of it was gifted to me.
Some of it, um, friends had spun or dyed and given it to me.
Now yes, it does have its use, and knitting is probably the thing that keeps me from killing people on a lot of days.
But um, but yes.
And honestly, this has come from, just like clearing out that room during this quarantine.
That I was able to take like a huge bin of the yarns that I wasn't in love with, that had no value to me.
and give them to people who would appreciate them.
Interviewer: Okay, good.
Interviewee:
And I, and I did that.
That was, that was sort of my— it was, it was hard.
But it was, it was one of those things where okay, I'm done.
Now what I have left— which is, I mean, you would be horrified.
But most people who, who, you know, participate in these, these arts, you know, this is pretty standard— is to have these bins full of yarns.
Um… you know, but everything in there now that I can go in and I can say ooh I love that one, let me make a sweater, or let me make somebody's birthday present from this, or whatever.
And not digging through going where’s the good stuff?
Because right now it's all good stuff.
Interviewer: So, if you had to choose between your items, in this case maybe like a few yarns that you have, how would you choose between them?
Interviewee:
As to what I gave away?
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee:
Um… I guess I would choose between them based on, you know, when I, when I look at it, when I hold it, when I feel it, does it make me happy?
Interviewer: Okay.
