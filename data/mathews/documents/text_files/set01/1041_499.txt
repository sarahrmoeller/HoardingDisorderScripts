Participant 041:
Now I don't because I feel like I have it under better control and I'm still honestly working on getting rid of more things in my room that I don't use, like giving them away to people because I want to make better habits.
I'm not always going to live with my family, so it's under much better control because with a move, you get rid of a lot of things that you don't need.
My mom was like, "You don't need all this stuff," and I really didn't.
So it was just conceptualizing, "What do I need and what don't I need?" It's much better now.
Since the move, I've been sorting through and using what I have versus shopping for new things all the time.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you ever gone to professional help for this behavior?
Participant 041:
Well, mostly with depression, but it's been both.
It helped me with that, so yes.
I have,
Interviewer:
Okay.
How did you find that person?
Participant 041:
Through counseling?
You know, you talk to a therapist and they suggest different tools.
It was through a healthcare provider.
I told them the issues that I was having and then they referred me to therapy.
It's different in Maryland; they give you certain people you can go to and then you find who you would like to go to, and that's what I did.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How do your family and friends feel about your behavior?
Have you ever had conflicts with them about it?
Participant 041:
With my mom, yeah, because she's like, "You don't need all this stuff."
Sometimes she just would come in and just clean my room for me.
I mean it would look nice, but you want to do that yourself.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How about friends?
Participant 041:
No. I mean it's like a two-edged sword.
The stuff that I have is all things that are practical.
A lot of the things that I had, it utilized the room, but no. No one's ever said, "Oh Participant 041, you look a mess" or anything like that because I don't look a mess.
People wouldn't [INAUDIBLE], "Oh, you just have a lot of stuff," but besides having a lot of stuff, it's never caused conflict, which is always, when I lived on campus, people would always come into my room and want to touch everything, but as for conflict and stuff, besides home and just getting rid of a lot of things that I don't use, no.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So you said right now that you live back home with your family.
What does the space look like?
