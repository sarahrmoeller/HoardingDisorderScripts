Interviewer:
Okay, so as you know, this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.
So the first question I'd like to ask you is what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Interviewee:
The first thing that came to mind was disorganized or disorganization.
Interviewer:
Like disorganized?
Okay.
Interviewee:
Because I know I'm not a hoarder, but I just never get around to finishing stuff.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
Interviewee:
And every room is full of unfinished stuff and things.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
Interviewee:
I guess I don't care.
Use hoarding.
I don't use that, but that'll be okay.
Interviewer:
Okay, we can just go with problems with disorganization, that's fine.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay, that's a great list.
Thank you.
So now we're going to be moving on to the next part of our interview that's a little more conversational.
The first section that we're going to be talking about is your behavior and treatment seeking.
Could you please describe your problems with clutter for me?
Interviewee:
Essentially, I'm a very neat, organized person, and that's how I lived my life until I was 70 years old.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
Interviewee:
And my life's work was being a librarian in large research hospitals and in a college environment.
Those are highly organized places, and I functioned every day by organizing ideas, items, things.
I'm just stunned and shocked that I could move from having lived my life up to age 70 and to have changed so much by age 74.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE Okay.
Interviewee:
I think what comes to mind immediately is my financial difference.
I'm living on about a fourth of what I made when I was working in my later years.
That's because I didn't understand money and didn't save enough money.
I spent money on things that I wanted, clothes, toys, art supplies, those kinds of things.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So you've been saying that this has been happening for the past four years?
Interviewee:
Correct.
Interviewer:
Okay, and how severe would you say this behavior is now compared to four years ago?
Has it gotten better or worse?
Interviewee:
It's much worse.
Interviewer:
Okay, and is that because of you being on a budget and having less financial income?
Interviewee:
Yes, because if i had that income, I could higher people to clean.
I could even higher people to organize, because I would rather do anything else at this point.
I'd rather read, or lay in the yard, or play with my art supplies, or go out and see friends, so forth, but I feel trapped by the lack of money.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
No way out of this.
Interviewer:
Is there a lack of motivation to do it yourself?
Interviewee:
I'm overwhelmed at this point, because I don't even know where to start.
Interviewer:
Okay.
