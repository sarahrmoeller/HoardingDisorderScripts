Participant 37:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What does hoarding disorder look like in your opinion?
How is it the same or different from your own behavior?
Participant 37:
Repeat that, please.
Interviewer:
How is hoarding disorder the same or different from your own behavior?
Participant 37:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
Like what it looks like.
Participant 37:
Well I certainly have in the past bought more than I needed of something so that's one of the things that sticks in my mind.
In terms of collecting I guess if I buy more records than I can play or more than one copy of one I think that that's kind of hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
I don't know if I have-
Interviewer:
So usefulness and just amount of time possible to use all the stuff?
Participant 37:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you believe there is a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant 37:
There's a good question.
Only if you were looking at their shopping cart, maybe.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
Although not necessarily, depends on what they're buying but that would be the only way.
I guess we were talking about things, books, which I did mention earlier in our call.
Interviewer:
Right, yeah.
Okay.
Where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Do you read about it or watch TV shows?
Participant 37:
No, I don't watch, I think there is a show about hoarding.
Interviewer:
Yes, it's on TLC.
Participant 37:
No I haven't seen that show.
You know, I think if... I guess if I were more afflicted I might not be able to recognize it as easily and if I didn't see it in my mother in recent years I don't know how or where I'd be.
I don't know if I've really... you know I hear about neighbors.
There was a neighbor that had stacks of newspaper type of thing.
So, yeah my mother.
Interviewer:
Yeah, so you definitely experienced it as a child so you heard about it then.
Participant 37:
Well as a child...
She wasn't as bad when I was child.
I don't if my father had anything to do with it but after he died, and he died when I was 24, so my mother lived alone for 35 INAUDIBLE years and I think she didn't have anyone to keep her in check.
I wasn't bothering her and so she went about her business and she was happy I guess.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Participant 37:
I guess I think a little bit about whatever level of problem I have and I think of my mother.
Interviewer:
Right, okay.
Now we're going to move into a section about distress and interference.
Participant 37:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
So, does your behavior and your hoarding upset you?
