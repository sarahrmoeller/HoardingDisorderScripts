Interviewer : Okay. And, in terms of like media and television, do you ever get any information about hoarding disorder from there?
Participant:
We don’t use much television or social media, but in my work I have a colleague who’s a clean-up specialist and he actually will rarely come onto a job if the owner’s still alive.
It’s just easier with work if he doesn’t have a living client, and he’s relayed to me one time where the person was so distressed at the prospect of seeing that stuff removed that the day before the removal was to occur there was a self-initiated housefire.
Interviewer : Wow.
Participant:
And it was obviously upsetting for all of us.
It was more than that client could deal with.
COLLEAGUE_[NAME]’s got a sensitive sight of those things where he’ll basically agree to work with heirs or after everyone’s gone.
Interviewer : Right.
So, you consider, you know, that sort of reaction vastly different from what your own might be, right?
Participant:
I’m not planning on burning down the place, yeah.
Interviewer : Right.
Okay, so, where do you get information about hoarding disorder, if you do at all?
Participant:
I’ve heard about, well I follow a fair about, just about behavioral health, um, cognitive health.
Um, my late mom was an Alzheimer’s patient.
I identified fix issues with myself, and so when they would cover Monty’s book about the hungry ghost and acquisition, whether you’re a junkie or a therapeutic shopper, there’s similar characteristics.
It appears to me that there are similar characteristics to those of us who like to self-medicate and others who shop recreationally.
[INAUDIBLE] try to put them in the same folder.
Interviewer : So, it kinda sounds like the information you get about hoarding disorder comes from other like somewhat unrelated aspects of your life.
Would you say that’s correct?
Participant:
I guess I haven’t mentally filed another place for other addiction behaviors
Interviewer : Okay.
Participant:
That’s proven with a pint of Ben & Jerry’s or a bottle of scotch or buying new sweaters.
I think there’s a similar dopamine— well, you know, in recovery I’m trying to find a new, safer dopamine substitute.
Interviewer : So, for you hoarding is kind of like a side effect of other issues in your life?
Participant:
I think so.
Interviewer : Okay.
So, when you hear the words hoarding disorder, do you have any negative connotations associated with it?
Participant:
Um… this will sound inconsistent, but you’ll be able to see how I am trying to be consistent.
In the same way as other addictions, it’s— I don’t see it as a moral failing, I see it as an element of behavioral health.
Some people run low on serotonin.
Some people have got something else that is this kind of pleasure, and so they get their pleasure either in collecting records or collecting sweaters or— like me.
Interviewer : Right.
So, for you a desire to change these behaviors is more so a desire to cope with these feelings?
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
That was the whole idea behind getting sober.
I was an addict.
I tried that.
Found out what parts worked for me well, what parts didn’t work for me very well.
I’m trying this other way, and there are these parts of it that work and there are other parts that are still a work in progress.
Interviewer : Right.
Okay so, that’s all the questions I have with regards to the hoarding.
I just have a couple of demographic questions left, and then some information I need to collect so that we can pay you.
Alright?
[Personal demographic info…]
Interviewer : Well if you have anymore questions, I am happy to answer them.
But that is all I have for today.
I want to thank you so much for participating.
Participant:
Thank you for everything.
Interviewer : No problem, and I hope you have a great day.
