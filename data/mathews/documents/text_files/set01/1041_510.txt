Participant 041:
No, it's fine. It was the same boyfriend. I think we were close to breaking up and I was trying to get him to go to therapy, but he was like, "Oh, well that's good for you but I don't trust therapists."
Interviewer:
Oh.
Participant 041:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. So then yes, a negative impact then.
Participant 041:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. So besides family and romantic relationships, have your clutter problems ever affected your work or school, I guess, since you said that you went to college and you're a nursing student now, right?
Participant 041:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So I wasn't able to focus because it was just too much stuff going on in my room to focus. I mean I started submitting work late, and that's not good. Yeah, that wasn't good.
Interviewer:
So it caused a lot of distractions for you and your schoolwork and stuff.
Participant 041:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 041:
Yes. I think something, just how I was storing stuff, it was just a mess, but things are a whole lot better. I'm grateful for the move to Florida, so yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. It sounds like this move was good for you and you've figured out-
Participant 041:
Yeah, it was good for everybody. My grandpa's happy, my mom is happy, my brother is happy. My mom got promoted, so we moved back to Florida with her. I was like, "Yeah," because Maryland wasn't going to be a forever home. It was just to see how it was and I came back here, and we've been doing it pretty good ever since, and right before all of this craziness happened too, so it was the right timing.
Interviewer:
Yeah. I can't imagine moving right now. That'd be not good.
Participant 041:
Mm-mmm (negative).
Interviewer:
So the last question I have would be, would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items? I know you're actively trying to sort some out, but let's say it wasn't you actively trying to get rid of [inaudible 00:45:13] someone else forcing you. Would that really upset you?
Participant 041:
Yeah. I mean I already had to do that. It did upset me because it's not my house, but what can I do about it? So I'm like, "Okay." You might as well just get over it and keep it going.
Interviewer:
Do you-
Participant 041:
I mean, go ahead.
