Interviewer:
But over time, it kind of got out of control because you would get things from other people and that you would not get rid of it.
And then you get more.
Interviewee:
That's right.
You got it.
Interviewer:
How is it now?
What is your clutter problem like now?
Interviewee:
Well, my problem is that I can't get, I have a two car garage and can't get a third of a car in it.
It's piled up.
I have a bedroom who's piled up with stuff that I kind of wind through and I have a corner of the living room, which has got too much stuff in it and let's see, yes, anything that's a closet or a cabinet is kind of filled.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Okay.
So pretty much all of your storage space is filled up.
Interviewee:
Correct.
Interviewer:
And there are little corners of your house that are used for storage.
Interviewee:
Correct.
In my computer room, well, you can walk into it and get to the computer, but that's about it.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So, your computer room is kind of the place that has the most clutter.
Interviewee:
Mm.
No. Has the most clutter?
No, no. I would say the most clutter is in the garage.
Well, of course the garage is a big space because it's a two car garage.
Then the third bedroom in the house is just about as cluttered as it is, space-wise.
Then the computer room would come next.
The bedroom has some stuff in it, but it's very livable.
And the kitchen, I keep pretty good as far as clutter.
I mean, keeping it out.
I mean the cupboards and drawers are cluttered with a lot of stuff.
And because of the virus, I have cleaned out a little bit there because now I have to stay home and cook.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So the virus has actually given you time to organize it, you might not have had.
Interviewee:
Well, just the kitchen.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Would you say that you'd be able-
Interviewee:
My patio, oh, I have a patio too, out in the backyard and half of it, about a third of it has clutter in it, that doesn't move, but it's patio-type clutter.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Would you say that your behavior is a problem right now?
Do you consider it to be something that is a problem in your life?
Interviewee:
Would I consider what is your problem?
Interviewer:
Your clutter.
Do you do find it to be a problem?
Interviewee:
Oh yes.
It's been a problem for umpteen years.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.
So you see it as something that you'd like to change?
