I see beautiful things and I want them to be around me. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so it sounds like pottery, and sentimental items, and beautiful things. 
Participant 16:
And jewelry, sterling silver jewelry. I used to buy my jewelry primarily at arts and crafts shows or stores.
I like handmade things. I like knowing the person who made them and knowing their style and appreciating their style and their work.
Interviewer:
Okay, and are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they were intended to be used?
Participant 16:
Say that again.
Interviewer:
Are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they were intended to be use? For example, some people use their bathtub as storage.
Participant 16:
No, that only room is that room I described to you, the bedroom that's totally filled with clothes and book sand stuff.
Interviewer:
And then the rest of the rooms just have papers on a lot of the surroundings?
Participant 16:
Well, my smallest bedroom used to be my study where all my books were, then it became my computer room and I would work from home on my computer a lot at night and on weekends.
Right now, it's primarily arts and crafts supplies and furniture for those supplies. And I have a four drawer filing case. I have a folding table behind the door. I have a big steel easel for painting behind the door and then I have stacks of paper and boxes full of paper. There's a stack of magazines to tear pictures out of and a stack of old books that I could do book art in.
Interviewer:
How important are your things for you to feel at home?
Participant 16:
Very important. I could never be a person who lived out of hotels, primarily. I could never be a person who changed homes frequently.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative) 
Participant 16:
I like to be surrounded by the things I like and enjoy.
Interviewer:
Okay, so it's very important for you to have your objects with you?
Participant 16:
Yes, yes. 
Interviewer:
And what is trash for you? What do you throw away?
Participant 16:
All of the unwanted mail I get. I have a huge bag beside my carport door where I come in with my mail and I immediately get rid of stuff and tear my address off stuff and shred that.
What was the question again? What do I consider...
Interviewer:
Trash.
Participant 16:
Trash?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative) 
Participant 16:
Primarily paper I don't want and things from cooking and in the kitchen.
Interviewer:
Okay. And this goes back to your most valuable items, so you're jewelry, your pottery, your art supplies, what would happen if you lost those?
Participant 16:
Well, I think that immediately I would feel profoundly sad and overwhelmed.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
