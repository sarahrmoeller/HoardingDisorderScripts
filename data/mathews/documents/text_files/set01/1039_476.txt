Interviewer:
Gotcha. Okay. I'm going to read one more.
John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.
He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.
He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.
Antiques occupy every room.
Before entering his bathroom he must remove several antique items.
Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.
He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
Do you think that this person has hoarding?
Participant 039:
Yeah.
I do.
It doesn't make any difference really whether you buy things and hoard them or whether you collect free things.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 039:
If you collect things that you don't use even though you think they are of value, it's hoarding as far as I'm concerned.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Collecting a lot of things, especially things that you value whether or not it has some, maybe to some it has value, to others it doesn't but if you place a value on it and you have a lot of those items, then that's-
Participant 039:
Yeah.
If you were to ask me to give a definition of hoarding part of that would be that it is items that have, may or may not have value but you, yourself, don't use them.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 039:
I think that is absolutely essential to a definition of hoarding.
It's not something that you need or use, but mainly it's the using part of it, the definition that's the key.
Interviewer:
So having a lot of items-
Participant 039:
That's what makes the whole thing absolutely ridiculous.
That's what differentiates us people, us hoarders from other people in that we have all these items but we don't use them.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
So it's like even though those things could be of value to someone, you have so many items that it's at the point where things don't even get used?
Participant 039:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
That's a great definition.
Thank you for that.
This last part actually asks about COVID and how it's impacted your life.
Participant 039:
Can I go back just a little bit.
Interviewer:
Oh, sure.
No worries.
Participant 039:
I really think that you should revise your story.
I think having the business about him looking for his keys that he either can't and usually he can't find them right away.
I really think that's immaterial.
I think that's a distraction.
Interviewer:
Okay.
