Participant 039:
Yeah. But I never ever made much money so that didn't last too long.
Some of these outlets started, like Sierra Trading Post, that would send you a catalog of shoes that were, what do they call them, seconds?
Sometimes these seconds are seconds only because the lot happened to have a lot in them that were not as perfect but yet you end up... I have some shoes that I got from Sierra Trading Post as a second that have lasted me forever.
They've never worn out.
I'm not a person that's hard on shoes so I can wear a...
In fact, I've got on a pair of shoes, pair of ECCO training shoes or what do you call them, the British call them trainers, but anyway, their not tennis shoes either.
You know, recreational type shoe.
Interviewer:
Sure.
So you got pairs of shoes-
Participant 039:
I bought these shoes six years ago and I'm still wearing them.
There not in the best of shape but I'm still wearing them.
I'm not hard on shoes.
I started buying a lot of these seconds and sometimes I would go into T.J.
Maxx and would find them and I would buy them.
Well, recently I have started to get rid of them.
Most of them I never wore.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So now you're starting to get rid of your shoes.
Okay, what makes your possessions valuable?
It seems like you really value these shoes, what makes them more valuable than other items?
How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
Participant 039:
Well, I just don't differentiate.
It's just something will occur to me that I like.
For instance, I started wearing bow ties about three, four years ago.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 039:
And I found a particular model or brand of bow ties on Amazon and I bought every bow tie this particular company sold.
I haven't even worn some of them.
My excuse now is that I hardly ever go any place.
When I lead a book club and so forth, when I would actually go out I would wear my bow tie.
Interviewer:
And so you really like bow ties, as well?
Participant 039:
Some of these things just tickle my fancy.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 039:
And when I started losing a lot of weight I decided, well, instead of wearing a belt I'll wear suspenders, so I went through a binge of buying suspenders.
Interviewer:
So you kind of get hooked on maybe items of fashion or something like that and you start collecting a lot of them.
Participant 039:
Yeah.
It's not particularly fashion driven, it's just that it's something that I think I want for a practical reason, like instead of the belt I wear suspenders.
I can't satisfy myself with just buying one or two, I have to buy as many as my budget will allow.
