And a couple of times, I wasn't feeling quite right.
I was feeling like pent up, if you know what I mean?
So I watched a sad movie, and that helped me have a little cry, to release that tension.
So those are the other things I've done for myself during this, to deal with it.
Interviewer:
You're giving me some coping strategies.
Participant 29:
Good.
You're a young person, I gather.
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 29:
I recommend keeping a gratitude journal, if you've never tried it.
You just write five things that you're grateful for and sometimes if you can't think of them, it's just taking a breath.
But over the long-term, there's actually some scientific evidence that keeping a gratitude journal as a huge impact.
I did it when I was younger.
I don't even feel I need to do it anymore, because when I'm in that mood.
I can tell myself, "Okay, list some things you're grateful for."
But it's not a bad habit if you have time, it can be really quick and it's just for you.
And it could either be first thing in the morning, or it can be last thing at night.
Just write five things a day you're grateful for.
Interviewer:
I'll definitely try that.
Thank you for suggesting that.
Participant 29:
You're welcome.
Interviewer:
I always love the life lesson I learn from those that have just a little bit more life experience.
Participant 29:
That's very sweet to hear.
Yeah, that's really nice.
Interviewer:
Okay, so this brings us to the end of the interview.
The only questions I have left are questions, demographic stuff, and then your address so that we can send you your gift card.
Participant 29:
I already have a card.
You want to send me another one?
You don't just add money to it?
Interviewer:
If you'd like to give me your email address, we could potentially do it through that.
Participant 29:
Well, just send me the new card.
That'll be fine.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So could I have your physical mailing address?
Participant 29:
Yes, it's 1980 Quail Hollow Drive.
Land 32720.
Interviewer:
32720?
Participant 29:
Correct.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And your first and last name.
Participant 29:
Participant 29.
Interviewer:
Okay, and then your email address?
Participant 29:
Okay it's pfleming10@icloud.com.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And then you have the preference for the physical card, rather than online emailed electronic gift card.
Participant 29:
I think so.
Interviewer:
Are you sure?
Participant 29:
No. But, I don't know what would make me sure.
It's like, "Okay, I'm not going anywhere."
How do you use the online card?
Let me ask that.
Interviewer:
Usually whenever you check out at any sort of website, they'll have a space for a gift card code, and you enter in a code.
Participant 29:
Okay.
Like I said, I've only ordered two things online.
Interviewer:
We'll send you the card then.
