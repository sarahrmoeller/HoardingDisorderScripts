Interviewer:
Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Okay. So last story for you. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and he knows they're valuable. So he goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried that he might get rid of an antique that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom he must remove several antique items. Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he's looking for. He is almost always late in getting where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all. So in your opinion, do you think this person have-
Participant 1:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Clutter problems again?
Participant 1:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 1:
Yeah. Well, clutter. Yeah. Clutter. Because it's ridiculous. He has so many antiques that they impede his behavior and cause problems in his life.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Is this behavior similar or different to that of your own in your opinion?
Participant 1:
Different.
Interviewer:
And why would you say that?
Participant 1:
Because I'm not late to my meetings and I mean it's the same in that I collect clothes like that. I may collect ... but they're in my closet. And I put my keys in one spot. I mean, that's why I do it. Because I have a spot so I don't lose them. And there's just certain things you got to be careful of and they're major things. The keys are major to get you out of the house and get you out the door.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Of course.
Participant 1:
So yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Participant 1:
I mean, you would think that one episode of 30 minutes trying to find keys would cure that problem. The person would be like, I got a problem.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). You would definitely think so. Yeah.
Participant 1:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. Perfect. So that's the end of the stories. So we're going to go ... this last part of the interview is about COVID-19 and again, I'll just be asking you questions again. So again, any clarification please feel free to ask me. If you're uncomfortable answering any of the questions, just let me know. Absolutely no problem.
Participant 1:
Okay.
