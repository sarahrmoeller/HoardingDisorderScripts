Interviewee44:
But it wasn't like I intently watched it either.
It's like, okay, I'm leaving.
Interviewer:
I understand.
Yeah.
Anywhere else?
Maybe internet or books or any of that sort?
Interviewee44:
I haven't looked it up on the internet.
I'm sure I must have read articles about it if I came across one I suppose.
But some reason I don't think it would be interesting to me.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I understand.
And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee44:
It sounds greedy.
It sounds a little deranged.
It's not a good thing.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So, just thinking about your issues and difficulties with collecting treasures, does your behavior upset you?
Interviewee44:
Makes me feel good when I'm doing it.
But then it's just more obligations stacking up.
Because I've got disperse with, do something useful with or return it, which doesn't easily happen.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, it feels good when you're keeping your items but maybe looking at everything from an outsider backwards picture it just seems like more of an obligation, more to deal with.
Interviewee44:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Can you describe a time where your behavior has gotten in the way of something that you really wanted?
Interviewee44:
Yes.
I've got a lot of paperwork to file, some legal things, that I know I had all ready to go and I cannot find it.
And I don't know if it's in one of these boxes and my daughter-in-law tried to help me by putting everything in boxes, just put everything in a box add to the pile to make it a little cleaner in here or not.
I don't know.
I just haven't come across it yet.
Interviewer:
So, it's getting in the way of some of that legal paperwork because it's gotten lost.
Interviewee44:
Yeah, I know there's things that I have worked on and that I can't find.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
I know you mentioned that your behavior is upsetting to your son and he might be mad at you right now, which I'm sorry about.
Do you think it's ever impacted any other family or romantic relationships?
Interviewee44:
I don't know.
Interviewer:
So, would you just say it's mostly impacted your relationship with your son?
Interviewee44:
Yes.
Interviewer:
What about work?
Interviewee44:
I don't work anymore.
Interviewer:
Would you say before, when you were working, it affected it in any way?
Interviewee44:
I don't think I was terribly organized.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Would you like to change your behavior?
Why or why not?
Interviewee44:
I would be more comfortable if it were changed.
Why?
It would be less messy.
It would be less dangerous.
It would be more socially acceptable.
And it would simplify, which as we all hear now, simplifying makes you feel better.
