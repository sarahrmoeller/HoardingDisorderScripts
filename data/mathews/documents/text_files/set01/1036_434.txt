Participant 036:
Okay. No, that's all [INAUDIBLE] said [INAUDIBLE] although it's valuable for help for my care of that stuff and it is valuable on the ranch to have this stuff.
Where I am it's not valuable to [INAUDIBLE], it's a hanker.
Interviewer:
So where you grew up it was actually an asset to be able to save stuff and then have it when you need it, but then when you kind of, moved out of that environment it stopped being helpful for you.
Participant 036:
Exactly.
Exactly.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you were even able to identify your uncle when you didn't know where he was by the fact that his yard looked just like your father's yard.
Do you want to get that?
Should I hang on while you get the phone?
Participant 036:
Okay, thank you, I've got two phones here actually...Hello?
[INAUDIBLE] completely hung up [INAUDIBLE].
I'm sorry.
I lost track of where we were in the conversation.
Interviewer:
Yeah, so you were explaining to me that this was a problem that you've had your whole life, but it isn't really a problem for you.
It is more that you-
Participant 036:
CROSSTALK That's why it's problem, right?
It's a problem if it's situationally dependent [INAUDIBLE] it.
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
I'm sorry, Participant 036.
I'm hearing this echo on our call.
Could you maybe move the phone-
Participant 036:
CROSSTALK get that away from my truck.
Is it better now?
Interviewer:
Yeah, that's much better, thank you.
Participant 036:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So you've experienced this kind of thing your whole life, when did it start to become a problem in your life?
Participant 036:
Well, I bought a house in Golden, Colorado I had a wife.
Interviewer:
Uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 036:
And, she was the one that started to bring her own stuff.
I brought five washing machines, abandoned washing machines to bring them home to take to the motors out, and stuff like that.
My wife brought it up to me and said, "this is not normal."
Interviewer:
So it was really your wife that first made you feel like it was a problem because you were bringing home all these washing machines.
How many washing machines do you think you brought home?
Participant 036:
Well, we brought home two and I kept trying to untiL she got done talking to me, I didn't dare bring home any more.
Interviewer:
I understand that.
So she nipped it in the bud for you there.
Participant 036:
Till this day, I want to strip all the plastic off appliances and stuff.
You never know when you might need a small screw.
Unfortunately you can't find a small screw in the three dollar coffee can full of small screws, depends what you're looking for.
So it's not very practical what I recognized.
So I stifled myself and I don't do it anymore but [INAUDIBLE].
