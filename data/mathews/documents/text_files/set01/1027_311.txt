Interviewer:
That's cool. 
Participant 27:
My son... That family have not been to my house in 13 years, even though they only live an hour and a half away. I'm invited to their house, but they don't come to my house. The other dynamic of that is their dad and I got divorced after 43 years of marriage. I have a live-in boyfriend, so I'm thinking that that is the reason because they came to my house before I had this boyfriend. I'm thinking that is the reason that it is, but I do know that my kids don't approve of this. However, I have told them and in my will, it says, "They don't even need to come into the house if they don't want to." If they want to come into the house and go through each room and pick out what they want to keep, that's fine. If not, they call. 
It's an exclusive auction house that sells vintage things. They've sold things for me before. They call that number. He's been right through my house. He knows what I have. He comes through and takes what he wants and then they call another auctioneer that does estate sales and he comes in and he sells it either right from the property or takes it to his place and sell it. My kids don't have to do a thing. 
Interviewer:
Gotcha. 
Participant 27:
Including selling the house. That auctioneer will sell the house as well. I feel like what I am doing, I am doing for myself. If I die, in a half a day, everything can be gone. 
Interviewer:
It sounds like this is really something that your children and their spouses don't necessarily like, but it's something that you're doing for yourself and you've tried to make arrangements so that it's taken care of down the road. 
Participant 27:
Right. 
Interviewer:
Since we were talking about your house a little bit, I know you mentioned that you're getting an extension on that house and that you have quite a bit of space. Can you just describe where you live now and what the space is like?
