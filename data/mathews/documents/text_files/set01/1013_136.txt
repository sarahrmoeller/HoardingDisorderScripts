So as you know, this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having a hoarding disorder.
The first question would be what term would you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 013:
What term?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 013:
I'm not sure I understand the question.

Oh. Interviewer:
Difficulties with clutter.
But it's up to you.
It's whatever you prefer.
Participant 013:
Oh, yeah, I don't care.
I mean I always call myself a pack rat.
Interviewer:
So would you prefer pack rat?
Or would you like me to refer it as hoarding?
Or?
