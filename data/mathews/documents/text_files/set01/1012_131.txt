Interviewee:
Okay. What is the most precious item in your house for you?
Why is that one valuable?
Interviewee:
The most precious?
I can't say that there's any one particular because I have so many I like.
My most precious possessions are my family and my cat.
As far as items are concerned, they all have value to me in one way or another.
You know, if we had a fire and we were running out and I had to grab one thing, other than the computer and my phone and the cat, there isn't probably one in particular that I would grab above anything else.
Interviewee:
No singular thing is coming to your mind beside your computer and your phone and your cat?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
No.
No. Not in any of the collections because I like them all pretty equally.
There's not one item above others.
That includes pictures, paintings and other things too that we have.
Interviewee:
Is there one collection that you value more than another?
Interviewee:
There may be pieces of each collection, like in the nesting dolls.
There's one set that is highly valuable, in a sense, to me, because of its ornateness, how it was made, and there's one or two in my other collections that I have a lot of different collections so they're specific.
Actually, I guess I have to take that back.
I have a pair of handmade dolls from Hungary that were made in the war and made by somebody who has the same name as my mom.
Those are sentimentally quite valuable to me.
I think those would be the thing I would grab before anything else.
Which collection of things?
It depends on my mood.
I'm constantly changing.
Yeah.
What would be my favorite collection right now would change in a few minutes.
Interviewee:
Okay.
What would happen if you lost those dolls that you said are really valuable to you?
Interviewee:
What would happen?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Like how would you feel?
Interviewee:
I don't know how to ...
All I can relate to is when my cousin, their house burned down and they lost a lot of things that were valuable to them, one of which was a Japanese doll.
I mean, it was a family heirloom and all of us mourned over that one but you get over it.
There's nothing you can do about it so you have to move on.
It'd be depressing but if I lost it, it'd be because there was a whole lot of other things being lost too.
It'd be painful.
It'd be very painful.
