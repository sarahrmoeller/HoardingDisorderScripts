Participant 48:
I see a therapist. I've been seeing her for like five years. The hoarding is a side issue. And there was a time when she wanted to focus on that. And she sort of suggested that she could get a social worker to come in and mirror me, double for me, keep me on focus, and clean it up that way. I was very resistant to that idea, because it's embarrassing. And I don't want to explain, "This is important to me because, and this is why I want to keep it," to somebody who also looked at it and sees no value objectively. So I changed. I also take [inaudible 00:25:06] and Bupropion every day.
Interviewer:
Okay, so how did you find-
Participant 48:
And I read books about ADD, hoarding, and try to keep up with the latest on the issue, mental health wise. 
Interviewer:
That's great. How did you find your therapist?
Participant 48:
I was in a program where, a jobs program, and that's when they learned about traumatic brain injury history. And that was the first time, it was like 10 years ago, and that was the first time that I ever got any specific [inaudible 00:25:50] for it at all. Even after being in a coma for five days and [inaudible 00:26:02] when I was 17.
Interviewer:
Okay. So you're seeing your therapist, you're taking some medication, you're staying up to date on what's going on in the mental health world, yeah. And I know you mentioned-
Participant 48:
And I'm always cleaning. I'm always actively repairing the problem, and I don't really make much progress. 
Interviewer:
That must be difficult.
Participant 48:
The thing is, I'm still optimistic. I still think that I can do it in two weeks. [crosstalk 00:26:26]-
Interviewer:
Hey, optimism is great.
Participant 48:
Yeah, but I totally believe that in two weeks [inaudible 00:26:34] will be the day that I will get into focus and start realizing that I have this space, and I know what I want this space to look like, and all the stuff that's in this space that is not where I want the space to look like, has to go. Has to go. Has to go. But piece by piece it's a lot harder.
Interviewer:
Understand. So I know you mentioned before that your behavior's kind of upset your roommate, even though she kind of deals with some issues with hoarding as well. And then you also mentioned prior that there's this kind of scurry when you find that there's going to be an inspection to clean up some things.
Participant 48:
Yeah. Always. I try-
Interviewer:
Yeah. How do your other family or friends or landlords, any of that, feel about your behavior? And have there ever been any conflicts?
