Interviewer:
Okay. Now we're going to move on to a different section.
I'm going to read you some short scenes and you're going to tell me if this person should try to change their behaviors if the behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist or is the behavior is similar or different to yours.
And I can repeat these questions at the end of every scenario.
We can start with our first one.
John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in.
He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no other boxes in other rooms.
His house is not always organized, but usually is not cluttered.
Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.
Okay.
Do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee:
Yeah, probably.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How come?
Interviewee:
Because, he maybe is fixing to fill that entire closet with a bunch of boxes.
That's just a little bit neurotic I'd say.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think that this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
I don't think you say it requires treatment.
He could probably talk to a psychologist even and understand why he's doing it and get over it.
But I don't think it's required.
I'm sure he could live perfectly normal with closet full of boxes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Would you say that this behavior's similar or different to yours?
Interviewee:
It's different from mine.
Interviewer:
Okay.
In what way?
Interviewee:
I don't collect things like empty boxes or old magazines or newspapers or anything like that.
The only thing I collect is things like music CDs and movies that I really, really like that I've liked all my life.
My favorite movies.
Then I do collect celebrity biography books.
But I don't have an extensive collection.
I just have a shelf full.
Interviewer:
You would take less things that are more of use to you, compared to this scenario?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I mean, there's things that I can actually probably steal if I wanted to.
