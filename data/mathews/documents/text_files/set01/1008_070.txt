Interviewer:
Wow. What was that like for you to finally throw it out?
Interviewee:
Certainly stressful, and it was, I guess, I felt very guilty about never finishing it.
Yeah, every time you see it, which is not very often, but I would kind of feel a little twinge for throwing it out because I had a lot more emotion I tied to it.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Interviewee:
But I think now that it's gone I'll probably never think about this again, hopefully.
Interviewer:
And how does that feel?
Cause here you are struggling with it, right, thinking about it being in the trash.
But now it's gone.
How ... I guess this is ... I have a couple questions there.
How long was that period, that now it's gone you won't think of it?
And how does that feel to kind of think about how you won't be thinking about it again?
Interviewee:
I'm looking forward to not thinking about it, maybe not feeling guilty, but it has certainly been, for what is basically just a pile of paper and a couple note books, I've thought about it way more than I want this week.
That's for sure.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Of course, you're going to ...
Interviewee:
I don't know if I'm answering your questions.
Interviewer:
No. Yeah, it's just I think we ruminate over these things, and then now it's gone, and you might not even think about it.
I think having that insight can help facilitate more discarding of stuff.
Interviewee:
Yeah, and I probably have, a little bit unique in the sense of seeing my dad with it, that I've been aware that it's an issue since I was young.
And, you know, I can see what happens if it runs unchecked and what a burden that can be just for him and then for people around him too.
So, in my case, people around me, and I don't want that to be a burden for other people.
But its helped me, I guess, keep it from being out of control, but I think all the same, emotions are there.
Interviewer:
And what other emotions do you think you said?
Guilt?
Are there other emotions that are pretty related to your problems with hoarding?
Interviewee:
That's probably the biggest one.
Just kind of haven't thought of this before, but loneliness.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
Actually.
I think there's some comfort having stuff around.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Maybe the people are gone, but the stuff is still there.
Interviewer:
Totally.
Yeah.
Sometimes we can ...
Kind of like a memento or something.
Right?
We replace that.
Interviewee:
Yeah, exactly.
