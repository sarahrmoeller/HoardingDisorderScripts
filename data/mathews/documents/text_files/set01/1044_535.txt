Interviewer:
Are there any items in the bathtub or in the sinks or in the room?
Participant 44:
Both of the sinks got some stuff in it, like Listerine bottles and a couple of things in the sink that can come out.
There wasn't really any place to put them.
Both from my husband's stuff leftover.
Interviewer:
Right, so you feel like, other than the bathrooms, all the other rooms are pretty cluttered?
Participant 44:
Yes.
Oh yeah, there's a hallway too.
Stuff is lining the hallway.
Interviewer:
And what makes them cluttered?
Participant 44:
Boxes of stuff, piles of stuff.
Boxes on top of boxes.
Interviewer:
So, I know you mentioned prior that you've saved a lot of paperwork and clothes.
Are those what's in those boxes or are those separate from what's in the boxes?
Participant 44:
No, that's in some of them, some of each.
There's a bunch of Christmas and even Halloween stuff in there.
Interviewer:
So, holiday décor.
And how important are your things for you to feel at home?
And out of those items, what do you feel are the most important to you?
Participant 44:
In the whole house?
Interviewer:
Yeah, anywhere.
So, basically out of all your items in the house, how important are your things for you to feel like you're at home with your things?
And out of your items, what do you say are the most important to you?
Participant 44:
Okay.
There's a big carved mantle.
There's a huge mirror hanging around the cape.
There's an old piano in there but I don't know, it's really old.
I don't play it.
Interviewer:
So, do you think if those things weren't in the home, it wouldn't feel like your home?
Do you feel like those things are necessary for you to feel at home in your house?
Participant 44:
Those things are necessary because they've been there for 150 years.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, they're important due to their-
Participant 44:
They're family.
Interviewer:
Their family value but you wouldn't say you necessarily spend a lot of time with them.
Participant 44:
Correct.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What items in your house do you spend a lot of time with would you say?
Participant 44:
I'd rather be outside.
Well, I've been watching COVID-19 on the television.
The dining room, I've turned it into an office.
I spend time there.
A little time in the kitchen.
Sleep in the bedroom, that's all I do in there.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you know your necessary items in the kitchen, your bedroom, your television, but you wouldn't say that the other items that are piled and the stuff in the boxes aren't really things you spend a lot of time with.
Participant 44:
Well, they're just things that need to be distributed sometimes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What would you like your home to look like?
