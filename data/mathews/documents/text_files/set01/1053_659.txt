Participant:
I just consume a lot of information, so I’m confident, you know, that I know that I have the best information and then adhering to best practices. I don’t know. That’s the only thing tahat comes to mind. 
33:55 Interviewer:
Okay. No, that's great. And where do you seek comfort, like from your items? Or from others?
Participant:
The dogs. Or doing... You know, especially my husband has been baking. So there's a lot of cooking and baking that goes on. There’s some remodeling in the basement that’s kind of fun to plan how we're going to arrange things and so that that's been going on.
34:41 Interviewer:
Okay, so baking and remodeling just to keep your mind off things maybe?
Participant:
Yep. 
34:51 Interviewer:
And have you sought treatment or resources or some other kind of professional support during the pandemic?
Participant:
I have, yes, but that's not as a result of the pandemic. I’ve been, you know, doing this for some time now.
35:08 Interviewer:
Okay, so just other than the pandemic, you've sought out resources.
Participant:
Yeah. 
35:15 Interviewer:
Okay, and has the pandemic affected your motivation to seek help for your problems with clutter specifically?
Participant:
I think there’s no difference there. 
35:30 Interviewer:
Okay. Have the people or the person living with you changed during the pandemic or it's only been your husband, correct? And your dogs. 
Participant:
Yep. 
35:50 Interviewer:
So how have you kept in contact with family and friends during this time? 
Participant:
Well, I’ve used zoom, you know, zoom meetings. Just the usual stuff. I have a sister in another city and we texted and emails and stuff like that.
36:09 Interviewer:
Have you ever felt socially isolated or lonely prior to the COVID-19 pandemic?
Participant:
Yes, yes. 
36:20 Interviewer:
And has the pandemic affected this sense of loneliness?
Participant:
Not really. 
36:28 Interviewer:
So it’s about the same then?
Participant:
Yes, about the same. 
36:33 Interviewer:
Okay, um, my last question is, have you ever experienced conflict during the pandemic with anyone? 
Participant:
No, nothing notable comes to mind.
36:53 Interviewer:
Okay, well that's good to hear.
Participant:
Someone came over to visit, and he didn't tell us before he got here that he’s been in another state where there was, you know, worse infection rates than where we are now, and I was annoyed with him, but I didn't like say anything to him, but I, you know, I felt an internal displeasure with the guy and I would think twice before I had him over again. But that's, I mean that's the extent of it.
36:32 Interviewer:
No, but that's understandable, especially at this time. You know, it's hard. People should be disclosing that I agree. So that was actually my last question of the interview, so thank you so much. I'm just going to ask you a couple of demographic questions. So what is your gender identity? 
Participant:
Female.
38:01 Interviewer:
Your sex assigned at birth?
