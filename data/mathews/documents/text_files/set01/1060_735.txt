Participant:
No, my daughter. And the therapist labeled her as a hoarder. This was oh my god about 10 years ago. So that’s when her depression got really bad. And I just never really heard UNCLEAR . About ten years ago. Hoarders and I used the logic I was like oh my god such pigs. But then I look at me and go NAME such a pig. You know? But at least I didn’t have the garbage. I felt lucky. And you can open my front door, because at my daughter’s you can’t. Man, you could not. She had to crawl over. Just imagine. Oh yeah
Interviewer:
And what do you think about when you hear the words “hoarding disorder”?
Participant:
you’re breaking up.
Interviewer:
Can you hear me?
Participant:
Ok so you’re breaking up, so I don’t know if it’s you or…
Interviewer:
Ummm
Participant:
Now you’re ok.
Interviewer:
Ok good.  What do you think about when you hear the words “hoarding disorder”?
Participant:
UNCLEAR . And I don’t consider myself mental. I really don’t. I’m not depressed. I used to have major anxiety but it’s kind of controlled now. I’m a very happy person, really, I am. So mentally ill. That’s it.
Interviewer:
Ok.
Participant:
I used to think pig. You know, trashy people. I used to think that before my own daughter became one. And I knew she wasn’t. And I knew where it came from.
Interviewer:
So it was that personal connection that changed your insight.
Participant:
Yeah. Other than that I was like “oh my god you slob.” So that changed real quick.
Interviewer:
Ok. And now we are moving into the last section of our interview which talks about distress and interference of hoarding disorder that will have in your daily life. So does your hoarding disorder upset you? Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant:
Ugh. Not per say get in my way. No, it doesn’t. It just causes anxiety sometimes because I’ll wake up sometimes and “oh my god, what a mess.” I love… I was raised in a clean house.  And it’s you know, my mother, my mother would fall over if she saw this. UNCLEAR. I’m sorry about that, I keep, I keep making you think it’s really bad but it’s not really. I don’t know I don’t have an answer to that.
Interviewer:
So you don’t, you wouldn’t say that it gets in the way of your daily life.
Participant:
No because my other rooms are fine.
Interviewer:
Ok.
Participant:
My yard’s fine. My porch is fine.
Interviewer:
Could you think of a time where your hoarding disorder got in the way of something you wanted?
