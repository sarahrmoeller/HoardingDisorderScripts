Interviewer:
This one Mr. John Doe has several books that he keeps in case he needs to use in the future.
Books occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom.
Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.
Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.
Participant 33:
Sounds like a clutter problem, bordering on hoarding disorder I guess.
I don't know.
Books in the bathtub seems kind of crazy to me.
Yes.
I guess that's INAUDIBLE for a hoarding disorder, but it sounds like it's on a whole milder level.
Interviewer:
So milder hoarding disorder or borderline?
Not as severe as the one just before this?
Participant 33:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Similar to the questions that I asked before, should this person try to seek change or try to change their behavior?
Participant 33:
Yes.
Interviewer:
If you were in their shoes, would you decide to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?
Participant 33:
I don't think so.
It sounds like the situation could be manageable.
I don't know.
I guess if you tried to seek change and you couldn't, then you should probably see a professional.
Interviewer:
You would probably see how much that you could work on changing that behavior before?
Participant 33:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Reaching out.
Okay.
Is this similar or different to your clutter problems in any way?
Participant 33:
I've certainly spent 10 or 20 minutes looking for an item I use routinely.
I try to have special places for the important things.
I think I've been doing better at that.
It's not something I've really been keeping track of.
It sounds like... I mean I definitely don't have to remove anything from the bathtub before I take a shower though.
Sounds like maybe he's a little bit worse than me.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So there's some similarities and some differences?
Participant 33:
I'd be upset if I was this guy, but I don't think I'm quite as bad.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
The 10 to 20 minutes maybe looking for items that kind of relates or you can see some comparisons there, but you don't have to take things out of the bathtub in order to take a shower?
Participant 33:
Right.
