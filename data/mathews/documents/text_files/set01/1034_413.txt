Participant 34:
Yes. That's right.
But we have it in abundance if we're INAUDIBLE spending our time.
Interviewer:
I want to talk to you more about how quarantine and COVID have impacted your views of your items and starting to maybe get, work through organizing and discarding.
First I want to ask you, does your behavior of collecting items and not really discarding, does that upset you at all or does it get in the way of every day life?
Participant 34:
It does to some degree because it limits my mobility.
It's a major thing to move my library.
I now have three bedrooms of bedroom furniture.
So I'll have to think in terms of a sale or yard sale or whatever before I move next, which I think, what I'm trying to do the next couple of months.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
You'll have your work cut out for you.
Has your keeping items ever gotten in the way of romantic or family relationships?
Participant 34:
I don't think so.
No. Interviewer:
That's often another reason that people will list is, whenever they talk about why keeping items might be distressing is, they will mention the mobility concern as well as who will clean it up after they're gone, potentially.
But then also, a lot of people are distressed because they're external pressure is from other people asking them, why do you do this or wanting them to get rid of items.
Participant 34:
Right.
Or wanting to know, do you have a plan for when you're gone?
I feel unprepared.
Like I was working on my doctoral dissertation forever.
I never did finish it because, it was on Jacque Rousseau, 18th century Swiss philosopher of some note.
So I have a library that is INAUDIBLE for books by or about Rousseau and his philosophy.
Interviewer:
You kind of CROSSTALK-
Participant 34:
I haven't found a scholar or university or something to see if they would like to be in line to either inherit or purchase this library for students and scholars to use.
I've got all his works in French and English and most of the major secondary works and works about him since the '60s.
Interviewer:
You have so many items that are so valuable and such a diverse...
Participant 34:
Yeah, I'm a specialist.
It's a specialty kind of library.
I have a couple of autographed books like one by Kurt Vonnegut.
Interviewer:
Which one?
Participant 34:
Oh dear, which one is it?
I have his works.
I'm from Indianapolis.
And that was his hometown as well.
In fact, I lived about six blocks from his house, but some years after he lived there.
And I didn't realize it at the time.
Interviewer:
That's so interesting.
Participant 34:
I'm going to check which book it is.
I'm just having a brain fart INAUDIBLE.
Hocus Pocus.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I haven't read that one.
Participant 34:
You haven't read that one?
