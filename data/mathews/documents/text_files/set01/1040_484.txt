Interviewer:
Severe.
Participant 040:
Severe.
Well, the one thing I don't do is food.
Food goes out.
Food goes in the trash or the garbage.
You won't find...
Well, occasionally a candy wrapper, non-sugar, sugar-less.
But then it's handy that I can... I put a trash can at each end of the sofa, and there's a trash can in every room in the house.
So when something needs to be thrown away, I don't have to look for a trash can.
May sound weird, but I [INAUDIBLE] on, is one end of the loveseat.
The other end is a mess.
Let's see.
What's the question?
Interviewer:
How severe would you say that overall clutter problems or hoarding disorder for you is now?
Participant 040:
Well, compared to some of those things where there's old bodies and animals running around and whatever, I would say mine is moderate.
Interviewer:
Moderate.
Okay.
Participant 040:
Pardon?
Interviewer:
I was going to say, do you believe that it's an issue or it's a problem, your clutter problems?
Participant 040:
Oh, definitely.
Interviewer:
And I know you mentioned that some of it is kind of some issues with space and you mentioned the back room.
Are there any reasons-
Participant 040:
Oh, and the original sewing room that I sort of outlined for myself when we first moved into the house.
There are aisles of about 12 inches in a circle around the boxes, which go up about four feet in a configuration and it has fabric in it.
Interviewer:
Is there any other...
Oh, sorry.
Participant 040:
Go ahead.
Interviewer:
Is there any other reason for why clutter problem, clutter issues, I'm sorry, are a problem in your life?
Participant 040:
Why they're a problem?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Outside of what you mentioned with space and with these aisles and your relationship with your husband.
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Well, I can generally find, generally find whatever I'm looking for.
I don't have to go out tools and [INAUDIBLE] piece of fabric.
I can generally find it.
It may take me a while.
I use what I call the Herod method: go and search diligently.
I don't know what anyone else does it, but that's my religious background.
Are you familiar with the story?
Interviewer:
Of...
Participant 040:
The wise men came and asked the king, and the king said, "Go search diligently for the young child that I may worship him also."
Interviewer:
Yes.
I thought you had said Herod; I just wasn't entirely sure.
But yes, I am familiar with that story.
Participant 040:
Okay.
But the King James Bible and many Bibles up to a certain point use the word diligently.
So I will search diligently.
Interviewer:
Searching diligently for things.
