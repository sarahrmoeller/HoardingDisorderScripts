Interviewee:
And especially, if more of the answers were to be that he can't find his keys because of clutter, then it would be more appropriate, but since most of the answers, at least the way I answered them, feel that it's hoarding.
It's a hoarding behavior and not a clutter behavior, then it's even more obvious to me it's hoarding because his not being able to find the keys isn't a matter of moving the boxes out of the shower for instance, because you normally wouldn't keep your keys or lose your keys in the shower anyway.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I don't really think that's a very good part of the story.
I could see throwing something else in there but keys are not one of them.
Interviewer:
Because you think that folks tend to be pretty good about remembering their keys?
Interviewee:
Not that they tend to be good about, a lot of people can't remember where they put the keys, but it's usually, it just has to do with memory and with putting the keys down in a place that they normally don't put them, therefore, they don't remember.
They usually, people that I have known that can't find their keys, in fact, I have a friend right now who just day before yesterday called me and said, "Interviewee, I can't come because I can't find my keys."
Her house is practically bare, she hoards absolutely has no hoarding tendency or clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Right.
You're saying that it's not exclusive to people that hoard so maybe a different item would be good.
Okay.
I'll definitely note that.
Thank you for that perspective.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I would definitely come up with something else because keys is just not appropriate.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Good idea.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
This last section is going to ask you about COVID.
How has COVID impacted your life?
What has changed for you since COVID started?
Interviewee:
Absolutely nothing.
Interviewer:
Oh, really?
Interviewee:
I'm writing a novel and I spend too many days, I should take a day off and just relax in the garden if nothing else or start getting rid of all the crap that I have.
I have actually started to do a little bit, but it really hasn't impacted me because I'm not a social person.
Occasionally, [NAME]e and I would go out to a restaurant to eat, but now we can order out and go pick up food at these restaurants and I just as soon eat at home anyway.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Interviewee:
It really hasn't impacted me at all.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
In fact, I kind of have to remind myself.
In fact, I went to take my dog up to have her groomed this morning and I forgot to put my mask on.
