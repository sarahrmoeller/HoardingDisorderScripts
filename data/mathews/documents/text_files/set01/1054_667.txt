Interviewee:
Well, I have a similar plastic bin in my bed.
Um, I have um, two closets.
Oh, the other thing I'm kind of crazy about is purses.
Interviewer: Purses, gotcha.
Interviewee:
Oh yeah, purses are a big one.
That’s a major one.
But, you know what I was getting their blessing, but with the stores being closed I can't go in and buy things, so, I'm actually paying on my cards.
Interviewer: Okay.
Interviewee:
So, that's a positive thing.
Yeah, I do like purses, I like wallets.
Uh, you know, whether I need it or not, it’s selling.
That’s the way it is.
Interviewer: Right.
So, you know, from an outside perspective, would you say someone might think you had an excessive amount of clothes, or an excessive amount of purses or wallets?
Interviewee:
Oh, yes.
Yes, definitely.
Interviewer: Okay.
And so, where you keep these?
Interviewee:
Um, I have uh, purses in— I have a smaller closet in my bedroom, and I’ve got a larger one.
They’re on the shelves.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
And are they organized, or would you say they're more cluttered?
Interviewee:
Definitely the wallets and stuff are definitely cluttered.
The purses I, I actually spent an hour just trying to figure out how to put them somewhere based on size, and how they need to stand up and stuff like that.
But that took me an hour right now.
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee:
But there's a lot I never even touched, you know?
Interviewer: Okay.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer: So, ideally, you like to have these organized when you can?
Interviewee:
Yes, I would love to be organized.
I love to be able to get my hands on things.
And uh, yeah, yep.
So, it would be very important to me.
Interviewer: Going off that, what would you ideally like your home to look like?
Interviewee:
It would, uh… I would love it clutter-free.
Interviewer: Mhmm.
Interviewee:
Where I could get to my IMAUDIBLE.
My bedrooms are dusted.
Nothing on the floors.
Interviewer: Mhmm.
Interviewee:
You know, just, just being able to see my wood drawers would be so nice.
See that stuff.
Interviewer: Right.
So, it sounds like there's a lot of stuff now, like on the floor and kind of like blocking the way of maybe getting to some of the furniture.
Is that what I'm hearing?
Interviewee:
Um, it is getting better.
I have managed to, to do some stuff.
But, what I found myself doing, but when you're also through with it, I’m putting it on the darn bed.
Interviewer: Mhmm.
Interviewee:
So, that's making it worse, and then I have to unload half the stuff back in my bed at night, you know?
Isn’t that horrible?
Interviewer: Mhmm.
No, I understand.
Interviewee:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: So, you know, in comparison with all the rooms in the house, are there any that are, would you say clutter-free?
