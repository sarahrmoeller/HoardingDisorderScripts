Interviewer:
Yeah. Have you needed to seek treatment for anything hoarding ... Well, you said you haven't sought treatment for hoarding, but have you felt the need to because of COVID with anything? Or you're managing it pretty well?
Participant 008:
Managing it pretty well.
Interviewer:
How about your wife? How is she coping with it? 
Participant 008:
She is more social than I am. So, it sure is bothering her more. I don't know that she's doing anything specifically to manage that, I guess. Having ... She's a stay at home mom right now. So, it hasn't impacted her work. She was finishing an internship when it hit. So, there was definitely some stress associated with trying to get that done. She's getting her master's.
Interviewer:
Hmm.
Participant 008:
But now ... And again, for her, it's not being able to see her friends, not being able to ... She wants to do sociable stuff with the kid.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
Participant 008:
Really can't do much of that. Can't do a lot of play dates and things like that.
Interviewer:
Right. It sounds like you guys have creatively come up with some ideas to keep your child entertained, which is great.
Participant 008:
Yeah. Yeah. He's ... He will find something to destroy if nothing else is going on.
Interviewer:
Right. 
Participant 008:
Yeah, I think we worry a little bit that he is not getting socialized. It's just us most of the time or his grandparents. But ...
Interviewer:
Right. Well, it sounds like you're handling that, and you stay in contact with your friends via Zoom, or I'm assuming Zoom or some ...
Participant 008:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
... Some way.
Participant 008:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
And you like ...
Participant 008:
Probably not a lot specifically that we're doing, but ...
Interviewer:
Sure. Any conflict between you and your wife or other things because of COVID or, I don't know, anything that's related? 
Participant 008:
No.
Interviewer:
No. 
Participant 008:
No, not ... I can't think of ... We've not had any fights over anything.
Interviewer:
Sure. Well, that's great. Anything else you'd like to share before we finish up?
Participant 008:
I can't really think of anything, although we're conscientious, this popped up into my head, of thinking about ways to identify a hoarder, or personality traits that associated with ... Sorry for that random thought, but ... My dad was very conscientious with that side of the family. They're all super conscientious. 
Interviewer:
Right, and that's an interesting trait. I feel like kind of what you said with neurosis and stuff like that, kind of that.
Participant 008:
Yeah. Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. Well, that's a great thing to add. Thank you for that. So, now we are done, which is great. I hope you enjoyed this. I definitely did. 
Participant 008:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
It's interesting. 
Participant 008:
Yeah, it's not something that talk about easily with anybody.
Interviewer:
Right.
