Interviewee50:
No. Some of the things that I get are you know how people look at info marshals, and they buy all the exercise equipment?
And it's not that they're going to use it, but they're buying it for the lifestyle that they see that they want.
Interviewer:
They want to be a person.
Interviewee50:
Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Totally.
They want to be a person that exercises.
Interviewee50:
Yes.
And so the stuff that's in my house has the tendency to be the stuff that how I basically want my life to be like.
My mom is watching this movies, oh yes.
I love me.
And in there she and her husband and she says "I don't know.
I don't think our life is ever going to get started."
And he said to her "ut honey Holly, you're already in your life.
It has already started."
And so I think that I keep waiting for my life to start where everything that I've purchased is going to fall into place the way that I see that it would.
Interviewer:
So it's not so much about your items helping you feel at home.
It's more that you're waiting to be a person who will use them.
Interviewee50:
Yes.
Good job.
Interviewer:
I'm trying to get better at it.
I want to make sure I'm not putting words in your mouth.
Interviewee50:
No, you're doing good.
You're doing good.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So what are the items in your home that you feel like you spend the most time with, or that you use the most, you engage with the most?
Interviewee50:
Obviously my DVDs, my television and my microwave.
Interviewer:
So most of the stuff that you have, you don't actively engage with?
It's mostly that you watch TV [CROSSTALK].
Interviewee50:
Except for getting dressed for work and stuff, trying to find something that looks appropriate or that I just didn't roll over.
Which a lot of times I do just roll over and just go.
Interviewer:
So do you wear the clothes that you have in your home?
Do you go through them to wear them or are they mostly just being stored?
Interviewee50:
Oh yeah, definitely go through to find.
I feel like every other thing well.
Every other single female adults do and look for things that are clean and I don't have to iron that I could just throw on because I want to sleep a little bit longer instead of doing something to prepare to get dressed.
So, yeah.
So I do wear my stuff and I do go through to find what to wear, it's just that sometimes things get on top of each other and then I forget that I had, and I go, "Oh, I forgot I owned that.
Oh, I'm going to wear that thing."
Like that.
