Participant:
A lot of old papers, which I generally have to do that every year for income taxes, going through papers and stuff. And that’s not as hard as going through things like piles of clothes. So what I try to trash is stuff that’s old, meaning that you can’t use it anymore, things that I’m not using anymore. And not everything gets trashed because some things we give to, like there’s a local Goodwill type of thing, you know, so if there’s like clothes or other things that people can use, we gather those together periodically and bring those to that local place. But otherwise it’s paperwork, clothes that I’m not using or don’t fit… 
22:08 Interviewer:
So things that you just can’t use anymore, that would be trash. 
Participant:
Yeah. 22:14 Interviewer:
Okay. 2
Participant:
There’s a lot of potential trash here too, that I’m not going through. 
22:20 Interviewer:
You haven’t gone through it yet, so… 
Participant:
Like old various cords for old various computers I don’t have anymore and all that kind of stuff. I have a whole, you know, those red ice buckets, those big ones- I have one full of that crap! 22:39 Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay, and what would you say is the most precious item in your house? 
Participant:
Well aside from the people in it and my puppy dog.. Precious, the most precious item in my house… just one?! 22:59 Interviewer:
If you can choose one. 2Participant:
The photos. 23:01 Interviewer:
The photos? 
Participant:
Yeah, and included in photos are like videos and movies we take too. 23:09 Interviewer:
Just the things that capture the memories.
2Participant:
Yes. 
23:15 Interviewer:
Do you think you have too much stuff? I know that you mentioned the clutter, it’s a lot, but how do you know you have too much stuff? 
Participant:
Well because kind of the house is overflowing with it, like, you know, even in terms of [23:33] INCOHERENT closet, and I hate going through that, but I guess I’m going to have to go through that again too because it’s like all these old medicines and things, but anyway there’s not even enough room to put towels in there and sheets, and sometimes they overflow out here and… 
23:57 Interviewer:
So it’s an organizational and space issue. 
Participant:
Yes, yes. 24:02 Interviewer:
That’s how you know you have too much stuff. 
Participant:
Yes. 
24:05 Interviewer:
Okay. So now I’m just going to ask you a couple questions about distinguishing hoarding disorder. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder? 
Participant:
Well collecting is more of an organized activity, where you know everything you have, you kind of may have lists of it, and you store them together in an orderly fashion.
