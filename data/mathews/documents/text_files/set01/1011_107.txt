Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 011:
Yes.
Interviewer:
So as you know, the study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question would be, what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 011:
What terms are you offering me?
Interviewer:
It could be any terms that you feel comfortable with. It can be either hoarding disorder, or just clutter, or anything you prefer.
Participant 011:
Yeah, I've always called it clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay. Okay. So thank you for creating those lists for me. And the next part of the interview is more of a conversation. So I will ask you questions for you to answer and feel free to ask questions if you need any clarification.
Participant 011:
All right.
Interviewer:
All right. And if any questions make you uncomfortable, just let me know and you don't need to answer them.
Participant 011:
Okay. That's good, nothing makes me uncomfortable anymore. But when I think about all the clutter and try to explain it to myself, sometimes it does make me feel a little uncomfortable.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah. I understand. So first question is, can you please describe your clutter and how long has this been going on?
Participant 011:
Well, I mainly, at this point, I'm a paper clutterer. It's been going on for maybe 50 years out of my 81 years. So since I was about 30, maybe even younger, I'm trying to think though when I was in my twenties. No, I liked to have a clean house when I was in my twenties.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 011:
Didn't want to have anything. Yeah. So I was about 30 years old when I started gathering the dust around me.
Interviewer:
Yeah. How severe would you say that this behavior is now?
Participant 011:
It's pretty darn severe. I remember when I was a young man, I walked into some old guy's house and he had saved every newspaper in his life. You couldn't even move in his house. He had like pathways around newspapers that were all bound up and they went from floor to ceiling. And I don't get that far. Sometimes it gets up to my knees around papers. And I just mean, I don't save newspapers or clippings anymore. I used to, but I don't do that. But I do have a tendency to put things on the kitchen sink and things like that. Hello?
Interviewer:
Yes. Hi, that's me.
