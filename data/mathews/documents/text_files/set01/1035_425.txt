Participant 035:
It takes up the master bedroom to the point that I cannot open a closet door. Let's see. The kitchen, again, it's just messy. I've got stuff on the counters. Everything from small appliances like a crock pot that I need to just go put back on its shelf, to ... Oh gosh, I tried Nutrisystem for a while, so I still have some of that stuff sitting out. In the den where I spend most of my time, oh God, I've got one, two, three dog beds, four dog beds in here. Yeah, four dog beds, and one chair is covered with clothes. Then, the breakfast table has been covered with beading stuff, because, my jewelry making stuff, for a couple of years, because I've been reorganizing it, and can't get that finished and can't quit buying either. 
That's that situation. Guest bedroom and front office are so crowded that I just shut the doors on them. 
Interviewer:
It sounds like the place you spend most of the time right now is your den. 
Participant 035:
Yeah. It is. 
Interviewer:
That's cluttered, but it has your stuff out on the table. 
Participant 035:
Right. 
Interviewer:
How does it make you feel to be in that space? Do you enjoy looking over your beading supplies for instance, or your stuff, or does it stress you out?
Participant 035:
No. All of this stresses me out. That's the really perverse part of it, that I know that if I cleaned it up, and eliminated the clutter, I would feel less stressed, and less guilt about, instead of sitting here watching this, you're playing this computer game, you could be up there getting rid of this, and cleaning up that, and you'd feel better. 
Interviewer:
You feel like if it was less cluttered, you would enjoy the space more, and you would feel-
Participant 035:
Oh, Lord yes. Yeah. 
Interviewer:
What would you like your home to look like ideally? What would you get rid of, what would the space ... How much stuff would you have? Would it be all away and organized, or would it not be present in your home at all?
Participant 035:
The excess stuff that I'm realistically not using, won't use, would be gone. My kitchen would be, right now, I've enjoyed cooking in the past, doing family dinners and that kind of thing, back in the day. Right now, I've got so much clutter in the kitchen, that it's difficult to work in, because I have to move things around to make space, so that I can prepare meals, dadadadada. 
I would have a much more normal, regular way of doing. I don't think I'll ever be super neat, but if you can sit in all the spaces that I have, and the living room looks pretty, it's a lived-in space, but it's a welcoming space.
