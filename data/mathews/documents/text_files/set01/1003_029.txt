Interviewer:
Okay. Then the next vignette is, John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they're valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.
So again, does this person's behavior seem more like hoarding disorder, or is it more like clutter problems, and why?
Participant  004:
That definitely [inaudible 00:22:35] it doesn't sound [inaudible 00:22:47] so it's probably disordered.
Interviewer:
Okay. Should this person try to change their behavior?
Participant  004:
[inaudible 00:23:04] probably.
Interviewer:
Okay. And does this behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant  004:
Probably.
Interviewer:
Okay. And is this behavior similar or different to your own, and why?
Participant  004:
It sounds different. [inaudible 00:23:32].
Interviewer:
Okay, so the last part of this interview is about COVID-19. Again, I'll be asking you questions, please let me know if you need any clarification or are uncomfortable answering any of the questions.
Participant  004:
Sure.
Interviewer:
All right. So how has COVID-19 impacted your life?
Participant  004:
I used to go down to the [inaudible 00:23:54] two or three times a week [inaudible 00:24:05].
Interviewer:
Yeah. Have any specific behaviors changed?
Participant  004:
Probably. (silence) not really, no. [inaudible 00:24:29] more time with... I guess some different times [inaudible 00:24:36] on Facebook. I'm not [inaudible 00:24:41].
Interviewer:
Okay. How has COVID-19 affected your acquiring habits such as buying things or acquiring free things?
Participant  004:
I don't really buy [inaudible 00:24:50] get loads of free stuff, I do get [inaudible 00:24:50] actual stuff that takes up space.
Interviewer:
Okay. And has COVID-19 affected your difficulties with throwing away things?
Participant  004:
[inaudible 00:25:28] yeah, sometimes [inaudible 00:25:46] in a day and [inaudible 00:25:46] so kind of I guess, it's kind of helped. More packaging [inaudible 00:25:49].
Interviewer:
Yeah. And how has it affected problems with clutter?
Participant  004:
It's really about the same. [inaudible 00:26:05] too many boxes to [inaudible 00:26:08].
Interviewer:
Okay. And has COVID-19 affected your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items?
Participant  004:
I don't think so.
Interviewer:
Okay. And have you had more time to organize or declutter your space?
Participant  004:
I've had more time but I haven't used it.
Interviewer:
Okay. And then how has COVID-19 impacted your overall physical health?
Participant  004:
I don't know if anything's changed all that much.
Interviewer:
Okay. And has it affected your overall mental health or wellbeing?
Participant  004:
I don't think so.
