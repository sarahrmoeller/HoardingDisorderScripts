Interviewer:
Okay. Then the next vignette is, John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they're valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.
So again, does this person's behavior seem more like hoarding disorder, or is it more like clutter problems, and why?

Interviewer:

Interviewer:
Okay. And has COVID-19 affected your difficulties with throwing away things?

Interviewee:
It's really about the same. [INAUDIBLE] too many boxes to [INAUDIBLE].
