Interviewer:
Oh, okay. Did it ever affect your relationship with your children? Did they adopt this behavior as well?
Participant 022:
No. My kids are the total opposite. This is my theory is that when you grow up and you have everything that you want, you don't value things. There was maybe three things or something that I think my son told me he wanted. He put a colored sticky note on it for when I die that this is his. My daughter, absolutely nothing, she wants nothing at all. She did take a teapot recently that was my mother-in-law's and I was so shocked that she took it. We have a hot tub and I'm trying to give it to her, "I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it." She doesn't want anything. She really does not it. She rents a house. She doesn't want anything permanent. She's the total opposite of me and my son is like that too. They just don't want things. They don't value things the way I do or my husband does.
Interviewer:
Okay. You mentioned that you had multiple sisters. You had four sisters, right?
Participant 022:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Were your parents like this at all? Do any of your sisters have this behavior?
Participant 022:
That's interesting to think about. I think one sister has it little bit. She buys stuff and she can't find it or she's so disorganized that she has to buy it again and again and again. I don't know if that's necessarily hoarding as much as it is just having a messy life. Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 022:
I think all of us probably buy too much, all five of us, but I think I'm probably the worst by a long shot. I have the disposable income that they don't have too. I think that's part of it.
Interviewer:
Okay. Did your parents also save a lot?
Participant 022:
No, no. My mom was an alcoholic, so there wasn't a value put on anything.
Interviewer:
Okay. How about your husband? Did any of his family members save a lot also?
Participant 022:
His mom. His mom was really, really a saver. Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 022:
I think it was nine dumpsters when I cleaned her house out when she went in the nursing home.
Interviewer:
Oh wow.
Participant 022:
Oh, yeah, yeah. Unbelievable. They lived in the house for 50 years. She saved every Good Housekeeping magazine.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Participant 022:
Oh, I know. Behind the couch, behind the couch.
Interviewer:
How difficult was that for you and your husband when you had to help his mother clean? I guess she didn't really help. But was that difficult to get rid of those items?
Participant 022:
No. It really was pretty easy actually because it wasn't mine. Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
