Interviewee32:
Well, I think of somebody who's just obsessive about a certain object and who compulsively collects, purchases, or however comes by that object...
Let's see...
To the point of it interfering with healthy normal living in their living space.
Interviewer:
Okay, so when it starts to interfere with their daily life is when you could consider it hoarding?
Interviewee32:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, for the next couple questions, I'm going to read you a situation and then I'm going to ask you if you think this person exhibits more hoarding disorder tendencies or more just clutter problems.
Interviewee32:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.
He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms.
His house is not always organized but is usually not cluttered.
Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.
So, do you think this person depicts more hoarding disorder or more clutter problem behavior?
Interviewee32:
Clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee32:
No, I don't think it sounded like it was a problem other than just not remembering where he put his car keys or glasses or whatever it was you said that he had to look for.
It didn't sound very bad to me, yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, then you would think that this behavior does not require treatment from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee32:
Yes, correct.
Interviewer:
Okay, and is this behavior similar or different to your own?
Interviewee32:
Oh, it's similar to mine, but yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, how do you see similarities?
