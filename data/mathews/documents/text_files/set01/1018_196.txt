Interviewer:
So, you would have an easier time getting organized if there was a place that you could drop things off?
Interviewee:
Yeah, if there was more things available.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like what's stopping you from getting organized is not having enough space in your apartment, or is it not having enough time in your day, or is it your anxiety?
Interviewee:
Well, there's not having enough space or not having enough money to move to a bigger space.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, if you had a bigger space, then that would be helpful in helping you get organized?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So, does this problem upset you?
Does it make you feel upset when you think about it?
Interviewee:
Yeah, not being able to find a place that's affordable in a safe area.
Interviewer:
Does the problem of having too much stuff upset you?
Interviewee:
Yeah, but I would feel better if I could have the space to get it all organized.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you feel like right now having all of this stuff is getting in the way of your life?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
In what way?
Interviewee:
Well, the financial burden of having too much rent or...
Interviewer:
Having to pay all that money for storage space is getting in the way?
Interviewee:
And also, still being overwhelmed with...
Interviewer:
The process?
Interviewee:
... figuring out what to do with certain things.
Interviewer:
Is there a time that you can remember when all of this stuff got in the way of something that you wanted or something that you wanted to do, or got in the way of your life at all?
Interviewee:
I don't know.
Interviewer:
Does it impact your relationships, your friendships, or romantic relationships, or relationships with family?
Interviewee:
Well, I often would rather stay at home to go through things.
Interviewer:
So, you'd rather stay at home and go through things as opposed to going out and meeting people or going out with friends?
Interviewee:
But I do go out and meet with friends anyway.
Interviewer:
So, sometimes you do that anyway.
Interviewee:
Now, when I do, then this becomes out of sight, out of mind.
Interviewer:
So, once you're out of your apartment, you no longer think about your stuff, and you just enjoy being out with your friends?
Interviewee:
Well, no. I still think about it.
It's just that I'm not spending time.
Interviewer:
You're not spending time on it?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Is this behavior of saving so much, is this something that you'd like to change?
Interviewee:
Well, I guess, but I still need to go through everything.
