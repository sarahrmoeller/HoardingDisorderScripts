Interviewer:
So, you would have an easier time getting organized if there was a place that you could drop things off?
Participant 018:
Yeah, if there was more things available.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like what's stopping you from getting organized is not having enough space in your apartment, or is it not having enough time in your day, or is it your anxiety?
Participant 018:
Well, there's not having enough space or not having enough money to move to a bigger space.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, if you had a bigger space, then that would be helpful in helping you get organized?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So, does this problem upset you? Does it make you feel upset when you think about it?
Participant 018:
Yeah, not being able to find a place that's affordable in a safe area.
Interviewer:
Does the problem of having too much stuff upset you?
Participant 018:
Yeah, but I would feel better if I could have the space to get it all organized.
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you feel like right now having all of this stuff is getting in the way of your life?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
In what way?
Participant 018:
Well, the financial burden of having too much rent or...
Interviewer:
Having to pay all that money for storage space is getting in the way?
Participant 018:
And also, still being overwhelmed with...
Interviewer:
The process?
Participant 018:
... figuring out what to do with certain things.
Interviewer:
Is there a time that you can remember when all of this stuff got in the way of something that you wanted or something that you wanted to do, or got in the way of your life at all?
Participant 018:
I don't know.
Interviewer:
Does it impact your relationships, your friendships, or romantic relationships, or relationships with family?
Participant 018:
Well, I often would rather stay at home to go through things.
Interviewer:
So, you'd rather stay at home and go through things as opposed to going out and meeting people or going out with friends?
Participant 018:
But I do go out and meet with friends anyway.
Interviewer:
So, sometimes you do that anyway.
Participant 018:
Now, when I do, then this becomes out of sight, out of mind.
Interviewer:
So, once you're out of your apartment, you no longer think about your stuff, and you just enjoy being out with your friends?
Participant 018:
Well, no. I still think about it. It's just that I'm not spending time.
Interviewer:
You're not spending time on it?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Is this behavior of saving so much, is this something that you'd like to change?
Participant 018:
Well, I guess, but I still need to go through everything.
