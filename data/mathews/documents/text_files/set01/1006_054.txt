Participant 006:
If I can't use it, and it's machinery or something, yeah, I'd be happy to pass it along. I have a collection right now of vintage linens. A huge collection of handmade linen doilies and bedspreads and tablecloths. I don't need them. My kids don't want them. To them, they're just old fashioned. But I cannot let go of them. I don't know what it is. I just have this hard time letting go.
Interviewer:
Yeah, no, it makes sense. Especially with something that, did you make those doilies?
Participant 006:
No, no. The things that my grandmother made and passed to me, I've kept and I've labeled them for my kids. But anytime I go to an estate sale or a yard sale or anything and there's vintage handmade things, I snap them up because I think, I don't want them to be thrown away or discarded, some people put a lot of time and effort into that.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 006:
Even though I have no use for it. I do use some things. But I can't possibly use everything I have.
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 006:
Really, I basically have come to the realization that I just need to avoid any place where I might be tempted to bring things home. If I don't see it, I won't do it. This is completely off topic for you and I'm sorry to interrupt, somebody said to me recently that she doesn't look at home décor magazines or websites or anything because it always gave her a sense that she needed more, or she needed to do something to her home. And I realized that I have spent years looking through magazines, books, and lifestyle TV shows and trying to update my life to go along with that, or things that I want to try in my house. I realize, maybe if I'm not looking at all that stuff all the time, I won't. I'll be satisfied with things the way they are.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah.
Participant 006:
Yeah. I've stopped. I had a few magazine subscriptions that I have let lapse because of that. I'm not taking any kind of magazines anymore at all. Because I was afraid. I thought, perhaps, that it would help me not to be looking to change things all the time. I don't know.
Interviewer:
Yeah, no, that makes sense. It relates to how, obviously COVID is a much bigger scale. But you mentioned that because you're not able to go out, you find yourself buying less things. It sounds like the same thought process applied here. If you're not looking at all these things, then you might not be as prone to getting them or storing them.
Participant 006:
Correct.
Interviewer:
Or just feeling like you need more things.
Participant 006:
Correct. Yeah.
