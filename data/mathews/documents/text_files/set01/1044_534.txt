Interviewer:
What about your husband?
Participant 44:
I think he was fine with it.
Interviewer:
So, he was okay with how your collections of things and things that you were holding on to, he was okay with it? 
Participant 44:
No, he wasn't okay with that. I was talking about the-
Interviewer:
Your change of location for playing dominoes, okay. I see. So, how did he feel about your behavior in general and the condition of your house and everything?
Participant 44:
Well, he didn't like it but he didn't really help that much either. He would clean up an area for himself, he'd put everything in the living room. Okay. 
Interviewer:
Contributing to the issue. Okay, so he didn't like it but you didn't feel that he really helped you either. 
Participant 44:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And have you had any conflicts with anybody or landlords or any of that sort due to your behavior?
Participant 44:
My son doesn't like it. And my daughter's okay with it, she's got the same thing going. 
Interviewer:
So, your son doesn't like it. Do you think there's been any conflicts between you two because of it?
Participant 44:
Well, he tried to help me once and some stuff fell over on top of him. 
Interviewer:
Oh no. 
Participant 44:
And he tries to take care of things, he's really not physically capable of it. He's not that healthy. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so after he doesn't like it but he tried to help out and maybe that situation maybe made him frustrated. So, has there been any other interactions between you two since then?
Participant 44:
Right now he's mad at me. I haven't seen him for a couple weeks. But he could be very busy at work because they're one of those biomedical companies that are working on the COVID testing. 
Interviewer:
Right. Okay. So, you live in a house, correct? 
Participant 44:
I do. I live in my great-grandparents' house. 
Interviewer:
Okay, and you live alone?
Participant 44:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Can you describe what the space is like?
Participant 44:
There's I think a sunroom, there's like a , I've  got a pantry and there's a door, and then there's off of that a combo office and laundry. There's the kitchen, there's a dining room, there's a large living room. There's a family room or bedroom, it could be either. And then there's a bedroom and a bathroom. So, a little bathroom on the other side. 
Interviewer:
And are there parts of your home that you consider to be cluttered? 
Participant 44:
Pretty much everything. The main bathroom's not so bad. Bathrooms aren't too bad. There's a large covered porch on one side that's full of furniture. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And in that main bathroom that you said, it needs a part that isn't available anymore to be repaired. Is it just unused or are there things in that bathroom?
Participant 44:
Oh, there's a bathtub and shower and two sinks.
