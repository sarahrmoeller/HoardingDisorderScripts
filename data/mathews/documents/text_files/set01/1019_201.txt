Interviewer:
People tend to have a cognitive bias towards three, that's interesting.
Let's move into just talking a little bit more naturally about your situation and what's been going on with you around your saving behavior.
So if you could just start by talking me through your saving, what it's like, how long it's been going on, when it started and then how it developed over time.
Interviewee:
I have tried to touch a little bit so far, but I'd say that my perception is that my saving has been a longtime characteristic, probably started with the sense that scarcity or wastefulness is a sin.
As a Boy Scout, I definitely felt like there were values of using things and figuring out to how to use things was a skill to be cultivated.
I also would tend to think if I had an opportunity to get something, like make a collection of records, I would, early on in my adulthood, I would make that collection, but not get to it, but say, "I'll get to it someday, because I know this is a valuable and a wonderful resource."
Classical music of many varieties, and I worked at a record company where I could collect records easily for later use.
Interviewer:
So it started when you were a kid with these values of resourcefulness and saving and not being wasteful, and then as you got older, you started to develop collections of different kinds of things, but the collections would never be ...
Interviewee:
Right, and the element of religion I think was part of this too.
Interviewer:
Okay, can you talk about that and what you mean by it?
Interviewee:
Like I said, it was a sin to be wasteful.
Sin in the sense that God wants you to use what is here responsibly.
That's a value that has continued through my life, I'm constantly thinking of the best way to use the resources of our world and reuse the resources of our world in a responsible way.
Interviewer:
So it really sounds like there's a moral component to you, that it's a moral obligation to responsibly use things and not waste them.
Interviewee:
I think so, yeah.
In fact, one of my great phrases is, "Live simply that others may simply live."
I constantly resonate to that as I repeat it.
Interviewer:
So even though it may seem that you have a lot of stuff, for you, what you're doing is actually being respectful of things, because you're not just discarding them as if they were worthless.
Instead, you're willing to hang onto them because you see the value in saving things and reusing them and being conscientious about them.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Sorry I interrupted your narrative, you were telling me about the record store and how it had changed throughout your life, and I interrupted you.
Interviewee:
But I did make a collection of records and saved it in hopes that someday I would come to appreciate it and to have it release its value and enjoyment in my life, but without really being very realistic about it, because there's not enough time to do all the things I need to do.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
