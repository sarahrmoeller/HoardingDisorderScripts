Participant 28:
I've not collected more things other than a few rusty things I've picked up during walks and stuff, but you know, I'm not going to thrift stores. I haven't been buying supplies for my business, jewelry business, and I like being by myself, so sheltering in place was fine, and eventually I started seeing my friends out on walks and stuff, so how has it affected me? I ended up doing a lot of drawing which was not the first thing I thought I would be doing. I did a lot of doodling and drawing and coloring, and stuff like that. It was sort of meditative and kept me calm, especially when I'm watching the news.
And from all those drawings, I decided to make greeting cards out of them. I made prints of them and made greeting cards, so that's been a big part of the last few months. It's been good mental health wise. I've enjoyed it.
Interviewer:
And have you, like with the extra time, has there been any extra motivation or energy to declutter, or has there been any extra energy for other projects, too?
Participant 28:
No. I think the energy is really low, and I've tried to be really aware of not getting depressed, and having some routine in my life. I do yoga and I've been pretty disciplined about that, at least an hour a day, but generally energy is quite low and I'm not very self-disciplined. I judge myself on that, too, although my friends would say that's not true, I'm really self-disciplined. I'm a harsh critic of myself not getting certain things done.
Interviewer:
That tends to be the case.
Participant 28:
Like decluttering.
Interviewer:
They go hand in hand. Yeah. It sounds like there might be more time in the day, but there isn't necessarily the energy or the motivation, because you mentioned there aren't those deadlines there, too, either, to work towards making more for your business, or being held accountable to any sort of timeline.
Participant 28:
Yeah, you know, I'm just remembering a year ago or so I did a three month coaching session through my job. We got a wellness coach, and we were supposed to make goals at the beginning of the three months, and generally it was supposed to be about physical health, but I chose to make my goals around decluttering for those three months, and I really worked on it with her. I saw her once a week, and I had to say each week what I was going to do, and I did a bunch of stuff.
