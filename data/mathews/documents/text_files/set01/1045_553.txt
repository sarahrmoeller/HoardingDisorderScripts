You've got things from the 70s with things from the 90s and things from a week ago. And then it gets more and more muddled and more and more confused and then I challenge these people to know what's in these piles after 60 years of mixing up the piles. I'm just more professional at messing it up. To use a distortion of the word professional. I'm more effective at it, no that's not the right word either, anyway. More deranged. 
Interviewer:
No, I wouldn't say deranged but you just ... it gets mixed up and then so you don't know what's in your piles anymore. Did it ever cause problems between you and any coworkers?
Participant 45:
Well, to some degree but I had a situation where I could limit that. I've always been a person that's worked pretty independently and I don't know how to work collaboratively very well. The way people work in today's world, I started in a job that was like that. I did educational R&D but then I got out of that and I was ... and even there you could work awfully independently but in today's world everything is collaborative and so I would need a whole new set of skills to be able to do that. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, that's true a lot of it is group work and group thinking. That's a big part of a lot of jobs today. 
Participant 45:
Yeah. And it's the only way to work really, it's much more effective. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. It can be a lot more effective. There are going to be problems but in general it has a lot of good outcomes. So you mentioned that you liked working alone, has that ever impacted your romantic relationships then?
Participant 45:
Yes. I mean, I have a closed door policy here and that's not good (laughs). I have never married. I was an only child for a long time and then shortly after my sister was born I went away to college. And then in college I enjoyed group living actually in college but then I had some roommates in graduate school and stuff and then I started living alone again and I've lived alone all my life after that. So, certainly by the time I was 40 I was completely living alone. 
Interviewer:
Okay. I'm just trying to look over all my questions I have set up and see if we missed anything along the way but I think we've covered everything. 
Participant 45:
So, Interviewer, tell me, you're a graduate student at the University of Florida?
Interviewer:
No, I'm actually an undergrad. 
Participant 45:
Uh-huh (affirmative). And your field is psychology?
Interviewer:
No, actually it's anthropology. 
Participant 45:
Ah, I was an anthro undergrad. Uh-huh (affirmative).
Interviewer:
Oh really?
Participant 45:
Interesting. So-
