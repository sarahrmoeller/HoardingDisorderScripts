Interviewer:
Gotcha.
This is our last one as far as the vignettes go.
In this one, John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.
He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.
He's worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.
Antiques occupy every room.
Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.
Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.
He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.
Participant 33:
Yes, that is definitely a disorder.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Would you say that kind of similar to the other one that you said was definitely hoarding disorder that, yes, he should seek change and that if you were him, you would probably see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?
Participant 33:
Yeah, yeah.
I would say definitely see a psychologist.
That sounds more like a mental thing I guess than just a little disorganization.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I know you've talked about in general you don't like to recommend to others to get psychiatric or psychological help.
Would that be true for this particular person as well or is it bad enough that you would make that recommendation to them?
Participant 33:
Yes.
That's a good question.
It's true.
When things get bad enough, I guess in this case, I probably would make that recommendation.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Again, any similarities or differences with yourself that you see here that are particularly poignant?
Participant 33:
Very slight.
I guess the biggest difference is that I am not a buyer.
I do not buy things unless I need them of course.
My hoarding usually comes from gifts or from just stuff that I somehow inquire.
I don't ever deliberately go out and purchase things.
When I feel like people are starting to financially impact themselves for stuff that is detrimental to them, then that becomes a real serious problem.
Interviewer:
Sounds like there's a real...
Yeah, the financial impact for this person would definitely...
Seems like would qualify for you as being an issue.
Participant 33:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Thank you so much for your insights on those.
We're getting towards the end.
The last questions are really all about COVID, which has a large impact on people now.
Some of them will be more general and then some might be specifically with COVID and acquiring things.
Just generally, how has COVID-19 impacted your life?
