Interviewee37:
Conflict... Well, I live in a condominium and our condominium association won't schedule our meetings, I don't know if that's a conflict because I think they could somehow figure it out but it's not much of a conflict.
Interviewer:
Okay well-
Interviewee37:
I think a lot of times we find that the peoples' behavior is not safe and putting us at risk and that's created conflicts for us.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So like not socially distancing?
Interviewee37:
Yeah, not socially distancing, not masking, not caring at all about that.
Interviewer:
Okay, that's unfortunate, yeah.
Interviewee37:
Small confrontations with people but nothing dangerous.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So that was actually my last question.
