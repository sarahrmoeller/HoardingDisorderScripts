Interviewer:
Okay. So, that was a place that you could put your stuff where you wouldn't have to see it, so you wouldn't have to feel anxious about going through it?
Participant 018:
Yeah, but because I also needed the space [INAUDIBLE] and had to clear a way, space in my apartment, and then...
So, I had that unit for a few years, and then a friend helped me move back into my apartment, but then everything was piled up in containers, and I needed to use some things, so I would wind up having to pull things out, and then the clutter came back.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, you had it in the storage unit, and then you realized you needed to move all of it back into your apartment, and at first it was organized in all those containers, but as you started to use the stuff in the containers, it kind of became less and less organized?
Participant 018:
Yes.
I also had to give away quite a few things.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What was motivating you to give things away?
Participant 018:
The space.
Interviewer:
You just didn't have enough space, so you had to get rid of stuff?
Participant 018:
I wouldn't have had enough space to have everything all in one place.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 018:
Then a few years later, as my parents died, then I wound up having to accumulate all of their belongings.
Then I moved everything into storage in their area.
We had two units for a few months, and I consolidated everything to one.
Then a few years later I moved everything up here to where I live.
So, now I have...
It's accumulation of my things as well as what my parents had.
The only things I consider of value is the old letters and things right now.
Interviewer:
So, the most valuable thing that you're saving now is these letters?
Participant 018:
Yes, but then there's still a lot of bulk that's taking up the most space.
Some of it I'm trying to find the right place to recycle, like large books.
Interviewer:
So, it sounds like you're in the process of going through all of this stuff, and you're trying to find good homes for it still.
You're trying to not just get rid of it, but get rid of it in the right way?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
For example, with the large old books, you'd like to recycle them, and then there are other things that are important to you.
Participant 018:
Yeah, or take them to book places.
Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah.
So, then there are other things that are really still important to you, like the letters, and those things you plan to keep?
Participant 018:
Yes.
What I'm doing with those is I'm digitizing, and then I would like to have them organized and then hand off to another relative.
Interviewer:
So, those are important to you because they're attached to your family?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Right now, how much of a problem do you think your clutter or your stuff is in your life, right at the moment?
Participant 018:
It's overwhelming.
