Participant 46:
My papers, everything papers I spend a lot of time with. I put away my crystal vase, so I never see that but I know I have it. I put away the really nice things. I sorted my dad's photos, so I have those, but my papers, I'm always shuffling and going through, "Okay, what can I look at?" I'm also, like I said, a voracious reader, and a lot of times I didn't have stuff to read, so I always want something to read, you know what I mean? 
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 46:
I also, by the way, I steal magazines out of doctor's offices, so I have something to read. And I don't steal them to steal them, I steal them to read. It's so funny. Do I need more paper to take home? No, but if I've got five minutes I want to read, and I want to read something that I think is useful. I don't read fiction. I only read non-fiction, and I've got to have something to read that's useful, that I can use to expand my mind. By the way, cookbooks actually do that. Ooh, if I took it, sort of a chemistry experience. "Gee, I don't like this ingredient, what could I substitute, and boy, how's it taste afterward?" I used to have a lot of dinner parties, but now I don't have that anymore, so yeah. 
Interviewer:
When talking and distinguishing between hoarding disorder, what would you consider the most important difference between normal saving behavior, like collecting items, and hoarding disorder? 
Participant 46:
When it becomes unmanageable and-
Interviewer:
Unmanageable.
Participant 46:
Yeah, unmanageable. So there's a line where you collect maybe baby elephant statues. But if you cannot overrun your house because you now have 57,000 baby statues and you're breaking them, and you're... In fact, sometimes I want to break items so I don't, like that spice container. I actually want to break it. I can't throw it away whole, because now if it's broken, I can never use it, so-
Interviewer:
Do you do this with any items, as a way to-
Participant 46:
Yeah, I try to break things to get them out of my life. 
Interviewer:
So I know we discussed how to identify some people with hoarding disorder earlier. You mentioned different signs. So if you were to identify someone with hoarding disorder without being in their home, do you think that you would be able to do that, and what would you look for?
