Interviewer: SI understand.
Okay, so, the last question I have for you is just about the gift cards.
So, your Amazon gift card that you're going to receive, would you prefer that it would be electronic, or be like a physical gift card sent to you over mail?
Interviewee:
Well, I have a card from my first visit when I did something for that, um… I think a card would be fine because I'm sure that it’s—
Interviewer: Right, so a physical gift card since you prefer the mail.
Okay, perfect.
So, um, that should come in a couple weeks.
Obviously, there might be some delayed because of, you know, COVID-19 and everything.
Interviewee:
I am not worried about it.
It will be just a little present.
Interviewer: Definitely.
Alright, so, again, if you have any questions at all, I'm here to answer them.
But, I want to thank you for taking your time to answer these questions.
It's really helping us out.
Interviewee:
Oh honey, I’ll tell you what, um, when we went in our grandmother’s house to clean junk out we had to wait until she wasn’t there.
When I saw all the stuff in there it just, it just, it causes me to feel a little bit of panic.
Interviewer: Right, right.
So, anything you can do to, you know, help yourself with this for sure.
Okay, so any questions at all from you?
Interviewee:
No, I think you're wonderful.
I hope I made you a little bit jolly today.
Interviewer: Yes, of course.
Definitely, yeah.
Alright, well, I hope you have a great rest of your day.
Interviewee:
Thank you, I appreciate this so, so much.
Interviewer: No problem.
Alright, buh-bye now.
