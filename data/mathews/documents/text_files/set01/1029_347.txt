Participant 29:
No. No. No. When I lived in south Florida, we were having a hurricane, and it was my first hurricane that I was going to go through. And, I packed my car with so many things, that all the things that you would call the precious things.
I guess, I would say the first thing, thinking back on that. The first thing I packed were all the family photographs. So that's the most precious.
Interviewer:
So it seems like for you, sentimentality and especially remembering people that you love and things that they've done for you that they convey that they love you. Those are what's important?
Participant 29:
Huge. Yes. That's huge for me.
Interviewer:
And, I guess that would then lead me to think that if you had to choose between the items, the ones that you would keep would be the ones that mean the most to you or remind you of those that you love most?
Participant 29:
Correct.
Interviewer:
Okay. ... And you've already kind of touched on this element of hoarding disorder, but differentiating hoarding from collecting, what would you describe hoarding disorder as in comparison to collecting?
Participant 29:
I think hoarding disorder is you just have too much. It's the quantity of what you have that you don't necessarily have a good place for. Like I don't know how I want to describe this. Like if you have a collection, even though I don't collect things, one thing that I have that is a collection is teapots. And it's just that I've ended up with them from different family members, even though I never considered myself a teapot collector. But, I have a place for them. They're organized and displayed properly for a collection. So, that's how I think of a collection. ... Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah, that does make sense. You mentioned that quantity is the biggest thing that tells you that someone has hoarding disorder. How do you define too much stuff?
Participant 29:
... Well, it clutters up everything. How do you define that someone has too much stuff? The closets are full, the shelves are full. It overflows, it's the overflow of things into places where they don't belong. And, how many of an item do you really need?
Interviewer:
Like shirts and shoes that you mentioned earlier.
Participant 29:
And like when my pen drawer got full, I stopped taking pens that they're handing out to you all over the place. I thought, "No, I can't have anymore of those, because my pen drawer is full." So it would be just one more thing. I mean I don't even need all the pens that I have. It took the pen drawer filling up for me to know that, "Okay, you've got too many pens."
Interviewer:
Yeah, it was that physical marker of it not fitting in the space that it was allotted before?
Participant 29:
Exactly. Yeah.
