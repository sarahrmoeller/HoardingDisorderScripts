Interviewer:
Okay. The last question to wrap this whole interview up is, do you think this behavior gets in the way of your daily life?
Would you like to change it?
Why, or why not?
Interviewee:
Absolutely, I would like to change.
I would like to change because I'd like to have a house that I could have people come into without being embarrassed, and have things more organized.
I don't know how to do that.
I can't see the overall [INAUDIBLE] I could work on the kitchen counter and get the kitchen counters cleaned, but I don't know how to take the whole kit and caboodle of everything and do that.
And, I know I don't want anyone to do it for me just because of being afraid that I will lose something that's important, but I would love to be more organized.
I see I'm getting there, but I got a long ways to go.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well thank you for sharing that.
So this concludes...
