13:59 Interviewer:
So would it be valuable? So why would it be valuable? And what would happen if you were to lose it? 
Participant:
Um, I would be sad, it wouldn't be catastrophic, but I would think it was a shame.
14:17 Interviewer:
Okay. Um, so you mentioned that you do have some parts of your house that are cluttered. Do you think you have too much stuff? And how do you know whether you have too much stuff? 
Participant:
I have too much stuff because there’s not a place for it, and also, I can’t find things when I’m looking for them. 
14:38 Interviewer:
Okay, so definitely lack of organization and places to put things in and the annoyance of not being able to find things- that's how you know. 
Participant:
Yeah, and to be able to get to things. Like in the garage, I can't open the windows because there's a boat hanging on the wall that obscures the windows and that's not my problem, because it’s not my boat, but there are things that prevent other things from being used properly because it’s too cluttered. 
15:15 Interviewer:
Is it difficult for you to walk around your house?
Participant:
No, well the closet is the problem. The clothes closet... there are passageways that are obstructed in the garage, yes, but not the house.
15:35 Interviewer:
Okay. So if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Participant:
I would probably look at the utility. At the same time, if I'm using it, that would make it more likely that I would keep it. If something were damaged and something else were not damaged, I would keep the undamaged thing. I would probably look at the objective value of it. Like if someone were to come in and appraise it, I’d keep the thing that was of more, you know, objective value. That would probably be my decision making. 
16:31 Interviewer:
Okay, so utility and monetary value. 
Participant:
Yeah. 
16:36 Interviewer:
Okay, so the next section is about distinguishing hoarding disorder. So what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Participant:
You’re asking me?
16:55 Interviewer:
Yes, what do you think?
Participant:
I think that if it’s a problem then it’s disordered. 
17:06 Interviewer:
So someone with hoarding disorder... I'm sorry, could you elaborate a little bit more?
Participant:
Well I guess organization.. I’m thinking of a man I knew once that collected insects, and he had a room in his house that was filled with drawers and display cases and framed shadow boxes and you know he has thousands and thousands of insects in there. And the thing was not a hoarding disorder. It was a very extensive collection because if you asked him for whatever, he could go right to the drawer and show it to you.
