Participant:
We can't have people. We’re like kind of isolated right now. I wouldn't even let people like I'll be like, “I'll meet you at the restaurant.” They want to pick me up. I don't want you to pick me up because I don't want you to see this. They all know it.  People have offered to clean my house. I'm like, “No, you're not throwing my stuff out.” 
10:50 Interviewer:
Mm hmm. Okay, so there's like I'm like a factor of shame, maybe. 
Participant:
right. 
10:56 Interviewer:
Okay. Um, and have you ever sought to change and this behavior? 
Participant:
Sort of. Thinking that others could use some of the stuff. 
11:07 Interviewer:
Mm hmm. Right. Like you've mentioned that you're more cognizant about other people who could use your objects better than you could
Participant:
Yeah.
11:18 Interviewer:
Have you ever gone to a professional for help. 
Participant:
No, 
11:22 Interviewer:
why haven't you?
Participant:
Probably cuz i'm not i'm not being derogatory, that but I'm not like dirty. Because I’ve seen some. I have one dog. That's it. Because if it did ask. So I did one of those; I’m in another brain health thing for Alzheimers and it asked “how many pets do you have” and I had one. And my refrigerator is pristine. And it hasn’t caused be any health issues. That's probably says it the best, 
11:54 Interviewer:
Right. You just don't feel the need for it.
Participant:
Right. 
11:58 Interviewer:
Like I'm gathering. 
Participant:
Right
12:00 Interviewer:
Okay. And how do your family and friends feel about this behavior?
Participant:
Oh, considering my father did it.  I think my younger brothers do hoard. I think we all have that tendency. I've no idea why. We can't throw anything away because you may need it. And my father. Was very big on that. So I don't know what it just got drilled into us need it. Put it somewhere. I know that sounds odd but
12:38 Interviewer:
No, I like there's just like such a strong Like sense that it's been instilled in you as a child that you just continued it
Participant:
Yeah like what if you need it later.
12:54 Interviewer:
Um, how do you think your friends feel about the behavior.
Participant:
Um sort of saying “do you need help cleaning this?” [unclear] I don’t think it bothers them that much because the house isn’t dirty, it's just cluttered. And you got to head this way, and then that way. Get on over there, and shut up and they know that. I wash my hands constantly, so they know I’m clean. 
13:25 Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant:
They’ll offer but other than that. 
13:28 Interviewer:
Okay, so nothing, really. Um, so have you ever had conflicts with people close to you, or maybe landlords about your behavior?
Participant:
No, I own the house. 
13:42 Interviewer:
Okay. Um, but no conflicts with like any close relationships or anything. 
Participant:
I would say no
