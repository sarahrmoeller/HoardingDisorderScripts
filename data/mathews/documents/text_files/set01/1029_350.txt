So I have filled those and they're in the garage, whenever I fill a box, I put it in the garage.
But I have one in my office, in case I have anymore papers to put in it.
So it started really good.
I was motivated, I thought I don't have to go to any meetings, I'm not doing this or that.
But then, after maybe a month or six weeks, I'm not sure.
I've been in the house since March 12th.
So, I kind of started the ... the novelty started to wear off.
Interviewer:
That's a good way to put it.
Interviewee9:
And I could only do it for maybe an hour at a time, because then I would get anxiety.
So I would do as much as I can do, and then I'd think, "Okay, you'll just do some more tomorrow."
And I really was doing it every day.
But now, I'm really having to push myself to do it every day.
I'm still very involved with my volunteer work, and this past week has been extremely difficult with too many phone conversations, too many Zoom meetings, a couple of webinars.
So I don't beat myself up over when I have that much going on.
But there are some other times where I've thought, I really could have spent some time on this.
So I'm a mixed bag, but I think it has to do with my anxiety levels.
And ...
Like I said, the novelty wore off.
I got tired of it.
Interviewer:
When did that happen?
Interviewee9:
I'm saying four to six weeks end.
Interviewer:
That is a considerable amount of time anyways.
Interviewee9:
Pardon me?
Interviewer:
That is a considerable amount of time anyways for something to lose it's novelty, as you said.
Interviewee9:
Yeah.
I did get a fair amount done.
I'm really happy about what I got done.
But, I described the place in my house as it's like the loaves and the fishes, it doesn't seem to matter how much I get rid of.
I look around and it's still very cluttered.
Interviewer:
That probably leads to overwhelming feelings and contributes to the anxiety too, correct?
Interviewee9:
Yes.
Absolutely.s?
