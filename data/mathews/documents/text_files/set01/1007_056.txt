Interviewer:
Before we actually start the interview, I just have some basic demographic questions. The first one is what was your sex assigned at birth?
Participant 007:
Female.
Interviewer:
Okay, and then what gender do you identify as?
Participant 007:
I'm sorry?
Interviewer:
What gender do you identify as?
Participant 007:
Oh, female.
Interviewer:
And then your racial identification?
Participant 007:
White. Caucasian.
Interviewer:
And then are you Hispanic or Latino?
Participant 007:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. And then what is your highest degree or level or school you've completed?
Participant 007:
Master's degree.
Interviewer:
Okay, and then what is your household income, and it can be in a range. I don't need an exact.
Participant 007:
Somewhere around $25,000.
Interviewer:
Okay, and then, which geographic region best describes where you live in the US? Northeast-
Participant 007:
Northeast.
Interviewer:
Okay. All right. Okay. As you know, this study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question would be what term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 007:
What term I prefer?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 007:
I don't prefer any of them because I hate the whole thing, so I dislike hoarding. The term, "hoarding," I'll put it that way. I don't know what terms you have available, but sufferer, I guess, would be it. Hoarder is...I know I'm a hoarder, so I hate that term anyway.
Interviewer:
Right, so you want me to say, "difficulties with clutter?"
Participant 007:
Yes. That would-
Interviewer:
Oh, that's fine. Most of these topics we usually touch on a little bit more later in the interview, so we can always come back to them. Okay, this next part, I like to call it more conversational style. We're just going to be talking about your clutter problems and how you feel about them, and how your family feels about them.
For this first one, can you please describe how long your difficulties with clutter has been going on?
Participant 007:
Probably most of my life. My mother was extremely, a neat and tidy woman, and my bedroom was the bane of her existence, unfortunately, and it has not improved, and I've never really been in a situation where I've been forced to come to terms with it. Yeah, I'd say all my life.
Interviewer:
Okay, and how severe would you say your behavior is right now?
Participant 007:
Right now, it's quite severe.
Interviewer:
Okay. Have you ever sought to change this behavior? Have you gone for professional help?
Participant 007:
I didn't know there was professional help for cluttering. When I was moving in 2010, I paid someone to come in and help me, and she was very good because she would say, "Oh, when's the last time you used this?" And I'd say, [INAUDIBLE], y'know. "Two years ago? You don't need this." That's what I needed, is somebody to do that for me.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
