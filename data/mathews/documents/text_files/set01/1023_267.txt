Interviewer:
And so would you say... I know you mentioned TV shows, but where else have you heard of hoarding disorder? 
Participant 23:
My aunt, it was a really, really, really bad problem. I mean, she could have been on the shows, she just wasn't. As I said, her house had to be completely torn down when they actually removed her from it. I studied psychology, so I learned about it in my studies as a student and a professional, but also because personally it resonates with me. So I'm just aware of hearing about it when it comes up through. Well, you will hear about it. You will read about people in magazines or newspaper articles, you see it on TV. I know through my family, it's just something that I'm aware like something.
I think particularly it's probably more prevalent now because more people... Our culture, just like our old home doesn't have a lot of closet space. Our culture has shifted toward a more materially-focused society. Even for people who aren't hoarders, we focus on stuff and getting stuff. And so I think it's a more common issue now, I would guess than 100 years ago that people who have issues with trauma, or compulsivity, or society, or whatever their issues are that ends up playing out in this realm with issues with hoarding much more than it used to.
Interviewer:
Yeah, for sure. So you also mentioned earlier that looking at someone's car or the fact that they may carry an extra bag with them, those are ways like outside of someone's home that you can tell if they have issues with clutter or hoarding disorder. Are there any other ways that you can tell someone has these problems without being inside their home? 
Participant 23:
I mean, sometimes by what they say about their issues or their not letting people into their home or just a lack of organization. Weird things like someone who you've mailed them something, and they say, they never got it, they never saw it, they never looked at it, or they're going to look for it, a sort of chaotic, there's something chaotic and unreliable. I think unreliability sometimes and certainly you can be very unreliable and not look through your mail or not stick with an appointment or whatever, or not call people back and not be a hoarder. But I think sometimes it goes along with just a general disorganization. The lack of reliability in sort of some of their other interactions or ways of living. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. So it may manifest in their certain behaviors, what comes up in conversation, and maybe if they express some unreliability.
