Interviewer:
It sounds like it started maybe during your childhood when no one was teaching you how to properly organized and then it got worse as you got married to someone who was really into collecting.
Interviewee:
Yes, true.
Interviewer:
How severe would you say your behavior is now?
Interviewee:
Do I need to rate it somehow?
Interviewer:
No, like do you think it's a real big problem for you or is it something like I might need to work on it, but you don't feel like this immense pressure to change.
Interviewee:
There's a lot of pressure to change.
It's so time consuming that it's like the biggest problem ever sometimes.
You're spending time on something that you could do something else.
My daughter will say, "Why are you doing all this, because actually you need to do this."
Yeah, it's the central matter that has to be solved, yes.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you have sought to change your behavior.
Have you ever sought professional help with someone?
Interviewee:
Let me think.
No, I mean I did a little bit of temporary group counseling which was going to lead to personal, individual counseling, and then I asked a couple counselors of churches, but you're talking maybe three years ago.
I did a little phone counseling.
Other than that, not steady.
Interviewer:
Okay.
This counseling was to address the specific problem of collecting, right?
Interviewee:
I'm trying to remember.
Three years ago it was for my emotional state and my state of mind probably, but I would have got to that if the guy would have asked me to have half an hour phone sessions, I think that would happen.
Yeah, I kind of went through some [INAUDIBLE] living in my car and packing my stuff.
I think what happened was I didn't feel secure enough, I had certain numbers of things with me and I still do that to this very day so yes.
Interviewer:
How do your family and friends feel about your behavior?
Have you ever had conflicts with people close to you?
Interviewee:
Sure.
Yes.
Interviewer:
It sounds like your daughters really want to you change.
Are you feeling pressure from anyone else in your life maybe?
Interviewee:
Yes, at times there is an element of pressure.
Yes, that's true.
Interviewer:
From else would that be besides your daughters, would you be getting that pressure from?
Interviewee:
Let me think.
Probably one of my brothers, one of my cousins, the homeowner from I was renting a room, and now I'm getting a room.
Each of my landlords so to speak.
That's why I'm kind of on top of it sometimes, because of...
Interviewer:
Because of like your landlords?
Interviewee:
Yes.
