Interviewee:
Well, with my husband, I mean we've just been married for five years.
Yeah, he would prefer that we not have so much disorganization because he likes things to be orderly, but there's just some spaces that I just had to tell him, "You just have to leave it," you know we have to compromise on it.
Yeah, I mean it has created some difficult times for us.
It would be good if we could have that bedroom either turn it into a closet or use it for a guest bedroom, you know.
When people come, I mean I have other guest bedrooms in the house so it's not really an issue because we have two other bedrooms we can use for guests.
It would be nice to be able to have some organization in that room so that I don't have to keep the door closed.
Interviewer:
Do you feel that the saving and acquiring new items and having an accumulation of items is a problem for you?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Yeah I like to spend money and I like, like I say, I said before, I like to have a variety of choices when it comes to my personal body, like dressing and accessories and things like that.
Yeah I have a tendency to accumulate more than I need.
Interviewer:
In the past have you ever tried to diminish the spending on items, or the accumulation of new items?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Oh yeah, yeah that's a constant battle.
Interviewer:
Has anything helped with it?
Interviewee:
Has anything helped?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Well yeah.
I mean I started having foot problems a little over a year ago, and I got to where I couldn't wear a lot of my shoes.
I had a lot of shoes.
I've gotten rid of a ton of shoes, and I've also stopped buying shoes for the most part.
I have bought a few pair that are better for my feet, but having foot problems kind of created the need to stop spending money on shoes, and it also has forced me to get rid of a bunch of shoes that are no longer comfortable, or good for my feet.
Then weight gain is always an issue, and so I've outgrown some clothes that this is a problem.
I've outgrown some of my clothes but I refuse to get rid of them because I think, "Oh I'm going to lose some weight and I'm going to get back in them."
The reality is that's probably not the case.
There are some things that I probably should just go ahead and dispose of.
If I do lose weight I'll just buy new clothes probably.
Interviewer:
How do you decide when you should be getting rid of an item?
Will that be something that you wear or any other kind of item, maybe not clothing or jewelry?
Interviewee:
How do I decide when to get rid of it?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
