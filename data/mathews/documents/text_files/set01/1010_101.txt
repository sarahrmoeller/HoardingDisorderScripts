Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Okay. What would you say is the most precious item for you in your house?
Interviewee:
The most precious?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Interviewee:
I suppose clothes is.
Other than that, it would be books and movies.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What makes your clothes so valuable to you?
Interviewee:
Well, I'm just trying to think what I would hate to have to replace the most, and clothes would be expensive and hard to go shopping, so that's why I would say clothes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What do you think would happen if you lost all your clothes or gave all of them away?
Interviewee:
Well, I wouldn't have enough money to replace them and I'd be very unhappy because I'd be wearing the same thing all over again or not have the kind of things I like to wear.
Interviewer:
Yeah, true.
Do you think that you have too much stuff?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How do you know?
Interviewee:
Because I've got more than the closet will hold.
I've got shoes.
Way too many shoes.
People keep giving me clothes for Christmas.
I keep telling them not to.
They keep doing it, so I've got them and the closet's full.
There's a foot locker at the bottom of the bed that's stacked high with them.
Every drawer in the bedroom is full of clothes.
There's a laundry basket full of clothes.
There's always clothes on the bed.
Dirty clothes on the floor.
Interviewer:
Okay.
If you had to choose between your items, so let's say for example, that you throw away certain clothes and keep others, how would you choose?
Interviewee:
By the color and by the fit.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Does your clutter issues, do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Interviewee:
Yeah, pretty much.
Interviewer:
Can you describe to me a time that it got in the way of something that you really wanted?
Interviewee:
Well, I would like to have people come over here once in a while and I really don't feel comfortable inviting anybody in here.
And sometimes I misplace something.
Makes it very difficult to find it.
Lay the phone down, you can't find the phone.
Interviewer:
Okay, all right.
That's good.
Has it upset any of your friends or family?
Interviewee:
I don't think so.
Interviewer:
Has it ever impacted your relationship, such as romantic?
Interviewee:
Repeat that one.
Interviewer:
Has it ever impacted your romantic relationships or your work?
Interviewee:
No.
