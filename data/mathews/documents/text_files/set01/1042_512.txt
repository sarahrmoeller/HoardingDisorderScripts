Interviewer:
There's just one more question before we get started.
Now that you know this study is investigating individuals attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorders.
The first question would be what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and discarding?
Participant 042:
Which term?
That's a good question.
When I first came down, what were they saying?
I think they called it collecting.
I think that was a polite term, collecting.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Would you like me to use that?
Participant 042:
It's okay if you want to.
I'm not offended either way.
Whatever's simple.
Interviewer:
It's just your preference.
It's whatever you prefer.
Participant 042:
Okay.
Collecting sounds good to me.
Interviewer:
That concludes the free listing session of our interview, and the next section is going to be divided into a few different segments and it's going to be more conversation style.
This first section is going to be about behavior and treatment seeking.
Can you please describe your collecting problems and how long they've been going on?
Participant 042:
Let's see.
Probably the first... I wasn't raised with people who were teaching or showing an example of extremely gathering, collecting, hoarding, but I was married 26 years to someone who did some extreme collecting and hoarding and then I started fighting.
Then I did it myself and saw it in my two daughters.
What year was it?
Probably from 1989 all the way through to about 2010, and then kind of a break, then I still have too much with the papers, the books, and the documents and the envelopes and the office supplies and stuff.
I still have that obsession, but I no longer have that home where there's a lot of things.
I don't own that home, so that's been helpful.
I've learned some things.
How to keep going and go for less, but it's like a lifetime battle.
That's what it is.
