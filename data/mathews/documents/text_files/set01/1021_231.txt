Okay. As you know, the study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to hoarding disorder.
The first question will be, what term would you prefer when you're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Interviewee:
What term?

Yes.
Interviewee:
It doesn't really matter to me.
Interviewer:
So hoarding disorder is fine with you?

Yeah, that's fine.

Then what is your highest degree or level of school that you've completed?

Interviewer:
What is your household income?
We have ranges so you can pick from 10,000 to 20,000, 20,000 to 35-, it can be a range.
It doesn't have to be exact.
Interviewee:
I would say it varies a little bit, but I would say about, between 50- and 70,000.
Interviewer:
Then what geographic region best describes where you live in the US, Northeast, Midwest, South or West?
Interviewee:
Northeast.
Interviewer:
That kind of completes the free listing section.
This next section is more conversation style, and it's broken up into different kind of subsections.
The first one is talking about behavior and treatment seeking.
So if you can please describe your hoarding problem and how long it's been going on.
Interviewee:
I was just recently thinking about that.
I think it started in probably my late twenties, so it's been going on for a while.
There was a point where I one time was moving, and I had a lot of stuff in my house, and I just hired an auctioneer to pretty much come in and sell as much of... just about everything in the house, to auction it off.
I sort of stayed out of it.
So I got rid of a lot of the stuff that way.
But then I started when I moved, I started buying more things.
For me, I don't know, maybe...
I've been told I'm cheap, but I get some satisfaction if I get stuff for a good deal.
Like, all my furniture in my house I've pretty much brought through auctions.
My sister recently called me and told me she's looking at a new couch.
She wants to spend $600 on it, and I got really frustrated with her.
It's like, "You have a mortgage.
You're paying interest on your mortgage.
Yet you're going to go out and spend $600 on a couch.
You should be putting that towards your mortgage amount and get it down."
But I don't know.
I guess that's just me.
