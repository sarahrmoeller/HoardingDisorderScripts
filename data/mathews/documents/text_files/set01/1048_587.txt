Interviewee48:
[INAUDIBLE] beyond clutter when you have a chair that people can't sit in, because there's all kinds of stuff on it, you know?
I don't have a lot of wide open space.
My carpet, my central area of the room, I have clothes folded and stacked and thrown everywhere.
I have a lot of fans.
I have, I still have a lot of books.
But it's not like, none of them are organized.
It is disorder.
Chaos.
Interviewer:
So anything that's disordered and chaotic, you would consider cluttered.
Interviewee48:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee48:
Well, as long as it's sanitary.
Anything unsanitary [INAUDIBLE] house, right?
Interviewer:
Exactly.
Interviewee48:
If it grows or organic or mold or anything that is unhealthy, that's not clutter.
That's a different issue.
And that's not an issue that I have.
My clutter is, there's nothing unsanitary about it.
It is hygienic.
It's just too much stuff for the space that I have.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So I remember you mentioned-
Interviewee48:
Having this conversation's helpful to me, because it makes me all the more optimistic that having talked this out, the next two weeks I'll get this done.
I'll get it done in a week.
Interviewer:
That's awesome.
Interviewee48:
Let's cross our fingers.
Interviewer:
Yes.
Love the optimism.
Interviewee48:
Let's just believe that.
Interviewer:
Yes.
Interviewee48:
It can happen.
I mean, I can do it.
Interviewer:
Right.
Yes.
So you mentioned before that you desire to live in an open and aesthetic space.
I remember those words being said.
Is there any other ways you would like your home to look?
Interviewee48:
I'm aware that having things everywhere makes everything a lot harder than it should be.
When I go to, I lose things all the time, and spend sometimes days looking for my keys or looking for my wallet, or whatever.
And having things that I don't remember that I have, it's been a long time since I've seen them, and they're not a part of my life.
And I would like to not be embarrassed about my living space.
I'd like to have, be okay with people coming in and seeing how I live.
Interviewer:
Right.
So being open and things being organized would make things just whole on living and finding your items so much easier.
Interviewee48:
It would make things a lot more easier.
Utilitarian is what I would aspire to.
Interviewer:
Great word.
So, how important are your things for you to feel at home, and which of your things do you think are the most important to you?
