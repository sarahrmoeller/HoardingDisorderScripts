Interviewee:
I think the differences is, a lot of times there is a gray area, but I think it's quality of life.
You can say with extremes, if it interferes with your ability to use your home or to have someone into your home or to keep up your home, repair it, then obviously that's a problem.
That's a problem.
But I think in the gray area, it becomes even an issue, as I said, with quality of life or you don't want to host people or you feel stress about hosting because you have to clean and prepare and do those kinds of things first.
So I think in the starting of that gray area of a problem, if it affects your ability.
Where it starts affecting social interactions, and hosting, and relationships within the family.
If there's tension over too much stuff and getting rid of it, then I think even though objectively, it isn't like interfering with health at that point, it's still it's becomes through the relationship dynamics and quality of life.
It's becoming a problem.
It's something that needs to be addressed for highest quality of life.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So would you say that collecting to hoarding is kind of like on a spectrum and there is this gray area between the two where things might start developing and becoming a problem, but it's when things like safety, quality of life, deteriorating relationships come into play, where that might be more considered on the hoarding side than collecting.
Would you agree?
Interviewee:
Yes.
And I mean, I do see it all as like a continuum.
It's just where you are and when it starts affecting somebody's life enough that it's really interfering with the quality of their life then it's becoming a problem.
Yeah, but it's all that sort of that continuum.
Interviewer:
Yeah, definitely.
So you've kind of described a little bit about what hoarding disorder looks like, but can you kind of go into detail a little bit more and how is this the same or different from your behavior?
