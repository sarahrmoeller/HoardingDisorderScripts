Participant 37:
We've removed the clutter from the garage.
I have a room upstairs which is cluttered in a lot of containers and I need to go through them.
Am I too INAUDIBLE in answering the questions?
Interviewer:
No, no worries.
If I feel like we're going off on a tangent I'll interrupt you but no that was great.
Participant 37:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So, you're decluttering your garage right now.
Do you believe that your behavior is a problem or has it gotten better over time?
Participant 37:
Well I think the fact that I no longer buy like I had means I'm going in the right direction.
I have other friends who continue to buy, and my brother.
When I hear what they're doing in my mind I say, "no, you're going the wrong way."
So, in my mind they're going the wrong way.
I could dump everything and my life would be fine but I'm still...maybe I'm devoting my cluttering energies towards trying to get a return even it's small because I know people will buy some of these things.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
I could give you an example if you want but I'm going to let you decide whether you want to find out how well I'm doing or INAUDIBLE.
Interviewer:
No, please, you could share.
An example would be great.
Participant 37:
Okay, so in the middle 70s I became a fan of the band Kiss, are you old enough to know Kiss?
Interviewer:
Yes, I do know who they are.
Participant 37:
Well they're famous enough that even a college student would know.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
Well, in 1976 they were a real INAUDIBLE band and they weren't mega stars yet but I saw them and they were amusing, I like the music, so I bought a Kiss garbage can, I bought about five Kiss belt buckles.
Interviewer:
Oh wow.
Participant 37:
So, you may say, "How many belt buckles does a person need?" And the answer is one, okay?
But I had more than one and I think I sold one years ago because I haven't seen it but a few weeks ago I found three or four others and one of them I didn't get rid of but the other three I was able to sell for over $600.
Interviewer:
Oh wow.
Participant 37:
So I got rewarded for my behavior.
Interviewer:
It just maybe took awhile but that's okay.
Participant 37:
It what?
Interviewer:
It just maybe took awhile but it worked.
Participant 37:
Well in a sense it was good that I let them sit in a box for 40 years.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
The person who bought them said that they could have gone for more money so perhaps the pandemic has changed the way people are spending their money.
Interviewer:
For sure.
Participant 37:
I was happy with the money I got.
I hadn't been following the market if there is such a thing.
