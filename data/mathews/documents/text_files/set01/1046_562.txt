Participant 46:
Well, I'm a master so I can use every room. But there is an extra bedroom that you really need to balance yourself on, and I don't go in there too much. Every room has a path. The bathroom is immaculate. Believe it or not, I keep the bathroom spic-and-span. I think it's the germ thing. I'm also a germaphobe. Isn't that funny? I'm a germaphobe but I'm a hoarder. Everything I own is clean, it's just stacked. So, but my bathroom's immaculate. So my bathroom is not hoarded at all, so-
Interviewer:
There's nothing in there? No clutter. 
Participant 46:
Yeah that, but the bedrooms, my master I've been slowly cleaning out, trying to, and the downstairs I started because the contractor says he can't work on it, so like I said, I go down there once a day or once a week and try and get a box, and I try to just judge it. "Do I really need this? I haven't looked at in in 40 years. Will I ever need this again?" I even had an employee... I'm a supervisor, and I had an employee record, and he'd passed away two years ago, so he's never going to contest anything I said or did with him, and I finally was able to shred his papers, because that's the final act. He passed away, right? So I was able to get down some boxes out of there, which I'm never going back to that work, so... But I can tell I've made a change. Instead of ten tenths of being hoarded I am not nine tenths, and even some days eight tenths, and some days seven tenths. I'm not below a seven yet.
Interviewer:
I'm glad you're feeling better about your progress. Also you mentioned, since you said there are no rooms that aren't blocked, are there different objects or parts of your home that you aren't able to use in the way that they were intended?
Participant 46:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Such as your bathtub, or your stove?
Participant 46:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Yes? Can you tell that?
