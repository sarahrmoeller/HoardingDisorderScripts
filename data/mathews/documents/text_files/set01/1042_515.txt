Participant 042:
Oh, boy. Dream, dream, dream. I don't know. The thing that I'm connected with is and have what I think of in my way of thinking of order is my garden and I work it in everyday and when I don't work, it's my clutter. Do I avoid it? Yeah, I guess it would be everything filed in one really small file cabinet or some drawers that have labels, that would be good. That would indicate these items are being used and not to have any... I guess the goal would be items that have no use and are not useful.
Interviewer:
I know that you mentioned that you like to spend time in the garden. Sorry. I don't know how to word this question. How important is it for you to feel at home with your things and which objects do you spend the most time with?
Participant 042:
The most time with? I guess I divide my time between everything lately. I'll do bookwork or something, looking for documents, that's a time waster, I'll be looking for lost stuff, trying to organize it, throw it away. It could be three hours, three times a week, but then I will go to the pleasant hard work that is outdoors and do that agriculture stuff in my garden, almost every day, maybe five to six days a week I'll work on that.
Interviewer:
Of this time you're spending, which is the most important to you? Working with your files, outside or maybe something else?
Participant 042:
That's a good question too. I think it's changing. I think I'm undergoing a change with it, because I know it's time for a change and I know change is good. I'll try to close up what I'm doing and go... I guess I'm a little ADD. That's true. I've been told I am. I'll just kind of walk away from one thing and do the other thing if that makes sense.
Interviewer:
You don't have like maybe a preference? There's not one that's the most important to you?
Participant 042:
That's a good question. Is it really? I think doing the agriculture in the garden, that's a lifelong project too. Sometimes I teach people how to do that. If I really need to put a number one thing, that would be it, if I could categorize it, if I could prioritize it.
Interviewer:
Okay. When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable? How do you determine their value?
Participant 042:
When I think about my possessions how do you determine their value? For example, we'll say I have seeds for the garden and more than I need. I determine their value, because I thought that I needed those, but I also thought somebody else, I need to share this and someone else will need it. I think that's what I base it on.
