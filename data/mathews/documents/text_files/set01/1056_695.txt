Participant:
I guess I would choose the one that I thought was most likely to be… um… put to use by someone at some point in the not too distant future.
Interviewer (26:34): Okay. Alright, so, now we’re going to talk a little bit about distinguishing between collecting things or liking to have some stuff around and behavior that could potentially be problematic. So, in your opinion, what do you think are the most important differences between what’s considered like, normal saving behavior and um, hoarding?
Participant:
Well I guess, oh and again it’s an external thing, if nobody else can see the value of what you are retaining um, that makes it a little bit more of a problem. 
Interviewer (27:25): Mhmm.
Participant:
Um… if it is not as easy to put a, for instance a financial value on something, um, it in other people’s eyes might be more of a problem. 
Interviewer (27:46): Mhmm.
Participant 056 (2:47) 
Um, but… restate the question please.
Interviewer (27:52): Yeah, sure. So, what do you think are the most important differences between what’s considered normal saving behavior and hoarding?
Participant:
And I guess if you have too many of the same sort of thing it’s not, you know, like you’re collecting baseball cards or something for the purpose of having a collection, um, then that getting, you certainly wouldn’t want to accumulate too many crescent wrenches or something along those lines. Uh, so I guess the, again, for me, it’s to some degree an external perception issue more than an internal perception issue in that, um…
Interviewer (28:56): Okay.
Participant:
Hmm, I don’t know.
Interviewer (29:01): it’s okay. So, in your opinion, if you had to identify someone with hoarding disorder, what might that look like?
Participant:
It might look like my office expanded to occupy the entire home.
Interviewer (29:20): Right.
Participant:
And I suppose again, to me, it would concern if it resulted in um, a health or hygiene issue being raised, or it exceeded the ability to maintain a clean environment or I should say, I guess a clean environment might be to your interpretation, I guess a hygienic environment. Uh…
Interviewer (30:03): So, when it would become a hazard you would definitely say that it would be more like hoarding disorder, right?
Participant:
Yeah. That would definitely be more of a concern than someone that just had a lot of stuff and they had the wherewithal to accommodate this stuff without it being a hazard to their health or to other people’s health.
Interviewer (30:31): Right. So, in your case, it’s never really been an issue that was, you know a health threat or anything to anyone, or you know a potential danger to anyone? It’s never really been like that?
Participant:
The only danger would be to me if a significant other were to pop me in the head because I didn’t get moved what she wanted me to move.
