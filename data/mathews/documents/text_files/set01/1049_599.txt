And the needlepoint, the things that I bought ...
All the needlepoint is very special, quality needlepoint that I really want to work on and that I like displaying and framed or whatnot, or giving away.
The knitting, half of it is for me, and half of it is for charity.
So if I needed to get rid of yarn, I could give away the charity projects and things still go to charity, just somebody else has to put them together and knit them or something.
My books are hard to let go.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So would you say-
Participant 49:
I can let some books go.
Interviewer:
Sorry, go ahead.
Participant 49:
I can let outmoded books go.
I used to teach math and programming, and with that 1000 books I let go, a lot of them were books from college, and books from having taught lower level math.
But now I'm even ready, when I go in the same room where the math books are and the computer books, I could probably get rid of all but one or two math books, and I could probably get rid of all my programming books, give away them.
And so I'm ready to give away the topics that I used to have, to make room for my new books, that are newer topics.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, when you think about these possessions like your books and your needlepoint work and stuff, what makes them valuable, and how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
Participant 49:
The needlepoints are valuable if they're quality needlepoint.
They're not cheap ones.
I don't know a nicer way to put that.
They're quality needlepoints with wool, and they're beautiful designs that I think are artistic in one way or another.
The knitting is yarn and patterns, sweaters and whatnot that I like or have plans to give to so-and-so.
And the books are full of ideas I want to read and know.
The books and the needlepoint are the very hardest to get rid of.
They're either beautiful or interesting, or both.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, what about any other objects in your home?
How do you decide if they're valuable or not?
Participant 49:
You know what, I have a lot of pottery.
I haven't collected pottery in a long while, so the hoarding of pottery is under control.
I could still get rid of more stuff, but I put it in the basement, but I'm not buying it anymore.
And that was based on potters whose works I'd like.
