Interviewer:
Okay. I know you mentioned earlier that it's easy for you to throw away things like food wrappers and things that are considered, by most, to be trash so how do you know when it's time to throw something away or if something is trash.
How do you know that?
Participant 30:
Well with things like food wrappers, although then you get into sometimes something comes in a jar that looks like that could be useful.
I think papers, sometimes it's just a matter of over time, you realize that after a certain amount of time that it has no values.
Papers are not that hard for me to get rid of.
What's hard is sitting down and looking at each one and making a decision.
I think making a decision for me is the hard part.
Interviewer:
What's kind of your process when you're making those decisions?
Participant 30:
[INAUDIBLE] ... anywhere else.
I tend to keep things like bank statements.
I think if I throw these out, I won't be able to get it again, and at one time I thought, I could digitize everything, but that's just an overwhelming project that never happened.
Interviewer:
So definitely you can feel overwhelmed when it comes time to get rid of things or figure out when it's time to throw things away?
Participant 30:
I think it's the idea of, asking this is kind of making me think, why is this such a problem, and I think it is the decision making, and there's always something else that needs to be done.
I could sit down and go through all the papers on my dining table, and file things away or throw them away, but that requires making a lot of decisions, and I'm not real good at that, I don't think.
It's hard for me to make quick decision.
I have to kind of ruminate about everything.
Interviewer:
Right, right.
Okay.
Now I'm going to talk a little bit about how the clutter has kind of interfered, if at all, with your life.
Do you think that it is an upsetting thing for you?
And does it get in the way of your daily life tasks?
Participant 30:
I don't think it gets in the way of my daily tasks, but I feel like, some of my friends, just kind of know how it is, and I think people that I don't know that well, I'd be really reluctant to have them come over to my house because I would feel like I would have to kind of, I call it bulldozing.
Just kind of scoop everything up and put it in another room so that you have at least one or two rooms, public rooms that look reasonable.
Interviewer:
Right, right.
Participant 30:
[INAUDIBLE] ... once you bulldoze, then it's really hard to find things.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 30:
Especially if you don't go through it right away.
