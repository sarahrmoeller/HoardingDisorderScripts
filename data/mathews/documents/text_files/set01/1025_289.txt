Interviewee:
Oh yeah.
Moving will cause you to discard, and I was in my other house for what, 23 years, or 24 years, so I had a lot of opportunity to accumulate a lot of stuff, so moving into this house, like I said I got rid of a lot of shoes, and other things.
We got rid of a lot of things, but we still have a lot of stuff.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Whenever you live somewhere for longer than a few years it collects.
Like you said, if you don't actively think about discarding items you continue to accumulate.
Interviewee:
Yep, yeah.
I try to think about that more now when I bring stuff in.
It's like, "Okay what can I get rid of to make space?"
Interviewer:
When did you start thinking in that manner, and what made you aware of thinking of discarding in addition to getting new items?
Interviewee:
I think when I had to downsize my mother and bring all of her stuff under my roof.
I got rid of a bunch of stuff, but then I brought in everything that I wasn't willing to get rid of.
Prior to that she had lived in Pennsylvania, and I'm in Texas.
Before I moved her down here, a couple of years, I spent a couple weeks, or one week, one summer up at her apartment.
I was trying to kind of lay the groundwork for this move, even though I didn't know when it was going to happen.
She was very cluttered too with her closets and her clothes and her cabinets and everything.
I spent a whole week.
Oh she had a garage, one part of her garage was stacked to the ceiling.
Our garage you can walk through, and it's not stacked to the ceiling.
Anyway, I started, I don't know I Kind of had a burden about that, and so I went up there, spent a week of my vacation up there cleaning out her closets and her cabinets and we hauled off so much stuff.
Going through that, and then not long after that we moved her into a smaller space, and then it was just the gradual downsizing of her that started making me think, "I need to do this for myself so that someone else doesn't have to be burdened by it."
Interviewer:
Okay so it's mainly the thinking of burdening others with it that's ...
Interviewee:
Right, yeah.
Interviewer:
It really doesn't click until you do it for someone else when you realize, "Wow someone will probably be doing this one day for me."
Interviewee:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer:
How long ago was this?
