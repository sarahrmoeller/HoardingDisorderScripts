Interviewer:
Okay, thank you for that, so the next story is a little different now. John Doe has clothes that he keeps in case he needs to use in the future. Clothes occupy most of his room, except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it's difficulty for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventuality finds them. When this happens, he's usually late in getting where he needs to be. For this one, do you think this person has hoarding disorder or is it more like clutter problems?
Interviewee:
I still think it's on the hoarding side. It's just more specific to a certain type of item, it's the specific to clothes.
Interviewer:
Yeah, do you think this person should try to change their behavior, in your opinion?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I mean, you can find ways that he could probably still collect or keep clothes but not to that extreme. Get organized better, so maybe just change a little and not having to change from one extreme to the other.
Interviewer:
Does this behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
Not necessarily, I've seen people on shows like Konmari, or whatever, where she's gone into homes and changed people's lives. There's a lot of people that can help others that have been through it. But psychiatrists, they make a big a difference, it just depends on the person, I think.
Interviewer:
Yeah, of course. Is this behavior similar or different to that of your own?
Interviewee:
I mean, I do collect a lot of clothes, but I've had a lot weight shifting ups and downs, but I tend to keep it all in the bedroom. I mean, I do keep it all in the bedroom, whether it's a combination of the closet and the floor, that's about it. Like I described earlier, from the basket to the laundry bag, and then the closet, and on hangers in the closet. But the stuff that I use the most is the ones I wash and then put in the basket, and then put in the... But I still have other clothes in the dresser, and other clothes in the closet. Probably not to the same extent, but a little bit lesser.
