Interviewer:
As you know, the study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.
The first question would be, what term you would prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter or discarding?
Interviewee:
My difficulties with clutter?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Ma'am.
Interviewee:
The problem is I don't put things away.
Interviewer:
Do you have a particular name you'd like to use.
Some people prefer clutter difficulty.
Some people prefer to hoarding disorder.
Do you have a preferred term?
Interviewee:
Well, no, not really.
There are two aspects of events.
One is, I put one project on top of the other, without putting the first project away.
Many of the things that I use in the second project involve using the tools from the first project.
But some things could be put away.
Instead, they're simply swept aside and they're still there.
The other thing is, everything is in the way.
I know that goes right up against clutter.
Make sure everything has its place and put it there.
Two things are involved.
One, is fabric and sewing machines, tools, rotary cutters, et cetera..
That's one part of it.
The other is, I have projects which have not yet been completed, which are now in boxes.
I have a stack of fabric that I get from wherever.
I never turn down fabric if someone has it to give me, which I can make bags for.
Originally, much of that fabric was to make bags for the school kids at the United Methodist Church, as charity kind of thing, but they have stopped needing bags, just putting it in a big two gallon, so I don't need that material.
But material or fabric, I can't bear to use it because then I won't have it to use.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
It sounds like a lot of this is dealing with fabric and having a lot of projects, but then when you use the fabric, you won't have it to use in the future.
Interviewee:
It's a convoluted thing in my mind.
My thinking is, "Interviewee, why can't you use it?
That's what it's there for, period."
Interviewer:
Are you okay with me using clutter problems as kind of that overarching term to describe that, or do you have something else you would prefer?
Interviewee:
An overarching terms for what now?
Interviewer:
Just kind of when we're discussing difficulties with putting tools away or things with fabric.
I'm just looking for a good term that I can use to kind of describe that as a whole.
Interviewee:
That has described that as a whole.
I don't know.
Maybe I'll think of it as we go along.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I also have that problem is, I'll think of things 15 minutes later, what the word is.
Interviewer:
That happens to me too.
I'll go-
