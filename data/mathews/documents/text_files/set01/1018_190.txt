Interviewee:
Although, I would be able to move things a little at a time in a vehicle, if I can put them somewhere else.
Interviewer:
So, it's hard to move your stuff around in the way that it is currently stored?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
What sorts of things are in your apartment right now?
What sorts of things are causing clutter?
Interviewee:
Well, it's the things from storage like records, and then the electronic cables and stuff.
Interviewer:
So, records, electronic cables?
Interviewee:
CROSSTALK
Interviewer:
I'm sorry?
Interviewee:
A lot of clothes and miscellaneous.
Interviewer:
So, clothes, miscellaneous things.
Okay.
Do you think that your living space right now is comfortable?
Is it comfortable for you?
Interviewee:
No, not right now.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What would a comfortable living space look for you?
How would you like your apartment to look?
Interviewee:
I would like to move to a place that had enough space to organize it.
I would like to have everything organized.
Anything I have I would like to be in one particular container or shelf, like each item separated...
Interviewer:
So, it sounds like...
Go ahead.
Interviewee:
... and then I can see whatever I don't need.
I could figure out some other place where it could go.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, it sounds like the problem with your apartment now is that you don't have the space to be able to see what you have, and so it's keeping you from getting organized because everything has to stay in the containers, and that prevents you from even knowing what's there and being able to go through it.
So, ideally, you would like a space that's...
Go ahead.
Interviewee:
Actually, I do kind of know what is in the containers, but there are occasions where I do not know where something is or if I still have it.
Interviewer:
And that causes anxiety?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So, an ideal apartment for you or an ideal living space would be more space than you have now, and it sounds like ideally, I would have this space to have everything laid out in an organized manner, in its proper place, and have all of your stuff-
Interviewee:
Yeah, and then I would also be able to reduce what I have because then I can see what I have too much of or what I don't need, and then I could either try to give it away or sell it or whatever.
Interviewer:
So, your ideal living space would be bigger and would allow you that organizational room?
Interviewee:
Yeah, and I wouldn't have to have a storage unit because I would have everything all in one place.
Interviewer:
Would you prefer to have all of your items in your home?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
