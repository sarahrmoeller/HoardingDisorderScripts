Participant 035:
That's the blessing, because in 2016, the IT consulting industry was really changing.
Our company downsized, and I got laid off, was the deal.
After that for about a year, for a few months, basically, when I finished my last assignment, I was back on the bench, and then, the company said okay, everybody on the bench, we're not going to pay you full salary anymore, which is what we'd had for years.
They said, we're going to pay you 20% of your salary.
That was a huge hunk down.
I already had a little pension from taking early retirement from another job, and that helped.
Then, I would pick up gigs here and there, but then in February, it was, we're still not getting clients, we still don't have anything, going to have to let you go.
I thought, my plan here is, let's do all those things that I couldn't do when I was out of town working.
Started out with a physical, and they found calcifications on the mammo, and went back, had a core biopsy, and got it treated, taken care of.
Interviewer:
I'm so glad that that-
Participant 035:
Feeling good about that.
Interviewer:
... timing worked out.
Was that this past year, or was that-
Participant 035:
Yeah, it's kind of like, whoa, have the fates intervened here?
Interviewer:
Yeah, the timing was really-
Participant 035:
Because I had absolutely no symptoms, no nothing, just these little-
Interviewer:
Amazing.
Participant 035:
... micro-calculi in the ducts.
Interviewer:
You couldn't even feel them.
It sounds to me, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm saying this back to you to check, it sounds like with your stuff and your clutter, and being home with it, it sounds like you've more avoided the spaces that are cluttered, and stayed in the front of the house where it's less cluttered, and just shoved the clutter out of your mind.
Is that true, or do you feel like you spend a lot of time in the spaces that are cluttered?
Participant 035:
No, I spend a lot of time in the back of the house.
The house has a living room up in front, and then a big family room.
Big open space, kitchen, breakfast, family room in the back of the house.
I'm right in the middle of the clutter.
Interviewer:
Tell me about your space.
Tell me about the cluttered space.
Which rooms does it take up, and what is it like in those rooms?
