Interviewee:
Yeah. I think a lot of orderliness might be a sign of it.
My dad's book collection was very highly ordered, but I think there's this sense of people ...
And I don't know, but hoarding, everything just sort of piles up.
But in my dad's case, if you asked him about a book, out of 10,000 he would know if he had it.
He would know where it was.
Interviewer:
Right.
That's an interesting point.
Yeah, certain things that maybe people care about the most are actually organized.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Okay.
So, now we're going to go into the third part of this.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
And basically, I'm going to read you some vignettes, so some little stories, and I just want you to tell me whether or not these people have a hoarding disorder or maybe they just have a little clutter, or collectors, stuff like that.
Okay.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
The first one says, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in.
He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but here are no boxes in other rooms.
His house is not always organized, but it is usually not cluttered.
Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet.
So, he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens, he is rarely late in getting where he needs to be.
Do you think this has hoarded?
Interviewee:
I'm laughing to myself because I have lots of boxes, and that probably is something that's a little hard for me to get rid of, especially with all the moves.
I'm probably going to need that box again.
I can get some use out of it.
But it's not ...
That isn't too bad for me to get rid of, but ...
Interviewer:
So, what do you think about this person?
Do you think that's ...
Interviewee:
I mean, it's not significantly affecting his quality of life.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
So, I would say maybe he's got some signs of it, but I wouldn't say that he's got a disorder.
