Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah. What would happen if you-
Participant 011:
I have no problem getting rid of good furniture though.
I mean, expensive furniture.
I can get rid of any day of the week.
I can sell it.
So yeah, a lot of things that people made for me and things like that, like the art stuff that people made for me, that stuff is hard to get rid of.
That's the most difficult stuff I can get rid of is stuff that people have made for me.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So what would happen if you somehow lost some of that stuff?
Like how would you feel about that?
Participant 011:
So we're almost about ready to lose it now, there's fires all around my house and oh my God, it's so cloudy out.
I mean, smoky and I had no idea.
I mean we're on number two alert here already because the whole western...
PART 2 OF 4 ENDS
Participant 011:
We're on number two alert here already because the whole Western United States is burning up if you haven't read.
How do I feel about it?
I think I should probably be taking all the paintings off the wall and putting them in a suitcase right now, but [INAUDIBLE] until somebody in my family calls me and tells me I should do it.
So how do I feel about that?
Yeah, I feel awful about it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 011:
But if the fire came and burned my house down here or my two houses that I have, I would lose everything.
I guess be like those people in Paradise who lost everything last year or year before last.
But you start up from ashes again, you grab what you can that's [INAUDIBLE] the living things, which are more important, and probably a couple of most rare paintings, and hope the rest of the stuff the insurance company will give you some money for.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 011:
I mean, that's why we got home insurance, right?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 011:
They never pay you what you think you're going to get from them though.
I know that.
But you can't insure everything.
You can only insure your house up to a certain point.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 011:
So yeah, no, I feel horrible about that, but in a way I'd probably feel relief too.
So, it goes both ways.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 011:
I mean, I'm not going to burn my house down, or if there's a catastrophe here and I'm evacuated and my house does burn down, well, it'll be sad, but I will recover from it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
When it comes to throwing things out, how do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Or what do you discard?
