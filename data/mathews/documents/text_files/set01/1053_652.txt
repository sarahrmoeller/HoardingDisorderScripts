00:03 Interviewer:
Alright, so, as you know, the study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs relating to hoarding disorder. So the first question I want to ask you is, what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter or difficulties discarding?
Participant:
What term... what do you mean?
00:26 Interviewer:
I mean like, are you okay with using hoarding disorder or would you prefer like problems with clutter?
Participant:
Probably since I'm not familiar with the diagnostic criteria of hoarding disorder, I  would say definitely that I have a problem with clutter.
5:00 Interviewer:
Health and hygiene. Okay. Yeah, that's great. Okay, so now we're going to go into a more conversational part of the interview. So I'm just going to ask you a question and you answer it. Just like a conversation. So the first part of the first section is about your behavior and treatment seeking. So could you please describe your own problems with clutter? 
Participant:
Mostly with regard to paperwork and some objects that are sentimental. 
5:39 Interviewer:
Could you elaborate on what are these objects?
Participant:
Objects like dishes or gifts perhaps if someone gave me in the past. Objects that have some sort of emotional charge. 
6:04 Interviewer:
Okay. And how long has this been going on?
Participant:
Oh, probably, you know, for a long time. Probably my whole life.
6:18 Interviewer:
Okay, and how severe would you say this behavior is now?
Participant:
I don't think it could be classified as severe. I think it's more something that’s an irritant or causes me to suffer a certain amount of financial harm because I can't find something, you know, maybe lose a receipt, lose a checkbook, lose something that I need for my taxes- something like that. 
7:05 Interviewer:
Okay, so it's not severe, but it is irritating at times.
Participant:
Yeah. 
7:12 Interviewer:
Okay. And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Participant:
Yeah, it’s a problem. 
7:21 Interviewer:
And have you ever sought to change this behavior like gone to a professional or a counselor?
Participant:
Not for this specifically, not for this behavior specifically- no. 
7:36 Interviewer:
Okay, so not with the clutter problems then.
Participant:
Right. 
7:42 Interviewer:
And how do your family and friends feel about this behavior?
Participant:
I think some of them think I should just, you know, just get over it. Just do it. And that is not helpful. 
8:05 Interviewer:
So do you feel like they don't understand what's going on or...
Participant:
In some cases, yeah. 
8:20 Interviewer:
And have you ever had conflicts with the people close to you or landlords or anyone else about your behavior?
Participant:
No. 
8:29 Interviewer:
Okay, so the next section is about your space and where you live. So could you describe where you live now and do you live alone?
Participant:
I'm in a single family home, and I live with my husband and two dogs.
