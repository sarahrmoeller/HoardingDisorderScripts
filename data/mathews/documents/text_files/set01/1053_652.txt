Interviewer:
Alright, so, as you know, the study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs relating to hoarding disorder.
So the first question I want to ask you is, what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter or difficulties discarding?
Interviewee:
What term... what do you mean?
Interviewer:
I mean like, are you okay with using hoarding disorder or would you prefer like problems with clutter?
Interviewee:
Probably since I'm not familiar with the diagnostic criteria of hoarding disorder, I would say definitely that I have a problem with clutter.
Interviewer:
Health and hygiene.
Okay.
Yeah, that's great.
Okay, so now we're going to go into a more conversational part of the interview.
So I'm just going to ask you a question and you answer it.
Just like a conversation.
So the first part of the first section is about your behavior and treatment seeking.
So could you please describe your own problems with clutter?
Interviewee:
Mostly with regard to paperwork and some objects that are sentimental.
Interviewer:
Could you elaborate on what are these objects?
Interviewee:
Objects like dishes or gifts perhaps if someone gave me in the past.
Objects that have some sort of emotional charge.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And how long has this been going on?
Interviewee:
Oh, probably, you know, for a long time.
Probably my whole life.
Interviewer:
Okay, and how severe would you say this behavior is now?
Interviewee:
I don't think it could be classified as severe.
I think it's more something that’s an irritant or causes me to suffer a certain amount of financial harm because I can't find something, you know, maybe lose a receipt, lose a checkbook, lose something that I need for my taxes- something like that.
Interviewer:
Okay, so it's not severe, but it is irritating at times.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Interviewee:
Yeah, it’s a problem.
Interviewer:
And have you ever sought to change this behavior like gone to a professional or a counselor?
Interviewee:
Not for this specifically, not for this behavior specifically- no.
Interviewer:
Okay, so not with the clutter problems then.
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
And how do your family and friends feel about this behavior?
Interviewee:
I think some of them think I should just, you know, just get over it.
Just do it.
And that is not helpful.
Interviewer:
So do you feel like they don't understand what's going on or...
Interviewee:
In some cases, yeah.
Interviewer:
And have you ever had conflicts with the people close to you or landlords or anyone else about your behavior?
Interviewee:
No.  Interviewer:
Okay, so the next section is about your space and where you live.
So could you describe where you live now and do you live alone?
Interviewee:
I'm in a single family home, and I live with my husband and two dogs.
