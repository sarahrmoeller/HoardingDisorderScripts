Interviewer:
That totally makes sense, I can relate to that.
So when you think about, I know that we talked earlier about the collection of records, when you think about normal saving or collecting, what do you think it is that sets hoarding behavior or over-saving apart from normal saving such as collecting?
Interviewee:
You're asking a tough question here for me.
I think it's realism.
It's thinking what is really possible, what is really pie-in-the-sky versus saying no. In other words, saying no is something that is hard for me to do.
Setting limits.
I think the whole thing is not setting limits.
Interviewer:
So it's about realistic, having a realistic picture of your own limits, as much as anything else.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Then being willing to say, "That would be nice, but the sacrifice is too great."
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
So it's about having a realistic view of what can be achieved and being able to say, "Okay, that might be a nice project for someone someday, but I don't think I'm going to actually be able to do that."
Interviewee:
Yes.
