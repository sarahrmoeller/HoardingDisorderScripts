Interviewer:
Okay. Okay. So, the first question before we get started is that ...
So, now you know that this is investigating individuals and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.
And so our first question is, what term would you prefer we use when you're talking about your difficulties with clutter, and difficulties discarding?
Interviewee49:
What term would I prefer?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Interviewee49:
You can call it anything you want.
You can call it "hoarding."
Interviewer:
Hoarding?
Okay.
Interviewee49:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
All right.
Interviewee49:
I'm not going to be insulted by anything.
There no terms that are ...
Yeah.
Interviewer:
All right.
And then, the next few questions are kind of just basic demographic questions.
And so, we're just going to start off, what is your sex?
Interviewee49:
Female.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And then, you identify as male or female?
Interviewee49:

And then, what is your highest degree of education?
Interviewee49:
I have two bachelor's and a master's, and part of another master's.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And then, what is your approximate household income?
It can be a range.
So I have like 35,000 to 50,000, 50,000 to 100,000 ...
Interviewee49:
You're not going to believe this, but I have no idea.
Since I retired, I haven't paid attention.
So just use that first, 35 to 50.
It's probably something like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
All right, that's fine.
And then, which geographic region best describes where you live in the US?
Like northeast, Midwest, south, or west?
Interviewee49:
Northeast.
Interviewer:
Okay.
All right.
So, that was all of our free listing prompts that we have.
And so this next section is going to be more conversation-style, and it's separated into five main sections that we're going to talk about.
And so, this first one is going to be talking about behavior and treatment-seeking.
And so, first question is, if you could please describe your hoarding disorder and how long it's been going on?
Interviewee49:
I think when I was a kid, I always kept stuff, but I could eventually spend a Saturday in my room and clean it up.
And as I got older, I had ...
I've always lived alone, so I was never neat.
But again, in my apartment for the first few years, I could clean it up so that I could have company for dinner the next weekend or something like that.
I could get stuff put away enough to have a living room and a dining room and a kitchen that I could entertain.
