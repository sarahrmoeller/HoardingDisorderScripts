Interviewee:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Okay.
What would you say is the most precious item in your house for you?
Interviewee:
Probably my teddy bear that sings Que Sera Sera.
It was my mom's.
I had given it to my mom.
Sometimes they would get her up and stuff by playing the bear because then she would get happy and stuff so she wouldn't fight them.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
I understand why that would be precious to you for sure.
What would happen if you lost it?
Interviewee:
At this point, if I lost it I would be real upset for a while but I know I'd get over it because she had other things too.
She had bears that I had given her that I recorded messages on if you hugged it.
That stuff, those I never got back.
And I obviously went through it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
You'd be upset at first, for sure, but you know that it's something, okay, eventually, I'll be okay, I can get over it?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Yeah.
What's considered trash for you?
How do you decide to discard it?
Interviewee:
Like catalogues, I guess, for clothing and stuff.
I always look for the dates of when something expires so when it expires I can throw it away.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
But it's like, I might have a catalouge that's going to expire at the end of this month and I know that I'm not going to go buy something from there before that but I still can't get rid of it until that actual date.
Interviewer:
Basically, when something's expired you know, "Okay, I can't do anything with this" then you're okay with discarding it?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Okay.
Thinking about your home and your things, do you think that you have too much stuff?
If so, how do you know?
Interviewee:
Yes.
I think I have, for one thing, too many clothes because I have severe kyphoscoliosis, which is why I'm in a wheelchair.
I am bent to the side and forward and my waist does not align with my hips so I have to get clothes that ...
It's hard to find clothes that fit that ... I used to have pants with drawstrings but then I found that skirts work better.
I ended up buying skirts and dresses.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
I still haven't gotten rid of all the pants.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Would you say that you might decide that you have too much when there is an abundance of things that you don't use anymore?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
If you had to choose between your items, what kind of process would you do to choose?
How would you choose between things?
Interviewee:
If somebody told me, you have a choice, you've got to get rid of everything but five skirts or whatever, I would choose the ones that I had worn the most recently.
