Interviewer: Okay, so before we get started, I just wanted to ask you what term you prefer when we're discussing issues with clutter or hoarding, if there is a term you prefer.
Interviewee:
Clutter.
Interviewer: Okay, so that's going to conclude the first little part of our interview.
The second part is going to be more like a casual conversation, where we're just going to, you know, talk a little bit about your particular experience, and everything like that.
So, I’m going to start off by asking you to describe your clutter problems.
How long has this been going on?
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer: Right.
So—
Interviewee:
So, obviously, you know, as far back as, you know, not being able to keep my room tidy as a child.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, when you were a child, what did that look like?
Interviewee:
Clothes on the floor, toys not put up.
Um, some of my earliest memories though are, you know, my, my father, who, you know, would have a stack of things on a table next to him.
It wasn't exactly the, the modeling that, you know, I mean, I, I kind of feel like I know where I learned it from.
Um, you know, the garage that was always overflowing, and, um, you know the table that always had a ton of books on it or whatever.
Um, it just wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't very— the home wasn't very tidy.
Um, but then I wasn't either so.
Interviewer: So, you witnessed a lot of similar behavior in your father then?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
And so, I know you said that he kind of kept like a cluttered garage, and things on like his nightstand.
Um, but can you kind of go into a little bit more detail about what his clutter looked like?
Interviewee:
It was just, it was just, you know, a mishmash.
A pile of, you know, books and papers and, um, things like— I guess the best way to describe it would be, my husband was raised in a place that everything had its place.
I mean, that was, my father-in-law was very much like that.
And in my house, nothing had a place.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
Interviewee:
It was, it was wherever you put it.
That was the place.
Interviewer: Alright.
And now in your adult life, how severe would you say that your own behavior is?
Interviewee:
It's pretty, it's pretty bad.
Um, you know, I have, I have recurring fantasies of, you know, being a genie.
Being able to blink my eyes and just have my space clean.
Interviewer: Right.
