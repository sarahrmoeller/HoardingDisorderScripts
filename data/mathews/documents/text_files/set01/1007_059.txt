Interviewer:
But after that, do you, maybe, read a lot? I know you mentioned you like puzzles, do you have a large collection of puzzles?
Participant 007:
I do have a lot of puzzles. The problem with reading is I had cataract surgery and lenses replaced. I'm extremely near-sighted, but I never had trouble reading. Now, I have trouble sitting down and reading. They were not able to correct my stigmatism, so even with correcting reading glasses, it's uncomfortable for me to read, and that drives me nuts. That is just a heartbreak for me because I used to read incessantly. I was an avid reader and, now, it's uncomfortable and it's not a wonderful thing, and that breaks my heart most of all.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I'm very hard to hear that. That sounds like its been very difficult for you. So, then, you're mostly just using your computers and puzzles, you'd say?
Participant 007:
Yes, I would say so.
Interviewer:
Okay. Again, when you think about all your possessions, what makes them valuable? How do you determine when an object is valuable or not?
Participant 007:
I guess sentimentality is one and then, it's like finding a plan, I know the whole idea of taking a picture of something and then you can preserve it, but then I have to think, well I take a picture of it, and then I have to identify it. Then I have to take the picture and then I take things to snap this, which is one of the... you can make photo books and things. So, I have all of these plans. "Oh, I'm going to do that," so my kids and my grandkids can look back on family history and see all of this. Then I just don't click because it has to be perfect.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 007:
It has to be just right and if I can't get it just right, then I get frustrated and I stop, because it isn't perfect.
Interviewer:
One way you value objects is based on their memory associated or the sentimentality of that object?
Participant 007:
Yes. Sentimentality and perceived usability, either immediate or possible future use of the living, which is where I really get into trouble. CROSSTALK How can you be of use some day and, then, some day comes and you either forget you have it or you can't find it.
