Interviewer:
Just the list for now, we could always go into it I think CROSSTALK it'll probably come up later.
Participant 37:
Yeah I think I would say [INAUDIBLE] the question is why do I collect, right?
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
Okay so, I'm a little under rested but I should be okay and what did I say?
Interviewer:
You said to remind you of an event so far.
Participant 37:
Okay, right and...[INAUDIBLE] some other...why do I collect?
I guess I do like, I do appreciate, some of the beauty in some of the things I collect.
So I like [INAUDIBLE] art and various kinds of art.
I think I have a feeling that I want to be able to go back to that thing, even if it's a book.
So while I read the book [INAUDIBLE] always be there for me.
So, maybe preventing a loss of the experience.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So just saving it for later just in case, or?
Participant 37:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay so reminding you of an event, appreciation of beauty, and preventing a loss of experience or being able to go back to it sounds like that's your list.
Participant 37:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, that's great.
Okay, the next question's a little bit different.
So, please list all the ways that a person could identify someone with hoarding disorder.
Participant 37:
Okay.
A messy home space...maybe someone who doesn't pay attention to their appearance because they're more concerned about all their things.
Someone who is more self-centered, perhaps.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
And someone who talks about their collecting.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, you've mentioned messy space, someone who doesn't pay attention as much to their appearance, someone who may be self-centered or someone who talks about their collecting.
Participant 37:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Those are great.
Okay, would that complete your list?
Participant 37:
I guess, I feel [INAUDIBLE] speak from my experience and perhaps my mother and my brother.
Well one thing I guess that my brother does, he's fairly inquisitive and he is talking about the things that he keeps getting.
So, was that part of...that's talking about the collecting so that's pretty much it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
All right.
So, our last listing question is, please list all of the reasons that people may want to seek treatment for hoarding.
Participant 37:
If it takes over their life, if they want to have more personal connections and their collections or collecting is keeping them from getting to that point, running out of money, and did I say running out of space?
Interviewer:
No, that's another one.
Participant 37:
And running out of space, no more room on the bookshelves.
I think that's probably about it.
Interviewer:
Okay, so taking over life, wanting to make more personal connections, running out of money and space.
So that completes your list?
Participant 37:
Yeah.
