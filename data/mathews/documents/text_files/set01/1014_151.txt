Interviewer:
And how did you react to that?
Participant 014:
Well, I didn't know what they threw away until once I asked him where the box of t-shirts were that the kids had used when they belonged to this organizations through school, I saved like a hundred of them and I was going to make a quilt out of them.
Interviewer:
Oh, that's cute when they do that.
Participant 014:
So I said, "Where are the kids t-shirts?" And he said, "Oh, it went out with the dump truck."
And I was mad at him for quite a while for that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And could you please describe where you live now?
Participant 014:
We're in a ranch house and I have a veterinary practice in the downstairs, in the walkout basement.
And we live upstairs and our kids are all out of the house, so we have one, two, three bedrooms, and nobody that nobody is living in.
So we have a lot of stuff stored there.
But like I said, since this quarantine, my husband's been going through a lot of the stuff in the rooms that we've been storing so we're cleaning it up a little bit at a time.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And is it easy for you to make your way throughout the house?
Participant 014:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And how important are your things for you to feel at home?
Participant 014:
Pretty important.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And which objects are the most important to you?
Participant 014:
Pictures.
I don't have a very good memory so I take pictures of everything.
I have over a hundred photo albums.
Interviewer:
Oh wow.
Participant 014:
So I've got them all lined up on shelves and various places.
So the pictures are the most important thing to me.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So the pictures are the most important?
Participant 014:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
And are there parts of your home specifically that you would consider cluttered?
Participant 014:
Well, the two back rooms where nobody is sleeping in them anymore is where we keep most of the boxes.
And the garage, the garage is very cluttered still, even though we had those dump trucks take several loads out, it's still cluttered.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And are they cluttered just because there's a lot of boxes in them?
Participant 014:
Boxes and boxes.
When my kids were growing up, every time we had a party, company for their bar and bat mitzvahs, I would haul out things into the garage so the house would look neater.
So the garage, everything built up in the garage.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
And I know that you mentioned that the two back rooms that aren't being used anymore since your kids moved out.
Are there other parts of your home that you don't use the way they were intended to be used?
Participant 014:
No, mainly it's the back bedrooms and the garage.
