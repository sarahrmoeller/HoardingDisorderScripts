Interviewee:
Well, like right now, I'm sitting at my table that I use as a desk and it's covered with papers, my sewing kit, headphones, my music books.
If I want to find something, I have to sift through things.
My closet has, I mean, literally you have a little pathway to get to the back of the closet.
I have stored at either end of... I have a huge closet space that's in the attic and it's stuffed with things now that this...
The clothes that I need to get to right away I can get to, but I'm stepping over some shoes or things like that that might be on the floor.
And then, my garage, there's a couple of rooms that you can't hardly get into because it's so full of things.
The laundry room you can get in and out of but there's stuff stuffed in the corners and things I haven't looked at in years.
Interviewer:
Is-
Interviewee:
So...
Yeah?
Interviewer:
Is everything all in boxes or is it in bags?
Interviewee:
Some of it's in boxes, some of it's in water proof boxes, then other things get stuffed because what happens is I have somebody come do some work on the house and I just have to get rid of some things in a hurry so I shove things back into an empty corner.
So, there's a mixture of storage boxes, and then in the tool room there's buckets of tools and there's old paint and there's all kinds of stuff like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
But you can still access your bathroom and your kitchen?
Interviewee:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, my public rooms, people would not think I have a problem.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, the only room that you're maybe not using for it's intended purpose would be the garage, because you don't like park your cars in there, you just use it for storage?
Interviewee:
Yes, I can park my car in there.
Interviewer:
Oh, you can?
Interviewee:
Oh, yeah.
I've always been able to park my car in the garage, but the garage... the garage, just beyond the length of the car is there's a bunch of stuff, the left and the right side of the car there's a bunch of stuff stacked up.
But I can get the car in the garage, I can get out and get into the house.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, it's more like you just have a lot of storage spaces but the things that you need to access you can still access?
Interviewee:
Yeah, like my car and things, but it's like...
I'll say this, it's embarrassing, I can't find the pink slip for my car.
It's somewhere.
I know I remember getting it, but I don't know where it went, so.
