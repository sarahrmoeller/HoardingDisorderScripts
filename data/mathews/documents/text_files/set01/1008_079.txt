Interviewer:
Okay. Okay, the last one.
John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.
He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.
He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.
Antiques occupy every room.
Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.
Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet.
So, he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.
He is almost always late in getting where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
What do you think about this person?
Participant 008:
Definitely disorder.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 008:
Again, having trouble functioning with basic daily stuff.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Okay.
So now, our last section is on COVID.
So, I just want to know how COVID has impacted your life, just generally, and also your hoarding?
Have you seen an increase in your acquiring, maybe because you can't ...
You have more time on your hands, or it's an anxious time.
Or have you been able to spend the time throwing more items out?
Just tell me about where you're at with that?
Participant 008:
I work from home.
So, it hasn't had a big impact.
The biggest is probably social.
I haven't been able to see my friends in person.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 008:
Go out to eat.
But we've got several ... I got a couple elderly in laws and my mom.
So, they want to see their grandkids.
We're pretty careful, as far as trying not to get sick ourselves by exposing them to it.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, it hasn't ...
Sorry.
Go ahead.
Participant 008:
As far as hoarding ...
Interviewer:
Yeah?
Participant 008:
I think that initially it doesn't ...
We didn't hoard any toilet paper or anything like that, but we probably did buy more stuff for the kid ...
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
Participant 008:
... At first, you know, online, than we might have otherwise in the sense of now we're trapped in the house, and we've got to entertain ...
He's now 18 months, 19 months.
But it's like, let's get a playground set for the back yard, and let's get ...
You know, just for him, enough for him.
After that initial wave, if anything, it's kind of the other way.
There's a little more time to look at stuff and to find things to get rid of.
Interviewer:
Totally.
Okay.
So, it hasn't really affected your hoarding as much?
Maybe just getting some stuff for your child, since you felt they had to be entertained more.
Participant 008:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
But really, it's the social stuff that you feel has had the biggest impact?
Participant 008:
Yeah, absolutely.
