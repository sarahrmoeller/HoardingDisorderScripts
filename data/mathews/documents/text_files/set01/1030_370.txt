Interviewee:
Well I did make some progress at first.
One of the things that I would do, if you go to a play or a concert, there's a program, and usually there's a lot of interesting information about the performers or the composer, and all of that, and I start reading it during the intermission, but then I always take it home and think I'm going to finish reading it later, it's really interesting.
And then of course, I don't so I did throw out a whole stack of things like that.
Like theater programs and concert programs, when they first started the quarantine.
I did get rid of a lot of stuff like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How about...
Sorry, go ahead.
Interviewee:
I was just going to say that I think I went through a flurry of that, but then after that, it's like now I've kind of distracted to other things.
Interviewer:
Right, right.
How about your sense of connectedness or the attachment you have to your items, do you think it's been strengthened because of COVID or weakened?
Interviewee:
I don't think it's...
Well it definitely hasn't been strengthened, and I don't know that it's been weakened.
I think a lot of it is...
It's easy to say, "I just don't have time to sit down and go through things."
And that's not really true.
I think I could make the time.
I think it's painful to have to sit down and have to keep making decision after decision.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
I know you said it helped you declutter in the beginning, and you had a little bit more time for organizing in the beginning.
Now I just want to know a little bit about your overall physical health.
Have you been impacted at all, physically, by COVID?
Interviewee:
No. I actually, I'm pretty overweight, and I actually have lost weight since then.
I think...
Well maybe because I'm not going out.
If you're just eating at home, it's easy to eat right.
So I haven't noticed any negative health effects.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How about in your mental health, your wellbeing?
Interviewee:
No, actually, mentally I don't think it's effected me at all.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How about how it's effected your family financially, if at all?
Interviewee:
It hasn't effected us at all.
