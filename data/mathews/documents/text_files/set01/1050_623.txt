Participant 50:
Right.
So sometimes I feel like I can't even do hoarding correctly.
I'm good at delegating work things and stuff like that.
But the part about, I feel like I could do it if I had the availability are just pull everything out of one room and go back in it and then put it back and then destroy whatever I don't need and do the three bosses or whatever.
So I haven't quite figured that out yet on how to do that.
But I desperately want to do that.
I desperately want to be better.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like hoarding disorder is stigmatized?
Participant 50:
Oh yeah.
Definitely, because of the fact that they put it on the show, they wouldn't put it schizophrenia on the show and make it into a prime time TV show.
Yeah.
Let's go ahead and chill, let's be a mass killer.
Let's go to mercy kill people and then let's see if we can help them.
So then it's like because like I hear people talking because they don't know if you have an issue with it and they're saying how disgusting their relative is and how could they live like that?
And so that's the one person that you're not going to come by then as you listen to them and stuff like that.
Interviewer:
Absolutely.
Sure.
Participant 50:
Yeah.
I just think it's just not necessarily looked into, but people have trivialized the issue because of the fact that it's like part of the mainstream culture to have it on television so it comes into people's homes.
So it's trivialized.
Interviewer:
Definitely.
And what do you think of when you hear people talking about hoarding disorder?
Do you think of your own behavior or do you think of the television show?
What springs to mind?
Participant 50:
Well because it depends on if they're talking about somebody else and it all of a sudden has me feeling like we need to circle in a little bit and protect myself around that person.
That if they're talking about the issue itself, then I might offer my two cents then about it.
Sometimes the person can't help it or whatever like that.
But it depends on how it's being discussed.
Interviewer:
So sometimes it makes you feel like you have to protect yourself because you don't want to be kind of lumped in to whatever it is they're talking about.
But other times you feel like it's safer for you to kind of stick your head up and say "Wow, it's really not their fault.'
Participant 50:
Yeah.
But it's not that you don't want to be lumped in.
It's like prejudice in the sense that it's listening to people that don't have a final reference talking about it.
