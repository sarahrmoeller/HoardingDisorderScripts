Interviewer:
Have the people living with you changed?
It sounds like your daughters came home for a time?
Participant 26:
Yeah she's a medical student, and so she was home for four months because they didn't have enough PPE to go around.
But the called them back on July 6th, so she's back now.
Sorry?
Interviewer:
So your daughter was there for a period of time during the quarantine but is no longer there?
Participant 26:
Correct, although we did go down to see her last week and we spent about four or five days with her which was very nice.
Interviewer:
That's nice, yeah.
Have you been able to be successful in keeping in contact with family and friends?
Participant 26:
I have been, I haven't really seen them but we text a lot, we talk on the phone, I've got four siblings.
Interviewer:
That's wonderful.
Participant 26:
So we're all pretty close.
Interviewer:
That's great.
And do you feel like you haven't been particularly isolated or lonely during this time period?
Participant 26:
No I never ever, ever feel lonely.
Interviewer:
That's wonderful.
Participant 26:
I like being alone, I really enjoy my space.
But when I need the company there's always somebody there, family or friends, my husband is very supportive and hands on.
Interviewer:
That totally makes sense.
So it sounds like you have been able to actually be really close with your family during this time and it's not something that normally gets to you anyway to be alone?
Participant 26:
Right, right.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you have found a lot of times to do things that you've been meaning to do and to enjoy a little bit, the space to concentrate on yourself?
Participant 26:
Yeah I mean I have to say mornings were always so difficult for me, but now I can't wait to get up.
Interviewer:
That's wonderful.
Participant 26:
I have never been a morning person, I would work into the wee hours and then just, "Oh gosh, it's eight o'clock, I'll sleep until nine."
And now I look at the clock and it's five o'clock and I think, "It's a little too early to start my day."
Interviewer:
That's wonderful, were you working prior to COVID?
Participant 26:
No, no I was not.
Interviewer:
But it's just kind of kept you centered it sounds like, just to be home?
Participant 26:
Yeah there's a lot to keep me busy here.
Interviewer:
That's wonderful.
Participant 26:
I do my own gardening, I clean my own house like I mentioned, I don't want people touching my stuff.
I tried having a housekeeper, I was ready to have a nervous breakdown.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like you've taken pleasure in your space?
Participant 26:
I do, I really enjoy it, yeah.
