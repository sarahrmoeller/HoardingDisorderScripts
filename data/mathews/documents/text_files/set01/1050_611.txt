Participant 50:
It was good. I got some pointers and some of the things I still do but it's sort of like something that because what I find is if I can get one habit right now, I never usually have to struggle finding my kids anymore because I have a sub. So if I can find a pattern of being then it seems to keep me on the straight and narrow. Some of the things I've picked up, I felt were really good. It's just like if but that particular class was taken over by somebody who I was being in treatment at the same time I was in the group. So I felt like I could have progressed faster, but she took up a lot of the time or it's like, she had an excuse for not getting better. And so we spent a lot of times talking about her and her inability to throw away things. And even though it was progress, it was very detrimental to her own self.
Interviewer:
So it ended up being kind of group therapy for her rather than for everyone.
Participant 50:
Yeah. But the people did try to encourage her that she did need to seek help outside of the group for the issues that were stopping her from even hearing what they were trying to tell.
Interviewer:
And she kind of derailed the group overall and that hurt your experience.
Participant 50:
Yeah. So it ended up where it was just me and her and the two counselors. And two people just dropped out, but one person I don't think dropped out because of her, but the other one, I'm pretty sure did.
Interviewer:
Can you talk a little bit about how you think that your hoarding problems have impacted your life socially?
Participant 50:
Most of my friends either I've told them or they have seen it progressed enough where they understand why they can't come over. And it's sort of one of those things where I feel like certain people, I definitely can't share or can't. I have to try to figure out a way that they can't find out because of things that they've said. I know that they would not see me the same or either want to continue to be my friends, if that makes sense. So I used to be a very social person where I used to love to have parties and things like that. And that has changed the part of me where I don't have those things that I used to have. But I'm not lacking in friends or friendship. It's just depends on what's going on and whether I'm just trying to survive as opposed to just get better.
Interviewer:
Whether you really feel up to it. Sure if you feel up to it.
