Participant 49:
Yeah. If they just came, you know like they do on the TV show ... I haven't seen it in years, but the hoarding shows where they come in and just move stuff out? That would bother me. But the thing that works is with my friend that does come help me and I pay her. She's an employee when we're working on the house.
But she knows the things that she should not get rid of, and the things she should be looking out for. And I trust her totally. I know her well enough that I think if things are gone when she's picking up stuff and choosing trash, and we have the piles that, "This, you're going to keep," so that's the stuff in the dining room, and "This is trash and this is giveaway or ..." Well, the trash goes with the recycling, but then there's a whole set of giveaway stuff.
And we just have a working relationship, but she seems to have a sense of what I might want to give away or not. And if she doesn't know, she asks me, and I know she will ask me. And the other thing that's really good is, at the end of the day, she has a big SUV, and she takes trash and the giveaways with her, which is helpful.
One, to get them out of the house. And two, you can't decide, "Well, maybe I'll keep that after all." And fortunately, I don't have any problem when it's out of here. It might be a book or something, some item that, "Huh, I maybe wish I had that." And then I, in my own head, can say, "Oh, come on. You have so much. You never even knew you had it." 
So I can be somewhat ... I'm in denial, the way I act, by staying up in my little room. But I'm not in denial as far as, "This is too much stuff. We have got to do something. Let's get some reality here." So, I have that on my side. I'm not totally insane. Just partially.
Interviewer:
I wouldn't say you're insane.
Participant 49:
Well, you haven't seen the house.
Interviewer:
That's fair. So, I'm very curious. When she comes over, are you with her the whole time that she's going through stuff? Or do you go off on your own and work on a different part of the house? How does that work? Because you mentioned that she kind of knows, so I'm just curious.
Participant 49:
We do a mixture. That's a good question, because we started out with a plan ... Most of it's so close in time. I said, "We've first got to be able to get in the entryway, so let's just ..." And it took us two days to really clear out the entryway. I have no idea how efficient all my stacks and piles were. Some of them were.
