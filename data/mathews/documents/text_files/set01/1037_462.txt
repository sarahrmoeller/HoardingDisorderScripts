Interviewee37:
Does it upset me?
Well, I guess the part that I would say upsets me is having difficulties with throwing out.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee37:
I wouldn't say that it's... I guess it causes stress to do it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So discarding.
Interviewee37:
Yeah and I mean part of it is knowing that I'm never going to use it but still not wanting to put it in the garbage can.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Interviewee37:
Only to the extent where the garage became the way it was.
If the garage doesn't go in the downward direction and my upstairs goes in the upward direction of having less things then I think I'm on the right path.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So now we're going to move into two remaining sections about the Covid pandemic.
Interviewee37:
Okay.
Interviewer:
How has COVID-19 impacted your life?
Interviewee37:
Well, initially we went out and hoarded food.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee37:
Hopefully in a practical way we tried to buy enough food for a period of time.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee37:
It means I almost never go to a store so, not that I was doing any kind of buying that was in the hoarding sphere... give me the question again?
Interviewer:
No, that was good.
How has covid impacted your life?
So you go to the less, of course.
Interviewee37:
We go to the store less.
So, initially we were going infrequently.
We, I guess, learned that things have changed the way people are shopping [INAUDIBLE] semi-normal.
We're very careful, we don't see people as easily.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee37:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Has covid affected your difficulties with discarding or has it been more or less the same?
Interviewee37:
It's maybe been easier because I have more time to do that.
I mean the garage was a real work.
We really spent hours getting stuff out of there and there's still stuff, it's not 100% done but it's at a point where it's livable.
Interviewer:
So, would you say covid has had a positive effect in your attempts to declutter?
Interviewee37:
Yeah, for practical reasons, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Has covid impacted your overall physical health?
Interviewee37:
No. No, I mean if anything I've... depending on the weather, when the weather was really good I was exercising more.
Interviewer:
Oh. Interviewee37:
Because I couldn't do my normal exercises where I had a sort of regular routine so I became a little bit more active.
Interviewer:
Well that's good.
Interviewee37:
So I think I'm maybe healthier but [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay, and has covid affected your overall mental health or well-being?
Interviewee37:
No, it's just a pain in the neck... I worry more when I'm not in my safe space at home.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee37:
If I go to store I'm a little concerned because I'd rather not.
