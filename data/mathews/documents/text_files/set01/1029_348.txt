Interviewer:
Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without necessarily being in their home or the area that is cluttered?
Participant 29:
Well, like I said about if someone won't let you into their home, is that what you mean?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 29:
Yeah.
Like if someone won't let you in, or ...
Just what you can observe from the outside, I guess.
I mean, I don't think you can tell just looking at an individual, I'd say if you're walking on the street, I don't think I can say, "Oh, that's a hoarder."
Unless they're really a shopping INAUDIBLE.
So I don't think that I can tell.
I don't think they're necessarily sloppy, dirty people.
I think somehow, even the ones whose homes are horrific, manage to clean themselves up.
So I would say, other than what you can observe from outside, no. And the fact that they don't even invite you over to their house.
Or, if you go to the door, and I had this happen to me, like they kind of squeeze through the front door to get outside to talk to you, so that you can't see anything inside.
It's like, "Boy, I wonder if that person has a hoarding disorder?"
Interviewer:
Did you wonder that?
Did that thought ever come to mind before you were diagnosed?
Participant 29:
Oh, I don't know if I was ever diagnosed, I think I'm self-diagnosed.
Interviewer:
Before you started using the words hoarding disorder, thinking of yourself in that manner.
Did you ever think of others in that way?
Participant 29:
... I'm trying to really think if ...
Probably not.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 29:
I'm just thinking I might not have even been very aware of it, until I saw television programs on hoarding.
And I probably never gave it any thought before that.
Interviewer:
So the main source of information that you've had on hoarding seems like it's been TV, right?
Participant 29:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Anywhere else that you've heard about it?
Participant 29:
I've probably read articles on it after that.
Like always trying to deal with this little issue of mine, if I might come across an article in a magazine or online, I would read something about it.
I read a lot of organizing articles, and there's a overlap there.
Interviewer:
A little bit, yes.
...
Okay.
That ends most of the questions that I have regarding hoarding disorders specifically.
Do you have any final thought, or any questions that really got you thinking further?
Participant 29:
I think that I've been kind of interjecting whenever something comes up.
Interviewer:
You have, I appreciate that.
Participant 29:
What I will say is, as feedback, I really like your reflections back on things.
I think you've done an excellent job interviewing and really synthesizing everything that I was saying.
So that made me very comfortable.
So I wanted to say that.
It made it easy.
