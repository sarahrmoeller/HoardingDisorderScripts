Interviewer:
Yeah, it's like decision making.
Participant 32:
And makes the decisions, yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah, exactly.
I'm a psych major so I understand what you're saying.
Participant 32:
Okay, yeah.
Interviewer:
And so, you said that you've gone to classes but have you gone to a professional like a psychologist or a psychiatrist or anything?
Participant 32:
Not about this, about clutter or hoarding.
About other things but not about this, yeah.
Interviewer:
And why do you think you haven't gone for clutter or hoarding?
Participant 32:
I guess because I just didn't think it was that big of a deal to talk to a professional about.
Like thinking that it's something that would be so easy to fix but a decade would go by without my fixing it.
So, "Ahem.
Participant 32, wake up."
Interviewer:
Okay.
And how do your family and friends feel about your behavior?
Participant 32:
I don't notice my family noticing it or saying anything particularly about it because I don't see my family very often.
But my friends, local friends, who are aware of it occasionally...
Well, I think they feel for me.
They feel sorry that I have this problem and occasionally they give me suggestions and sometimes offer to help me in the declutter process.
Interviewer:
Okay, and how do you feel about those suggestions?
Do you welcome them or do you feel like it's not their place?
Participant 32:
Well, I love the idea of it but I don't say yes to it because I'm fearful that it will cause a rift in my relationship with them because I'm fearful of my reaction to what they say or suggest.
So yeah, I just don't want to do it that way.
Interviewer:
That's fair because...
So, it sounds like you want to avoid conflict.
Participant 32:
Yeah, for sure.
I did... I will say when I moved... I sold the house, yeah, almost three years ago now.
And I thought I had a perfect opportunity to be decluttering and organizing and all that and I gave carload after carload of stuff away to a humane society thrift shop and I even hired an organizer.
I think I had her out for two or three different days for parts of those days to help me go through things.
And so, she was somebody I did not know and so that seemed to go fine.
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay.
So, it was because there wasn't that personal relationship that you were okay with getting help from someone else?
Participant 32:
Yes, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay, and have you ever had conflicts in the past with people close to you or your landlords about your behavior?
Participant 32:
No, no I haven't.
Interviewer:
Okay, and so now we're moving on to section two, which is about space and living area.
So, could you please describe where you live now?
