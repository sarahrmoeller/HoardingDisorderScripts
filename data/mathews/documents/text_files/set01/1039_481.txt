Interviewee:
Sometimes, I feel like, which is kind of bad, I must say that when people ask me what do I think about the COVID or about the pandemic, I've been asked enough times by people, say on the telephone that I'm starting to feel guilty.
I feel like somehow or other I'm living apart from everybody else and that is the truth.
I feel like I'm living in this bubble in this life that is very protective and all these other poor people are having to cope with it.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
I'm not having to cope.
A part of me feels kind of guilty.
Interviewer:
Well, that's nice that you feel guilty, right?
But I think that you can't control how you feel.
It makes sense given everything, given you're less social, given you can work at your home and write.
Makes sense that hasn't changed a lot.
I have one more question, has it changed, is there more conflict between you and your partner with COVID or are you guys dealing with it pretty well?
Interviewee:
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.
Interviewer:
Has it caused any tension or anything between you and your partner or have you guys been able to deal with it okay?
Interviewee:
We're dealing with it okay.
Interviewer:
That's great.
Oh, good.
Okay.
So that's all that I have for you.
