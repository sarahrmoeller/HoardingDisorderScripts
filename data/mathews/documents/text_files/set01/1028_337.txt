Interviewer:
Okay. Sounds like, yeah, you've had a lot of different exposure to areas where it might come up in your life.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I also live in rural Montana.
There are yards in my neighborhood and beyond of people who I could label as hoarders because I can drive past their yard or see garbage stacked up around their house, things like that, and then I go, "Oh, good, I'm not a bad hoarder compared to them."
But it's not like I live in a nice neighborhood where you don't have as many opportunities to see hoarding.
We see it here.
People save things.
Not everybody, but here and there, you can see it more.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
I don't know, I haven't lived in the city for a long time.
Maybe it's not more.
Interviewer:
I wonder.
I wouldn't necessarily know how you'd tell know, if you can't see someone's yard or their space as openly.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I mean, when I was growing up, my dad is a hoarder but inside the house.
Nobody could tell by looking at the house, you know, and that's my impression of my neighborhood where I grew up.
You couldn't tell if anyone was a hoarder by looking because everybody took care of the outside of their house to some degree so that they wouldn't stick out too much, I guess.
Yeah, anyways.
Interviewer:
That is interesting.
Let me look through and see.
We've talked about a lot of different things, and it's a lot easier to have these interviews and have them be more of a discussion where we kind of go from idea to idea, but then I have to go back and check and make sure we've covered most of our bases.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
That's a job for you.
Interviewer:
And I think the only questions I'm really left with us what items in your house do you consider to be the most valuable, and what do you think would happen if you were to lose or have to discard these items?
Interviewee:
Hm. That may be the most thought provoking thing you've asked me.
Interviewer:
I had to end with a big one.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I guess the things that are not actually replaceable that elicit memories certainly are the most valuable, I think.
I mean, I'm looking around in my living room and dining room kitchen here, and everything is replaceable other than my original drawings which, I'm kind of tired of them right now.
But when I think of my garage, where I have boxes of driftwood from different trips to the ocean, I mean, that just sounds crazy.
That would be so sad to lose those.
They have no monetary value whatsoever.
Interviewer:
Well, it's been pretty apparent that monetary value, that's the least important characteristic.
