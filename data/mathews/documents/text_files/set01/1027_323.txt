Interviewee:
Okay. Go ahead.
Sorry.
Interviewer:
No, no, that's okay.
How old are you?
Interviewee:
I'll be 74 in two weeks.
Interviewer:
Okay, so very close.
Happy early birthday.
Interviewee:
Thank you.
We're celebrating it at the North Pole.
Interviewer:
At the North Pole?
Interviewee:
Yeah, we leave Tuesday.
Interviewer:
That is very exciting.
I hope you enjoy your trip.
Interviewee:
Thank you.
Yeah, we went to Antarctica and now we're going to to the Arctic.
Interviewer:
Pole to pole, wow.
That's impressive.
Interviewee:
Pole to pole and around the world, that's the goal.
The only thing left we have to do is staying in Africa, which we're doing on a clipper ship in April.
Interviewer:
Oh, very cool.
That's very exciting.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
What is your highest level of education that you've achieved?
Interviewee:
I have two degrees.
I have a teaching degree, bachelor's, and a nursing degree, bachelor's.
I call that bachelor's plus two because I already had the first two years of undergrad, so I just needed to do the nursing courses.
Interviewer:
Then your sex assigned at birth?
Interviewee:
Female.

Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Then what race do you identify as?
Interviewee:
Caucasian, white.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Non Hispanic?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
You already knew the next question I was going to ask you.
I think it's fairly standard.
Then just as a range, just a general number, about what is your household income?
I can give you some ranges if that helps?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Household income because I have Jerry living with me, do you want his too or just mine?
Interviewer:
If you consider it as a combined income, then you can combine both?
Interviewee:
I'll ask him.
INAUDIBLE.
Interviewer:
He said, yes, I can consider the two.
170,000.
Interviewee:
Okay, perfect.
Interviewer:
All righty.
I just have a few more questions to make sure I get your...
Interviewee:
We're spending on traveling and hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay.
