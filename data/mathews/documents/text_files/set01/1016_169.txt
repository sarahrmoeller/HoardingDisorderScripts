Participant 16:
And then rather quickly I would realize that things really don't matter in life.
What matters in life are my connections to people who love me and care about me.
That's what's important.
Interviewer:
So it would be CROSSTALK.
Participant 16:
And that could go on.
Interviewer:
Okay, so it would be an initial shock and feeling overwhelmed.
Participant 16:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And then you would come to your logic and be like, it's the connections that matter and not the objects that represent those connections.
Participant 16:
Exactly.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And do you think you have too much stuff?
Participant 16:
Oh, I know I have too much stuff.
Interviewer:
How do you decide when you have too much, or how do you know?
Participant 16:
I don't have duplicates of things except on rare occasions I'll buy a peanut butter when I already had two jars in the pantry, but normally I don't have duplicates of things around.
And I've forgotten the question again.
What was the question?
Interviewer:
How do you decide when you have too much?
Participant 16:
Clothes, when I no longer have places to hang them or store them folded in chests.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
Participant 16:
Books when I have run out of room.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 16:
A friend recently moved and she returned to me a, I think, one, two, three, four, five, six shelved teak bookcase, and so I immediately filled it up with books and on the bottom is a big Crockpot that I didn't have a place for.
Interviewer:
So it's when you realize things don't have their place anymore because that space has run out?
Participant 16:
Correct.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 16:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Participant 16:
Oh. Well, I think it would depend on how important the item was to me or how valuable I knew it was in money or that I could sell it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 16:
I don't...
How would I know when it's time to get rid of something?
Is that what you said?
Interviewer:
This one is if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Participant 16:
Oh. Interviewer:
So would it be monetary value or sentimentality value?
Participant 16:
I wold think the condition of it.
I'm looking at... I have one, two, three a big three shelves filled with cookbooks and gardening books.
Most of those are 10, 20, 30 years old.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
Participant 16:
A lot of them are out of date.
They're just like, Raw Food for Everyone.
I've never liked raw food except salads.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
