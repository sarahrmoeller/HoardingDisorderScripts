Interviewee:
There are plenty of things I could get rid of.
Now part of that is as an academic librarian, I know whether an old book has any value to someone else, so that's how I figure out what I want to take to Half Price Books.
I have a sense for what they would prefer.
So that's how I would...
Interviewer:
Okay, so you would take into consideration the condition of the objects and the worth of it to other people?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay, and what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
The biggest difference is emotional life of the person who's doing it.
Interviewer:
So their emotional condition?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And their instability, perhaps?
Interviewee:
I don't like to think of myself as being unstable, but...
Interviewer:
Like emotionally unstable?
Interviewee:
Yes, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Unsupported.
People who live alone, especially at old age, you really need people in your life.
And up until I quit working, I had countless people in my life all day every day.
Even on the weekends, I'd be out with friends or in stores and talking to neighbors.
Most of that has vanished.
I just haven't figured out how to replace it and the pandemic has really put a hold on moving forward with some things.
Interviewer:
I understand.
And what does hoarding disorder look like?
Interviewee:
Really messy.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
Interviewee:
Messy, overcrowded.
I don't want to say useless, but just about every object in my house could either go in the trash or most of it could be used by other people.
I'm looking at one of my grandmother's tea pitchers.
I'm sure it's valuable, some antique dealer would like to have it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Interviewee:
Well, I would think you have a pretty good idea and I've just been talking to you.
You haven't seen my home.
No, I don't think they have to see the home.
I think they could listen to the person talk about, they could interview the person as you're doing.
Yeah, they either have to see it or the person has to disclose it.
Interviewer:
Where do you get information about hoarding disorder if you do?
Interviewee:
Well, because I'm a retired former medical librarian and academic librarian, I know how to search online.
I know how to search Medline and the other medical databases.
I stay up on things online.
Interviewer:
Okay, so mostly online research?
Interviewee:
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
I think, boy, you have trouble.
Yeah, you need help.
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE
