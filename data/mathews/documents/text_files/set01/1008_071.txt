Interviewer:
Totally. Have you ever sought treatment for hoarding?
Participant 008:
No, I haven't.
Interviewer:
You haven't. Okay. Is that something that you'd be interested in doing or have thought about?
Participant 008:
Yeah. It's not something I've thought about a lot, but I probably have some interest. I would not be interested in any kind of medication but maybe therapy or something like that.
Interviewer:
Sure. Okay. So now, I'd like to ask you about where you live, the space. I know you said it's about three, clutter volume on a one to 10 scale, but can you tell me more about it? Do you live by yourself? Is it a big place? Is it a small place? Where are your items?
Participant 008:
Yes. It's a pretty large place. Most of what I have is either in closets or bookcases. There's one room that is maybe 70 or 80% full of stuff. Then the rest of the house, I would say, it would look kind of normal. It certainly wouldn't stand out as having clutter, but that one room has quite a bit of stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay, so it sounds like maybe your storage room or something like that, and the rest looks ...
Participant 008:
Yes.
Interviewer:
... Pretty normal?
Participant 008:
Exactly. Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. Got you. When you say ... Okay, so you have some closets. You have some stuff like that. Okay. Are there any parts of your home that you don't use at all because of the clutter? Or is everything pretty manageable, utilities, stuff like that?
Participant 008:
Yeah, outside of that one room, everything is manageable. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Got you. And is that a bedroom?
Participant 008:
It's kind of an office. It's the smallest roo in the house. It would be a bedroom, but it doesn't have a closet.
Interviewer:
Got you. Okay.
Participant 008:
It's meant to be an office.
Interviewer:
Sure. Are there some items that you value more than others? What kind of items do you keep? Are there some, yeah, just some that you keep more than others? Or is it kind of stuff all across the board?
Participant 008:
Books, and papers, and then gifts, stuff that was given to me.
Interviewer:
Gifts. Okay.
Participant 008:
Whatever it happens to be ...
Interviewer:
Got you. And when you say papers, are these, for example, your school papers and stuff like that? Or is it just kind of banking statements or random things?
Participant 008:
School papers, notes, work papers. 
Interviewer:
Got you. Okay. And books ...
Participant 008:
I have a filing cabinet for all the financial stuff. That's not out of control.
Interviewer:
Yeah, that's probably a good thing to keep, perhaps. 
Participant 008:
Yeah. It doesn't provoke anxiety to get rid of any of that.
Interviewer:
Good. Okay. So, when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?
Participant 008:
Connection to either my past or to other people.
Interviewer:
Okay. And then, what is trash for you? So, what are things you have no problem getting rid of?
Participant 008:
Financial papers, probably.
Interviewer:
Right.
