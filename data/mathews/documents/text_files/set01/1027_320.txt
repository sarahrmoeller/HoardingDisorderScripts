Participant 27:
First of all, you can walk through all the rooms in my house. Secondly, I don't... I'm just thinking of that TV show. I don't keep everything that comes into the house. I don't keep all the newspapers, all the magazines, all the food trays. My sink is always empty, but that's because of Jerry. He does the dishes. My things are very, very clean and that's what people comment on because I take people through my house when friends come over. If they haven't seen my house, I take them through my whole house. They say that I am the most clean, organized hoarder they've ever met. 
I think my things are clean. When my grandchildren come or when other people come, they have to wash their hands before they pick anything up. I don't want to have dirty stuff around. No dirty toys, nothing. It's also organized. The window sills have stuff lined up on them. The tables, like how some people decorate for Christmas and you go into their house and there's no empty space because they have Christmas stuff all around, that's my house all year round. 
Interviewer:
Gotcha. It sounds like some differences are that your place is clean and people can walk through all the rooms. You don't keep everything. That you're able to use places like your sink. Is that correct? 
Participant 27:
Yes, yes. And all the bathrooms are clean. There's not a lot of stuff. 
Interviewer:
I know we mentioned earlier some ways to identify hoarding disorder and you mentioned some things like some hoarders you think about them being overweight, being older. They might talk about an item, shop for a lot of different things. Are there any other ways that you might be able to identify someone with hoarding disorder without being in their home? 
Participant 27:
If not, that's okay too. 
Interviewer:
If you looked in their car, probably they would have a lot of stuff in their car. I don't know. I don't know if it's just that TV show that colors the way I think of hoarders. This is being pretty prejudice, but I just see the ones that are on TV. They don't seem to have a really high IQ except for the ones on... What's that road show where they go out to people's barns? 
Participant 27:
They go out to people's barns and they find people that have collected all this stuff in their dusty barns and they buy it from them. I don't know. Jerry's not here. He would know the name of the show. I don't know. I feel like that I'm well educated, and I'm in control. If I didn't feel that way, I would do something about it. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 27:
I just feel like... I don't know that I would recognize a hoarder. I just feel like hoarders are out of control. I don't know.
