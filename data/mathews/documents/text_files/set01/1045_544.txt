Participant 45:
I would like to be, I mean, I even would like some rooms to be almost minimalist, even like your ... think of a magazine, a shot of a modern home that's all very ... only a few pieces of furniture and possibly not even any carpet, a very modern home. I'd like to have a little bit of that. I'd also like to have some cozier rooms but I would like all rooms to be in the golden mean, in the middle, not ... some of those rooms it's okay if there are things out, a little bit out, I think that's fine but I would like it to be much more in the center of the way most people would be. 
Interviewer:
Okay, and when you say cozier-
Participant 45:
Or more normal. Something in a magazine where you could flip open and they'd have some things around, not totally staged and styled, but just a normal home. 
Interviewer:
Okay, and when you say cozier-
Participant 45:
And I know normal is an impossible word to use but ...
Interviewer:
Okay, so-
Participant 45:
Do you have a feel for what I'm saying?
Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah. I think I'm getting it now. So how important would you say your things are for you to feel at home? Which objects are the most important ones that you spend most of your time with?
Participant 45:
Probably books, most of my time with books and magazines. And then I have ... my worst problem is with mail that comes in. I, myself, don't bring in too much stuff but the mail comes and I just can't seem to get it processed and get rid of it and so box after box after box starts stacking up of more incoming mail. 
Interviewer:
Okay, do you often miss bill payments then if you don't get through the mail in time?
Participant 45:
No, not often. I try to get bills paid immediately when they come in so that I don't lose them and then I will file those away once they get paid. I have files of paid bills for way too many years. I mean, there's no reason to keep them for 10 years or 20 years and then financial statements, things like that, I know that you can get ... but you see, you can get it from online but I actually need data from before ... they're actually ... see this is a question of need. There are things in here that I need, it's just that it's so disorganized I can't get to what it is I do need, therefore I don't throw out more things because ... and then it makes it harder to get to what you really do need.
