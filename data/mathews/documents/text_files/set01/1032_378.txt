Participant 32:
Only a little bit because actually this house I bought is a lot bigger than what I've had before so I do have a lot more space. And I have some rooms that I don't even have anything in and I love that. So, I haven't decided what I'm going to use those rooms for. But the thing is I still do... Any of the furniture I have that has a horizontal surface I cover up with clutter including my dining room table. So, I pretty much never eat meals at the table and it would be nice to eat at the table but instead, I have my laptop there. And my ritual is every morning I make my pot of tea and then sit down at the table and check my emails on my laptop. And that's also where my disorganized mail from who knows when might be stacking up around there. And so, anyway. Yeah, so the table is not usable as what it was designed for. 
Interviewer:
So, you use it more as an office space rather than a place for dining?
Participant 32:
I do, yep. 
Interviewer:
Okay, and when you think about your possessions... I know that you've mentioned it makes you feel closer to family like you have family in your home. But what else makes them valuable? How do you determine if an object is valuable or not? 
Participant 32:
Well, I guess one is if it makes me feel good. If it makes me smile, makes me happy, makes me feel good then it's for sure valuable. But then there are things I know that don't make me feel good or feel happy that I can't seem to cut loose of. And I guess that's the sentimentality or attachment that is hard for me to deal with. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so it's that sentimentality that we keep going back to that's your main priority? 
Participant 32:
For some of it. But I'm sorry, I'm going to go back now to the overall picture. So much of what is cluttering my house is not sentimental, it's utilitarian and it's just... I just need to decide that I'm going to give it away if it's still something useful. I mean.... This is kind of an aside now, I don't think I have trouble discarding stuff that's truly junk and not useful and stuff to go to the landfill. That is not so hard for me to do. But if it's something like... Okay, I have way, way, way, way, way more pens and pencils that anybody needs to have. I don't buy them anymore, I haven't for years but I guess I used to buy them and I will collect them. A lot of places give them to you for free and it's like, "Oh, yeah." I'm one of those people, it's hard to say no to anything that's offered freely.
