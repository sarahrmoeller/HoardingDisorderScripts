Interviewee:
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Definitely, definitely.
For instance, I'm an all around the year shopper for Christmas and stuff because, as I explained, we lived overseas so our shopping was always limited as to what you could buy and stuff.
We'd come to America and buy stuff for Halloween and Christmas in June every year.
I shop a lot and I would buy these things and I'll put them away and then I can't find them when it's time for Christmas to give to people
I get really upset because where could it possibly be?
I found everything I think I was looking for recently, when I was doing my little purge down there the last couple of months, but it was really upsetting at the time that, "Well now, I'm going to have to go out and buy more, even I've already bought all of this ahead of time and I have it wrapped and it's all ready to go, but where'd I put it?
I have no idea."
It was upsetting, yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
When you lived abroad, do you think you valued stuff differently because you weren't able to get it necessarily?
Interviewee:
Well kind of, yeah, because we're Americans and we lived in Asia for years and years, probably 15 years, and we lived in Europe for about 10 years.
We valued stuff that we could get that was American, especially in Asia, because you're automatically a foreigner there.
You don't look like anybody else, so you always stand out, you're always different.
To buy the stuff that I needed to have for my children to have this American style life overseas, I really valued it a lot.
Now I look back and I go, "Why didn't I buy some really good stuff in Europe?" It's those things I didn't buy.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
That's really interesting.
How did it impact your relationships?
You mentioned briefly that it upset your sisters, but did it affect your marriage at all?
Interviewee:
No, no, because my husband's kind of the same way I am.
Interviewer:
Oh, okay.
You just kind of fed off of each other?
Interviewee:
Yeah, uh-huh .
Yeah.
We're buyers and always have been, but he's not the bargain shopper like I am.
Interviewer:
Oh, Was it difficult at all to get him to help you clean out?
Interviewee:
Well, he took a long time and that's why the quarantine time, it was the first time.
We both are retired.
We don't work and we both are healthy and we can't go anywhere, so this is the time we're going to do it.
I never wanted to do it by myself because I never thought I would be able to accomplish it because it was so overwhelming.
Interviewer:
Did you guys get anyone to help you or anything?
Interviewee:
No, no. We just did it ourselves, yeah.
