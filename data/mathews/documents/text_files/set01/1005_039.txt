Interviewer:
Have you found yourself buying more things during COVID?
Participant 005:
No. A couple of things, like with new hobbies. If I was doing a lot of baking, I might buy a couple of baking tools. But, in general, no.
Interviewer:
Okay. Would you say COVID has made you more ... I'm not sure how to phrase it. Like more urgent to throw away things CROSSTALK.
Participant 005:
More aware.
Interviewer:
More aware? Okay.
Participant 005:
Yeah. More aware of the issues and I'm starting to go through my closet and getting rid of things if I haven't worn them in a long time or they don't look great on.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Has COVID affected your sense of attachment to your items and the value to your items in any way?
Participant 005:
I think it is starting to cause me to eliminate that from my brain, try not to think about how much did you pay for that? Yeah. I think that I have taken much more to the Goodwill ... I should say, I have taken more valuable things to a charity organization than I have in the past.
Interviewer:
Yeah. That makes sense. Has COVID impacted your overall physical or mental health in any way or just your physical wellbeing, your mental wellbeing?
Participant 005:
It has impacted it in a very positive way. I started doing yoga and I have been exercising and walking and I've lost 35 pounds since COVID started. It's been a very positive change for me.
Interviewer:
Has COVID affected you or your family financially? Either negatively or positively.
Participant 005:
No. Luckily, it has not.
Interviewer:
Okay. How have you been coping since COVID? I hear you say that you may have got new hobbies or anything but, overall, again how have you been coping since COVID?
Participant 005:
Are you asking what do I do to cope with it? Am I coping with it successfully?
Interviewer:
I guess both. What have you been doing and then has that been successful for you?
Participant 005:
Okay. I've been doing yoga daily and trying to meditate. I, from the get go, established a bubble with two other people, another couple in our neighborhood, some friends of mine. My daughter and I and the two of them we kept our households as one and we cooked together a lot and it wasn't just me alone, thank goodness, or it wasn't just me and my daughter. We had this outlet of two other people. We kept a social network going that way, which I think helped tremendously to get through some of those worst times.
As it drags on and on, it's beginning to wear on me. I used to hike all the time. Of course, now, I live in southern California so our mountains are on fire. I can't hike right now. You know, I do what I can to be outside, and not cooped up, a couple times a day.
