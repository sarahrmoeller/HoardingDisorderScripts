24:42 Interviewer:
Right, so I know that you mentioned that your husband and yourself, that you collect coins. So would you say that this is an example of a normal saving behavior? 
Participant:
Yes. 24:54 Interviewer:
Okay, so it’s just more orderly, you know what you have. 
2Participant:
And they’re stored together, organized. 
25:02 Interviewer:
Okay, so organization is definitely a big thing. 
2Participant:
Yeah, you’re not going to trip over them! 
25:10 Interviewer:
Right, so I know I asked you how you can tell if someone has hoarding disorder in the beginning. So you mentioned that it’s messy and they have trouble getting rid of things, so how is that the same or different from your behavior? 
Participant:
I think it’s the same. I mean, I have trouble getting rid of things for whatever reason, and it’s a big mess, and it’s very apparent, and it’s in the way of, you know, life here, and it’s pissing people off. 
25:58 Interviewer:
Right, so do you think there’s a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder or issues with clutter without being in their home? 
Participant:
That’s a good question. 26:11 Interviewer:
Thank you! 
Participant:
Perhaps, I mean I carry like a little fanny pack as my purse, and it’s usually stuffed. Although, I don’t have a problem emptying out the garbage and that sort of stuff periodically from it. So I don’t know if you could infer that if somebody has… you know… a purse stuffed with stuff… I don’t know! 
26:41 Interviewer:
I don’t know either, but I know it’s a female’s prerogative to carry a purse, so. 
Participant:
You would think that a person who has hoarding disorder, their car would be disorganized. It’s full of trash and all this stuff. 
26:56 Interviewer:
Okay, so their car could be a way to tip someone off that someone may have hoarding disorder. 
Participant:
It could be, but if you look at my car, it’s fine. I don’t keep crap in it that shouldn't be there, and I don’t pile trash in there either, so. 
27:13 Interviewer:
So compared to your house, your car is less cluttered then? 
Participant:
For sure, yes. 27:20 Interviewer:
Okay, so where do you get your information about hoarding disorder? 
Participant:
Maybe online or I like to watch a lot of medical or such type programs on TV. 
27:39 Interviewer:
Can you give me a couple of examples of these shows that you watch? 
Participant:
Well I don’t watch, maybe because it’s painful! There’s this show I think called “Hoarding” or “The Hoarders” or something like that. 
27:52 Interviewer:
Right, I think I’ve heard of that one. 
Participant:
Yeah, and I’ve watched one or two of those, and, you know, you would think I’m a hoarder from watching that. Although, we can mostly [28:07] INCOHERENT in this one room! 
28:10 Interviewer:
So would you say compared to the extreme cases on those shows, would you have less clutter than them? 
Participant:
Yes.
