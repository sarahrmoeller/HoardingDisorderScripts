Participant 33:
We like our small house.
We like that it doesn't take long to vacuum or that we don't have a big heating bill or things like that, but it's just a question of how do we get organized, how do we have something that we could be proud to have somebody sit in our living room instead of what we currently have.
How do we get there?
Of course, it's all the time.
I work 40 hours a week.
I have elderly parents in Maryland who I'm constantly going down to visit.
Part of the reason why I get involved in these studies is because my mom has Alzheimer's and my grandmother had Alzheimer's.
I feel like I'm next in line for it.
It's the Alzheimer's groups that I'm a part of that connect me through to these studies.
It's a question...
Time is also in very short supply, so even though it seems like it should be reasonable to get ourselves into a better place, into a more beautiful household environment, it never happens in reality.
Interviewer:
Right, there's always so many things competing for our time.
Participant 33:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Thinking about areas that are cluttered, are there specific parts of your home that you would consider cluttered?
Participant 33:
Almost every room I would say with perhaps exception of the bathroom.
Our kitchen, we try to do a good job in.
The kitchen is okay except of course that there's always a stack of papers by my seat of things that I have kept to review over breakfast or whatever, which I should do something about that.
Yeah, I guess there's a few areas that are the least cluttered areas.
Interviewer:
Okay, the bathroom and the kitchen?
Participant 33:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Are there parts of your home that you don't use?
It sounds like there's not-
Participant 33:
The basement.
Interviewer:
The basement?
Participant 33:
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch that last part.
Interviewer:
I'm sorry.
Are there parts of your home that you don't use or that you don't use the way they're intended?
Participant 33:
Most of the clutter is in the basement.
As my kids grow up, we're hoping to make that into a more usable place.
Right now, our basement pretty much solely is for storage, but we're hoping to clear that out and make it to a bigger play space for them.
Interviewer:
Okay, so making a nice place for them to play.
Participant 33:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Going back to the different things that you have, as far as you have these inherited, gifted things, things that you might use, but may be considered valueless to others and then these books that you were talking about, how important are those things for you to feel at home?
Participant 33:
How important are they to do what at home?
Interviewer:
Just to make you feel at home.
