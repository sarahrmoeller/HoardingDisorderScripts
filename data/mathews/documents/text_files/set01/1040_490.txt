Interviewee:
I'd like my plants on the wall back there to grow.
I have two African Violets, and I keep them alive mostly.
And they're plants that don't need much water.
And that, I starve them to death for water because I can't see them.
They're out of mind.
Interviewer:
They're out of mind because, okay, because you can't see them.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Got you, that makes sense.
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE] being able to sometimes pull it together.
And there for a while, I was taking five quilting magazines.
I just enjoy looking at them.
I enjoy the mathematics of it.
Does this fit, why does this fit together, or how would it go together, how would I do it differently if I were assembling this?
But I don't do it... I do it mentally in my head, and I don't need to do it on fabric.
I just collect the fabric.
Interviewer:
So we've talked about this kind of already, but when you think about your possessions, what makes your possessions valuable?
Interviewee:
What makes them valuable?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm , or how do you-
Interviewee:
In and of themselves, there is nothing that I own that is valuable, that I could take down to a pawn shop and get money for it.
Interviewer:
So not monetarily valuable.
Interviewee:
Nothing monetarily valuable.
But they're resources that I can use to check a hymn to see what hymn it is, or check a piece of scripture, or figure out how to do a particular technique, or how to do this stitch in embroidery.
And those are my resources.
I got a lot of them.
Everyone is a little bit different, and I do an, what's the word, aggregate.
I do something from all of it that I think makes it even better than any one.
I do have an ego, and sometimes I outsmart myself by doing that because it doesn't work.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
But as far as what makes it valuable to me is the fact that I can use it to answer a question.
Interviewer:
Okay, so it's valuable if you can use it to answer a question.
Interviewee:
Yeah, I can do it now.
I don't have to wait until I either ask the librarian at the library or find someone who knows.
I can pick it up in a book.
Interviewer:
How important are your things for you to feel at home?
Interviewee:
Well, how valuable, important?
Interviewer:
Sorry, yeah, I kind of switched the question on you.
So, yeah, so you talked about the things that are valuable are things that you use to answer questions and they're resources.
How important are these things for you to feel at home?
How much do you feel like you need them in order to feel at home?
Interviewee:
Yeah, a great deal.
Interviewer:
A great deal, okay.
