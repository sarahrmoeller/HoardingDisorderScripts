Interviewer:
So, while you would like to change the fact that you have all of this stuff, you want to change it in the right way.
You want to go through it and make decisions about what you're going to keep and what you're not going to keep?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
If you had to just get rid of some of your stuff, that would be really upsetting to you?
Interviewee:
If I don't need it, it wouldn't be.
Interviewer:
If you don't need it-
Interviewee:
Because I don't need it
Interviewer:
Yeah.
If you know that it's something that you don't need, you can get rid of it.
That doesn't bother you, but the idea of getting rid of stuff without knowing that it's not important, that really bothers you.
Is that right?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I guess.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I guess.
Is that wrong?
Interviewer:
No, no.
Interviewee:
Are you saying I should be?
Interviewer:
No, no, no. I'm trying to understand how you feel.
There is no right or wrong answers here, for sure.
No, it makes total sense to me what you're saying.
Again, I'm just going to try to say it back to you.
So, it sounds like the amount of stuff bothers you.
The amount of stuff in a small space bothers you, and having to pay all this money to store it bothers you, but you definitely don't want to just get rid of stuff willy-nilly without having the opportunity to decide what it is you're saving and why, and so the main-
Interviewee:
Yeah, because when I tried that once, then I later had regrets.
Interviewer:
You really regretted it when you didn't have a chance to go through it, so are kind of slow-
Interviewee:
Right, and then I was asked about things, "Where's this?
Where's that?"
Interviewer:
And you were like, "Well, I don't have it anymore," and that was very upsetting?
Interviewee:
Yeah, and it was also other people's things that they could've used.
Interviewer:
That makes total sense.
I kind of want to close out by asking you how you have been affected by this whole recent situation with the COVID pandemic.
Has that affected your life at all?
Interviewee:
Some things I wanted, like books I wanted to hand off, the establishment had been closed, so I haven't been able to [CROSSTALK] hand things off to [CROSSTALK]
Interviewer:
So, a public library or wherever you're taking your books, you haven't been able to go and do the drop-off.
That makes sense.
I know those places have been closed.
Have you found yourself acquiring more stuff because you're worried that there will be scarcity?
Interviewee:
Only some food items, but I do try to eat things before they expire, that sort of thing.
