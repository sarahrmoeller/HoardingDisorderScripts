Participant 022:
Oh yeah.
The stairs, the counters, the furniture in the bedroom.
Downstairs in my basement, it was totally and completely filled with boxes, empty boxes, and boxes half full of this and half full of that, tons of craft projects, or home projects that were not finished that were just stacked all over.
You literally could not walk through the room.
Interviewer:
Did you have any parts of your home that you didn't use for the intended purpose?
Could you access the refrigerator or the stove in your kitchen?
Participant 022:
Oh yeah, yeah.
I could do that.
Yeah, yeah.
One bathroom was totally filled with stuff, so you couldn't use that.
The open space in the basement, you couldn't walk through because there were so many piles.
There were little paths through it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 022:
Sounds fun, doesn't it?
Interviewer:
That's most people's answers.
Now you said that you cleaned it out, you said you can walk through every room, right?
Participant 022:
I put up a ping-pong table so you can play ping-pong, yeah.
Interviewer:
Oh wow.
Participant 022:
I know, yeah.
I've had the ping-pong table up for 10 years, but never could put it up because there was no room.
Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 022:
My husband worked for the Department of Defense, so we moved a lot, every, maybe three or four years overseas.
Every move we would just accumulate more and more and more.
Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 022:
Yeah, yeah.
I wouldn't throw things away of my children when they outgrew them.
I wasn't going to have any more kids so I don't know why I would keep them, but I would just keep stuff, probably because I was one of seven kids and never really had anything of my own.
I think I mentioned that I have four sisters.
As soon as you'd stop playing with a doll, someone else would pick it up and take it.
That's, I'm sure, part of the reason why I did that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 022:
Okay.
Interviewer:
What are your most important things for you to feel at home?
Participant 022:
For me to feel at home?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Which objects?
Participant 022:
A book, a stereo.
We have five stereos in our house.
It's a lot, I think.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
I don't know.
Participant 022:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
I don't know.
Participant 022:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Do you spend the most time with your stereos and your books?
Participant 022:
Yeah, probably.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?
How do you determine whether an object is valuable or not?
