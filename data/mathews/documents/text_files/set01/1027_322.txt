Interviewer:
Has hoarding ever gotten...
Or impacted any of your relationships outside of your family?
I know we talked about your children and their spouses, but any romantic relationships or friendships?
Interviewee:
Definitely not, no.
Interviewer:
Never interfered with anything like work?
Interviewee:
No, definitely not.
Interviewer:
It sounds like based off what you told me, this is something that you feel like you have in control.
It's not something you really want to change.
Is that correct?
Interviewee:
Yeah, the only thing that I would like to do is to find buyers for the stuff in my eBay, Craigslist room.
I'd like to find people who collect.
I have an Erector Set from 1950.
CROSSTALK very, very cool.
It's the larger Erector Set with all the pieces there because in everything that I have, I count all the pieces.
I make sure all the instructions... I always save all the boxes, even the packaging for everything.
To find a toy that has all of the original stuff in it is pretty cool.
I don't want to sell that Erector Set.
I want somebody to play with it, but I want somebody also who knows that keeping that box with it is saving a piece of history as well.
I would like to find more... I used to have...
There was an eBay selling company here that would sell your stuff on eBay.
They took a pretty hefty...
They took 40%, but at least I knew it was going to somebody really, really wanted it.
I sold a...
It was a Hot Wheels garage in the box with the original car for $125, and I had paid $10 for it.
Interviewer:
oh wow.
Interviewee:
Now, he did take 40% for his profit, but very happy that somebody got it that knows... that would have liked something like...
They wouldn't have paid that amount of money if they were going to just give it to a kid to break.
Interviewer:
I think that's almost all the questions I have for you.
I have a few demographic questions that I would like to ask you, but is there anything that you think I should know that I haven't asked you about?
Interviewee:
No, aren't you interested in coming to my house and seeing all that I have?
Interviewer:
I mean it definitely sounds like you have some interesting things.
The antiques especially sound interesting, but it's a little bit of a distance so.
Interviewee:
You're in Florida.
Interviewer:
Yes, yeah.
I'm in Florida.
Interviewee:
Where are you in Florida?
Interviewer:
I'm here in Gainsville at the university.
Interviewee:
Okay, we're in Palmetto.
Interviewer:
Okay, gotcha.
Interviewee:
CROSSTALK been emailing somebody at the University of Florida.
Our dog ate a death cap mushroom and died in December.
Interviewer:
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I sent the dried mushroom so INAUDIBLE.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
