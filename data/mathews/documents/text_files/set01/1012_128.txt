Interviewee:
Okay. Would you say your behavior is severe? Do you believe it's a problem or not?
Participant 012:
Going in and out of that through my life ... Now that I'm hitting retirement I'm realizing I've got to clean out and let go of stuff. I'm starting to work through that. It's an effort but I need to so I'm working on changing that behavior now. There are other times it's been out of control and it's difficult to deal with but right now I'm at the place of dealing with it.
Interviewee:
Okay. It's gone through periods of being severe and then you've worked on it a bit?
Participant 012:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Okay. Have you ever gone or sought professional treatment?
Participant 012:
Not for it. No.
Interviewee:
No? Okay. When you did go through periods of change was it kind of instigated yourself? Like you felt you needed to do something or did maybe your husband say something?
Participant 012:
At different times ... Right now, it's myself. In the past, there have been times that my husband said something or someone else has said something. Yeah. It's been so many years. When I was a kid my mom would say something. Yeah. Then I would deal with it but, currently, it's myself.
Interviewee:
Okay. You mentioned that your family has said something before. How do they feel about your behavior? Has it ever caused conflicts between you guys?
Participant 012:
Not a terrible conflict. Of course, I wouldn't like hearing it or I don't want to deal with it but I do. Initially, resistance but never real super conflict.
Interviewee:
Okay. It's kind of been like you might have been irritated or angry but it was resolved?
Participant 012:
Yeah. Yeah.
Interviewee:
Okay. This next section is going to be talking about your space and your living area. Can you please describe where you live now and what the space looks like?
Participant 012:
Where I live now? 
Interviewee:
Yeah. Not like geographically. Like what kind of house or apartment.
Participant 012:
Oh, okay. We live in a single story house. A number of rooms and all of the rooms have lots of stuff in them. I mean, we can certainly move around and things. It's not preventing us from using our rooms. Sometimes I have to move things around in order to do that but each room has lots of stuff in it.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Participant 012:
Not .... You know, like bookshelves and up and around. I do have boxes on some floors. That's true. It's not like you hear about where people walk in and the place is so full it falls over. It's not like that at all. It's very mild.
Interviewee:
Okay. You would consider your home cluttered?
Participant 012:
Yeah. Yeah. I don't have people over because it's cluttered. It's not straight.
