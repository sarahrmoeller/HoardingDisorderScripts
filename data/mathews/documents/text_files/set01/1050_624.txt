Interviewer:
So they're speaking ignorantly.
Yeah.
This might seem like a weird question, but actually the word hoarding gets used a lot in reference to this whole COVID thing.
I know that they're not talking about hoarding disorder, but they're talking about hoarding in the sense of taking too much stuff.
Does that ever figure into how you think about your own behavior?
I mean, how do you react when you hear people being called hoarders in the context of COVID?
Do you feel like that's at all related?
Participant 50:
No, because of the fact that this is more of like fight or flight type of hoarding in the sense that people feel like if they have to go out and get stuff, it's like every time I go out, it's a Russian type thing.
And so it's more of a survival thing as opposed to an issue where a stockpile or what have you.
Because I mean, I think it's based on fear out of trying to feel safe because I think the hoarding issue has something because usually the person has had some type of traumatic issue happened in their life that they're trying to cover up or something.
Versus somebody that wants to make sure that they have what they need so that they could stand high for this length of time because people outside are dying.
Because today I just had to turn off the TV.
It was just too much.
People are scared because just think like 700 and something people died yesterday in New York. 700 people.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah, people are panicking.
Participant 50:
If I had the choice of hoarding a little toilet paper so I didn't have to go outside and possibly catch this thing, heck yeah.
So I don't think it's the same thing.
Interviewer:
Has it changed your behavior at all?
Do you feel like you've bought more stuff because of the fear that you'll get stuck inside?
Do you feel like you've engaged in any of that?
Has it made CROSSTALK?
