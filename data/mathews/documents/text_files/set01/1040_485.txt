Participant 040:
Yeah. Talk about redoing equipment and having equipment handy, I went out and purchased five seam rippers. For some unknown reason, they disappear and then they reappear. But I needed it. I didn't open them all right away, but eventually I did. I think I still have one that I haven't opened.
Interviewer:
Okay. So it sounds like one of the problems is that things kind of disappear now and again.
Participant 040:
Yeah. It's very frustrating. I will use something and I'll stand right there, I'll set down that implement that I'd be using, and then I do something else right there. And then I go to use that again and it's rolled away or it's lost or it's under something. It's like it disappears by magic. And then I look around for it, sure enough, it's close by. I don't know whether we, yes we did, my way of remedying. We haven't gotten to that one yet.
Interviewer:
Way of remedying. You can go ahead and touch on it right now.
Participant 040:
There's a gentlemen who did carpentry. And when he laid down a tool, it was right there. Everything was in a row, decently in an order. And he knew exactly where it is, was. He could pick it up and use it and then set it down right there. And I have been trying to do that without much success, but that's a goal that I have. And someday it will come to fruition.
Interviewer:
Laying tools down in a systematic way, it sounds like.
Participant 040:
Yeah, very systematic.
Interviewer:
Have you ever sought treatment for a hoarding disorder or clutter problems?
Participant 040:
I did, actually. I looked around for a psychiatrist or a psychologist or people that treat. I checked on the web. And there are people who treat various mental things, but nobody here in Charlottesville seemed to treat hoarding or list hoarding as a thing that needed to be addressed. There was one person, but he holds two offices, or the firm has two offices, 30 miles away. And he stays in the office 30 miles away. My neurologist seems to think I should not be driving, and this is as of three or four years ago. And I understand it, but I don't have the freedom to pick up and go, which irritates the [inaudible 00:15:46] out of me.
Interviewer:
I can imagine. It sounds like you were interested in getting help from either a psychiatrist or a psychologist but that they were too far away. And you said that your neurologist doesn't recommend you driving.
