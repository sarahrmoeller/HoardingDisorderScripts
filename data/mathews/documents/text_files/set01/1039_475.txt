Interviewer:
Right. Okay. Gotcha. So now I'm going to read another one. John Doe has boxes, books and bags that he keeps in case he needs to use them in the future. These boxes, bags and books occupy most of his room except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens he is usually late to getting to where he needs to be. Do you think this person has hoarding?
Participant 039:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And so far, how does-
Participant 039:
It's so bad that either he has a very small house and can't come up with something creative. I have often thought that if push came to shove and I ran out of room to store things in that I thought I wanted, I would figure out some way to make a net. I would either buy a net of some kind or make a net and hang it from the ceiling.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Participant 039:
He's either not very creative about where to store his boxes so that he has to store them in his bathroom, but in any case I would think that it's hoarding.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. How would you say that this so far compares to your hoarding? Do you think it's kind of similar?
Participant 039:
No. I haven't stooped so low so to speak to store things where I can't take a shower. 
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 039:
If I lived by myself maybe that would be something different, but I have a partner to think of and she's got it, she takes a shower more often than I do and I certainly couldn't put things in the shower.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. It sounds like you aren't as severe as putting things in maybe places that really don't make sense because you can still use your areas, but it sounds like you experience the same thing with the stacks of boxes as what is being described here?
Participant 039:
Right.
