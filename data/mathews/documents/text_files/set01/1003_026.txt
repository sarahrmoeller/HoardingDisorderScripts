Interviewer:
Nice. And what would you like your home to look like ideally?
Participant  004:
Again are we talking in general terms?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant  004:
Oh, a single family home, more space, [inaudible 00:08:34] more space to clean, [inaudible 00:08:38] more space.
Interviewer:
Okay. Which objects are most important to you, and which ones do you spend a lot of time with?
Participant  004:
I guess [inaudible 00:08:51] we keep the TV in the room too, [inaudible 00:08:55]. I guess my books, [inaudible 00:09:00].
Interviewer:
Okay. And how important are your things for you to feel at home?
Participant  004:
I have a sentimental attachment to many things. Sentimental stuff, [inaudible 00:09:28], other than that, there's not too much I'm attached to.
Interviewer:
Okay. Are there any parts of your home that you don't use, or any parts of your home that you don't use in the way they're intended?
Participant  004:
No. There's no full rooms that are like dangerous [inaudible 00:09:54].
Interviewer:
Okay. Great. When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?
Participant  004:
[inaudible 00:10:09] I guess it's just [inaudible 00:10:17] books that are entertaining, [inaudible 00:10:27] I guess it's a sentimental attachment to [inaudible 00:10:33].
Interviewer:
Yeah. So what would you consider trash and when would you throw it away?
Participant  004:
A lot of this stuff is trash. [inaudible 00:10:40] sometimes we get [inaudible 00:10:53], just stuff that is not [inaudible 00:11:10].
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you think you have too much stuff in your house, and how would you know?
Participant  004:
Yeah. Yeah, I do, and I think that [inaudible 00:11:24]. So we really [inaudible 00:11:32] register stuff [inaudible 00:11:34].
Interviewer:
Okay. I know you mentioned your TV. Is there anything that's the most precious item for you in your house?
Participant  004:
Oh, I guess it'd probably be something from my dad. [inaudible 00:12:01] or something like that.
Interviewer:
I'm assuming it's valuable to you because of the sentimental value it has?
Participant  004:
Right.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. If you had to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?
Participant  004:
Generally speaking it's utility I guess. How much use I can get out of it. How long it's going to last. How much space I can save [inaudible 00:12:38] versus [inaudible 00:12:41].
Interviewer:
Okay. And does your clutter problems upset you?
Participant  004:
I wouldn't say it upsets me [inaudible 00:12:51] sometimes.

Okay. Do you think it gets in any way of your daily life?

Does it upset any of your loved ones?
Participant  004:
Yeah. I think it kind of bothers my girlfriend.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Do you think it's ever impacted your relationship with your girlfriend?
Participant  004:
No, I can't really think of how, it's just one of those things where we say that we need to [inaudible 00:13:31] something to discuss.
Interviewer:
Okay. Would you like to change your clutter problems?
Participant  004:
Yeah.
