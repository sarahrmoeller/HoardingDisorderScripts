Interviewer:
Nice. And what would you like your home to look like ideally?
Interviewee:
Again are we talking in general terms?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Interviewee:
Oh, a single family home, more space, [INAUDIBLE] more space to clean, [INAUDIBLE] more space.
Interviewer:
Okay. Which objects are most important to you, and which ones do you spend a lot of time with?
Interviewee:
I guess [INAUDIBLE] we keep the TV in the room too, [INAUDIBLE]. I guess my books, [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay. And how important are your things for you to feel at home?
Interviewee:
I have a sentimental attachment to many things. Sentimental stuff, [INAUDIBLE], other than that, there's not too much I'm attached to.
Interviewer:
Okay. Are there any parts of your home that you don't use, or any parts of your home that you don't use in the way they're intended?
Interviewee:
No. There's no full rooms that are like dangerous [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay. Great. When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE] I guess it's just [INAUDIBLE] books that are entertaining, [INAUDIBLE] I guess it's a sentimental attachment to [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Yeah. So what would you consider trash and when would you throw it away?
Interviewee:
A lot of this stuff is trash. [INAUDIBLE] sometimes we get [INAUDIBLE], just stuff that is not [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you think you have too much stuff in your house, and how would you know?
Interviewee:
Yeah. Yeah, I do, and I think that [INAUDIBLE]. So we really [INAUDIBLE] register stuff [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay. I know you mentioned your TV. Is there anything that's the most precious item for you in your house?
Interviewee:
Oh, I guess it'd probably be something from my dad. [INAUDIBLE] or something like that.
Interviewer:
I'm assuming it's valuable to you because of the sentimental value it has?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. If you had to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?
Interviewee:
Generally speaking it's utility I guess. How much use I can get out of it. How long it's going to last. How much space I can save [INAUDIBLE] versus [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay. And does your clutter problems upset you?
Interviewee:
I wouldn't say it upsets me [INAUDIBLE] sometimes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you think it gets in any way of your daily life?
Interviewee:
Not a lot. No, it doesn't. We [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Does it upset any of your loved ones?
Interviewee:
Yeah. I think it kind of bothers my girlfriend.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Do you think it's ever impacted your relationship with your girlfriend?
Interviewee:
No, I can't really think of how, it's just one of those things where we say that we need to [INAUDIBLE] something to discuss.
Interviewer:
Okay. Would you like to change your clutter problems?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
