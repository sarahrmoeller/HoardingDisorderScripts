Interviewer:
Okay. And how important are your things for you to feel at home?
Participant  004:
I have a sentimental attachment to many things. Sentimental stuff, [INAUDIBLE], other than that, there's not too much I'm attached to.
Interviewer:
Okay. Are there any parts of your home that you don't use, or any parts of your home that you don't use in the way they're intended?

Oh, I guess it'd probably be something from my dad. [INAUDIBLE] or something like that.
Interviewer:
I'm assuming it's valuable to you because of the sentimental value it has?
Participant  004:
Right.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. If you had to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?
Participant  004:
