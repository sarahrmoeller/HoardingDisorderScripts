Interviewer:
All right, perfect, thank you. Okay, so this is the last story that I'm going to read you. Okay, so John Doe has several antiques that he likes to keep, because he likes them and he knows that they are valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried that he might get rid of an antique that's worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room, before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he's looking for. He's almost always late getting where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. In this case, do you think this person has clutter problems or is their behavior more like hoarding disorder?
Participant 2:
It's still going to be more of hoarding if he has to move things. Well, when I hear things like, "He can't the find keys," I think of a clutter thing, and if you have to move things around a little bit. If it's to the point where you have a whole lot and you can't... If it's moving or spilling over into the bathroom, I start to think hoarding, because that's functional, unless you've got a whole bunch of shelves in your bathroom or something. Similar where my kitchen was, I never had things spilled into the bathroom, but I certainly did it with my kitchen. My kitchen table's full of non-kitchen items. Just random stuff from the house, stuff I was collecting, or just stuff that I didn't want to put anywhere else, because I didn't know where to put it or just procrastinating of getting organized, or whatever. I didn't have much counter space, so every time I cooked I had to move everything, so I guess I'd call it hoarding.
Interviewer:
Do you think this person should try to change their behavior then?
Participant 2:
Yeah, just so they can be functional and on time for things.
Interviewer:
Did you really think that treatment would come from a psychiatrist?
Participant 2:
It could be beneficial. I think with things like that, you could get help from either a psychiatrist, or you could first start with a life coach, or just somebody that's going to take on a similar role, like when you're trying to start a diet or exercise program.
Interviewer:
Yeah, like a support, for sure.
Participant 2:
A support person, but if its something you're really struggling with then you probably need to see a doctor or a psychiatrist. See if its something you might need more help with.
Interviewer:
Yeah, for sure, and do you think this behavior is similar or different from that of your own?
