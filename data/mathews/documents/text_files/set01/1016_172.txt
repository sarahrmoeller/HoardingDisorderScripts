Interviewer:
I know you said you were retired, but do you still have a household income?
You can give me a broad range.
Participant 16:
I have two sources of income.
I have very minimal social security and I did not have a pension or a retirement fund.
I have money invested that the college and I contributed to, and annually I withdraw an amount from that money pot.
Interviewer:
So all together, could you just give me a broad range of your household income?
Participant 16:
What I'm expecting to withdraw this year is around 40,000.
It depends on whether I need to replace my 12-year-old car or the AC goes out or something like that.
It might be a bit more.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And your geographic region?
Participant 16:
I'm in central Texas.

Master's degree.
