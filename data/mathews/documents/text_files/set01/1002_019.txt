Interviewer:
Okay, so the next story is somewhat similar. I'm going to read it, okay? John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container that the item came in, he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stack of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered. It is difficult for him to walk in his house. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's always late in getting where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. Does the person depicted in this story have hoarding disorder or is it more like clutter problems, in your opinion?
Participant 2:
It's a hoarding problem.
Interviewer:
Okay, and do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Participant 2:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Can you tell me why in your opinion?
Participant 2:
Because its affecting social life, getting to places on time, and also him getting distracted, or like you mentioned he forgot what he was doing.
Interviewer:
Is this behavior similar or different to that of your own, in your opinion?
Participant 2:
Probably different.
Interviewer:
Can you tell me why in your opinion.
Participant 2:
Because I don't have to move things out of the way to get to my- well that's not... just because of the way my... Where I currently live, because I live with my parents, my mom is a neat freak and OCD in that way, so my situation's more of a clutter problem. But when I lived by myself, it was half and half clutter hoarding, so I would have to move things. Not to exactly the extent you described but when I was in the kitchen, I'd always have to move things. I did have a small kitchen though, but I didn't have a dishwasher, and I had small... Everything was just this small situation, but my kitchen looked like it was all... Everything stacked up and a mess. My bathroom was fine but my bedroom and our living were in that situation.
