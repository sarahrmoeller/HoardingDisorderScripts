Interviewer:
Sure. No, that makes sense.
Has it impacted anyone else, or is it just kind of your wife that you interact with?
Do you have any kids that it might affect?
Interviewee:
We have a kid now.
At this point, no, I don't think it really affects him, other than maybe the time I spend cataloging the books.
Maybe I could be doing other stuff, but I would say the effect is pretty minor.
I'm pretty motivated to not pass things on to him.
Interviewer:
Sure.
That makes sense.
Can you tell me more about your relationship with your dad and his hoarding?
Do you think that your hoarding stemmed from him, you know, you kind of growing up in that environment and seeing him have a lot of items, and you naturally saved items too?
Or yeah, just tell me a little more about that, if you don't mind.
Interviewee:
Yeah, absolutely.
Do I think ...
I'd like to think that part of it is genetic because just about everyone on that side of the family has large collections of something, and certainly ...
Yeah, I told you a bit about his upbringing.
That had a, I'm sure, a major impact on it as well.
There's very little information that I have now on anything related to his childhood.
I mean, I might have one picture from him before he lived on his own.
Interviewer:
So, when you say his upbringing contributed to it, you're saying you really don't know about his upbringing, but you think it did?
Or ...
Interviewee:
I know from his stories.
He had told me that by the time he was seven he had figured out, one time, they must have moved 14 times.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Interviewee:
And they grew up extremely poor.
His dad died when he was two years old.
So, this was during the Great Depression.
So, they just kind of shuttled around between relatives and whatever they could do to survive.
And he dropped out of school, I think, by the time he was in sixth grade to start working.
Interviewer:
Oh wow.
Interviewee:
So, he didn't talk about it a lot.
So, that's a little bit that I know.
I think he kind of wanted to forget about a lot of that.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Yeah, naturally.
I mean, that's tough.
It's crazy how much time's have changed since their generation.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Isn't it?
Interviewee:
Yeah, from not really having enough to eat all the time to now.
We're living in totally different worlds.
But yeah.
So, as far as his impact on me, certainly the way that he treated ... I guess it wasn't just books cause he had records, and the old LP's classical music that he collected as well.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
But even from a very young kid, I knew he'd dog ear a page, never highlight anything.
He'd never write in a book.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
He'd carry them around on a silk pillow.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Interviewee:
So, I picked up a lot of that.
