Interviewer: Okay, so, um, sentimentality seems to be like a pretty big deal in terms of, you know, why you think things are valuable. Would you say that's fair?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Alright. So, in your personal opinion, do you think you have too much stuff?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Alright, so, how do you know that?
Interviewee:
I’ve just got stuff everywhere. Um…
Interviewer: Right, so because it takes up so much space in your house?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer: Gotcha. So, I know we talked a little bit earlier about, you know, distinguishing between what's trash and what's worth keeping. But, if you were to say, choosing between keeping two items, what kinds of traits would you look at? Or, what kinds of things would you look at in terms of choosing the more important item to keep?
Interviewee:
If it’s something I would use or need.
Interviewer: Okay, usefulness, right?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer: Okay, anything else?
Interviewee:
No.
Interviewer: Alrighty. So, what are some things that you keep that you keep for the purpose of usefulness?
Interviewee:
Kitchen things that would be used. Uh… you know, bedroom-type things, towels washcloths.
Interviewer: Okay. And, are those things that you keep in normal amounts of, or things that you hoard a lot of?
Interviewee:
A lot of.
Interviewer: Gotcha. So, you know, um, these things that you hoard a lot of that are useful, do you think it's necessary to have them in so many, in such a big amount?  Or do you think that you just kind of, you know, choose to keep them around because you feel like they'll be useful later?
Interviewee:
I feel like they’ll be useful later.
Interviewer: Right. Okay, so, when it comes to, you know, trying to discard things, do you find it easier to discard something that might be useful or discard something that's sentimental to you?
Interviewee:
Something useful or what?
Interviewer: Or something that's sentimental to you?
Interviewee:
Probably I’d choose sentimental.
Interviewer: Okay. So, it's easier to throw away something that's sentimental to you?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer: Gotcha. Alright, so, now we're going to talk a little bit about how we distinguish hoarding disorder from, you know, normal behavior that is like collecting behavior. So, in your opinion, what do you think the most important differences are between, you know, what's considered normal and what's hoarding?
Interviewee:
Where you're having problems using rooms or walking
Interviewer: So, when it becomes like an obstacle in the house. That's an issue, right?
Interviewee:
Yes, yes.
Interviewer: Okay, anything else?
Interviewee:
No, I think that’s pretty much it. When you can’t use rooms or…
Interviewer: Mhmm. So, how was hoarding disorder, you know, by, by the normal definition, the same or different from your behavior?
Interviewee:
The same.
Interviewer: Very much the same?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
