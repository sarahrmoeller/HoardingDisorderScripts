Interviewer:
I can see that.
So you mentioned collecting those airline tickets, and the baggage tickets, and all those things.
So where do you draw the line between collecting and hoarding?
Participant 48:
Well, if there's literally no objective value, and if there's an extravagant surplus.
For example, I don't need any more notebooks.
I have enough notebooks.
I could part with some of the notebooks that I have.
But that's like a pretty hard thing for me to do.
Also, a number of things that I have here are things that I intend to sell.
There's several things in the bags here of things that I intended to give to Goodwill or the Salvation Army.
They're closed down, and I don't know what to do with it.
All the thrift stores effectively are shut down, so it's just taking up space here.
Interviewer:
So your consideration of hoarding would be an extravagance surplus of items.
Participant 48:
Or things that I can't perceive of an immediate use.
Things that I don't see as having a specific active on.
Interviewer:
So in our list making, you mentioned some behaviors contributing to hoarding disorder that are not related to inside the home would be individuals' interactions and their lack of social engagement.
Are there any other ways that you can tell if someone has hoarding disorder or issues with hoarding without being in their home.
Participant 48:
Again, other than just seeing them actively keep things that other people would discard.
Other than that, I don't really know how I'd recognize a hoarder without seeing the direct evidence.
Interviewer:
And-
Participant 48:
Are there ways?
[INAUDIBLE].
Eliminate.
Interviewer:
Well, this is, we are trying to get all of your perspectives on that.
So-
Participant 48:
Okay, all right.
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
Exactly.
So, no, that's great.
What you said is great.
Participant 48:
Oh, come to think of it, the homeless people who have parts of things.
I recognize that as hoarding.
And I understand where they're coming from, so seeing things that other people have thrown away, that they're keeping to have something, just to have stuff, I recognize that.
It's not useful to them.
It's a burden to them.
It makes their lives more difficult.
That's hoarding.
I can see that.
But as far as the people walking around shopping in stores and stuff, I can't tell who's a hoarder and who isn't.
Interviewer:
Right.
Where did you get information about hoarding disorder?
Where have you heard of it?
Participant 48:
I'm online a lot.
I read a lot.
I read at a postgraduate professional level.
I keep up with the National Academy of Sciences.
And I am ancillary membership to a number of different paraprofessional, professional things online.
And my therapist, she suggested a couple of books and gave me some handouts and stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So online, your therapist, and books.
