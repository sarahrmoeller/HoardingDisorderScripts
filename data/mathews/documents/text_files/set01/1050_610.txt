Participant 50:
Not an organizer, I did Google ads, but it didn't appear that it was covered by insurance, but I am in the care of a counselor and I am on medication and I have done group study things.
Interviewer:
Oh yeah.
So you've done the hoarding group?
Participant 50:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
And how did you find the person who you're seeing now?
How did you originally locate them and choose them?
And also how is the experience for you?
Participant 50:
I think I saw something like a flyer or something on the internet when I was trying to Google for help and it talks about going to get help and I put it in when I realized that this isn't something that I'm going to be able to ...
It's also when you feel like you're not the same person and that this is the one area in your life that for some odd reason you're missing the genes.
I did find something on the internet that led me to the place where I'm getting treatment and everything.
It took a long time for them to call me back and to the point where it was really bad and I was almost crying because they hadn't called me back.
But it's been really good.
I finally found the right person for me because there's no judgment and which gives me sometimes practical issues for my problem.
Participant 50:
And I don't mean it's not the 10 steps that you can find on the internet about cleaning your house, but just realizing that those 10 steps don't work for you because you don't process like other people.
And just being able to bounce things off to prioritize as well too.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like it was really important for the counselor that you're seeing to kind of validate that it's not your fault that you can't just clean up your apartment.
Participant 50:
Yes.
I think that's right.
