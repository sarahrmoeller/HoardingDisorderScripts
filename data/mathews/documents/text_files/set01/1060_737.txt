34:06 Interviewer:
Ok. So, I know you mentioned that you would; that you like are very attached to your sentimental and your nostalgic items. So, would you be upset it you had to get rid of some of your items? Like if something happened…
Participant:
I wouldn’t want to throw myself of a bridge. I have no wedding pictured whatsoever because mold got on them. But what it was it made me mad it didn’t make me hurt. You know? So that didn’t hurt that bad. So anytime I hear “[name] you can’t have this” I would actually get upset and say let me deal with it first. And I would try to shove as much stuff as I could in less containers. Seriously, I would. I would work it out some way. See that would upset me.
