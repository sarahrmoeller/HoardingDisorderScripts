Participant:
My son is totally different from the rest of us.
Interviewer:
So you would like to change your behavior?
Participant:
Yeah, I really would like to be that, organizer. That’s what I want to use. I would want to be an organizer. I’ve watched a few YouTube videos on it. You know, that one Chinese lady. Just to see how you do this. You know? So yeah I would.
Interviewer:
Ok. So, I know you mentioned that you would; that you like are very attached to your sentimental and your nostalgic items. So, would you be upset it you had to get rid of some of your items? Like if something happened…
Participant:
I wouldn’t want to throw myself of a bridge. I have no wedding pictured whatsoever because mold got on them. But what it was it made me mad it didn’t make me hurt. You know? So that didn’t hurt that bad. So anytime I hear “[NAME] you can’t have this” I would actually get upset and say let me deal with it first. And I would try to shove as much stuff as I could in less containers. Seriously, I would. I would work it out some way. See that would upset me.
Interviewer:
Ok.
Participant:
But not make me, you know, want to kill myself.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Participant:
It would just make me; It would make your life uncomfortable. But that way.
Interviewer:
Ok. So, that was the last question. So, now we just need to get some demographics. So, what is your gender identity?
Participant:
Female, straight. Is that how you say it?
Interviewer:
Yeah. Ok. Was that your sex…
Participant:
I know what I am.
Interviewer:
Was that your sex assigned at birth? Was female?
Participant:
Uh huh.
Interviewer:
ok. What’s your race?
Participant:
White, I guess. I don’t want to say I guess. I’m Italian.
Interviewer:

Participant:
But I don’t look like Italian. So I’m white.
Interviewer:
Do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?
Participant:

Interviewer:
And then could you give me a general household income? Just like a ballpark?
Participant:

Participant:

Interviewer:
And the highest level of education?
Participant:
Some college. I went to three years of law school.
Interviewer:
Oh ok. Um, did you complete a bachelor’s degree?
Participant:
No. We lived in STATE and my grandmother got a stroke. We moved to STATE because it was easier for her insurance. I, went to University of Florida wanting to go to their law school and I lost all my credits because it was a different state. So they sent me to Santa Fe and I just fumbled around.
Interviewer:
ok.
