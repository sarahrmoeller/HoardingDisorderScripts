Interviewer:
Okay. How about your physical health, any impact on that?
Participant 008:
Probably not. As a side effect, in the middle of COVID?
Interviewer:
Oh, no way.
Participant 008:
No, probably relationship between the two, other than strange being in a hospital this time.
Interviewer:
I know, right.
Participant 008:
[inaudible 00:55:22]. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, just for something completely different. 
Participant 008:
Yeah. Yeah. Going through the test, and yeah.  Isolation and being in the hospital that's almost empty, because you're in the non COVID part, and ...
Interviewer:
Right. Wow. How about your ... Oh, go ahead.
Participant 008:
Being [inaudible 00:55:45] they're very eager to push you through too. Like, I probably didn't want to have the appendectomy. What's the other options? But it's pretty much, no, you don't want to sit in the hospital right now. We need to get you out of here. So, we're just going to take you out and send you on your way.
Interviewer:
Well, I mean, got to love faster service, right?
Participant 008:
Yeah. I suppose.
Interviewer:
And what about your financial health, I guess you could call it? Has it affected ... Has COVID affected your family financially?
Participant 008:
Not really. Not significantly. We're probably spending a little less money.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. That's nice.
Participant 008:
Not going out to eat. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. And then, how about your overall mental health? You said the social aspect, has that made you feel more isolated?
Participant 008:
Yeah, probably a little bit. Yeah, I had to stop reading the news, but it's probably like a second order with COVID cause it seems like things have gotten a little more intense, of course, politics and everything else. So, that was getting to be too much to try to ... Just useless stress, I guess ...
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative) Yeah, definitely watching the news. 
Participant 008:
... Is the other way to describe that. But if anything, I'm kind of trying to almost be more isolated cause it seems like everything else has gotten crazier.
Interviewer:
Right. I mean, yeah, you can get lost in the news, and kind of ...
Participant 008:
Yeah, there's riots, and protests, and ...
Interviewer:
And yeah, be more anxious.
Participant 008:
... Fired up about politics. Yeah. Don't want to hear about it anymore, now that I brought it up.
Interviewer:
Right. So, how do you cope during this time? It seems like you were watching the news, and now you're not, and you're just kind of trying to avoid that because it was eliciting some emotions that you didn't want to deal with. Yeah, how else do you cope?
Participant 008:
Yeah, so that's probably pretty well captured, as far as coping with it and doing sort of online stuff with friends I wouldn't be doing otherwise. Then watching more ... We don't actually have a TV, but I have started watching more podcasts.
Interviewer:
Hmm.
Participant 008:
That sort of stuff.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 008:
I guess. Staying home more. So ...
