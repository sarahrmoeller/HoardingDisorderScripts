Interviewer:
Okay. To begin, as you know, this study is investigating individual attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question is what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 005:
Clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. Sounds great. Thank you. Once again, thank you for creating those lists. The next part of this Interviewer is more of a conversation. I will ask you some questions for you to answer and feel free to ask questions if you need clarification. If any question makes you uncomfortable just let me know and you don't need to answer that question.
Participant 005:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay. First, can you please describe your clutter and how long has this been going on?
Participant 005:
Describe my clutter? Things ... Is it best with an example? Like mail that has stacked up, that I haven't yet gotten to.
Interviewer:
Yeah or how severe would you say this behavior is?
Participant 005:
Moderate.
Interviewer:
Moderate? Okay. Do you think that this behavior has been a problem for you or for your family?
Participant 005:
It has definitely been an issue for at least I would say 30 years, maybe not as severe as it is now.
Interviewer:
Have you ever sought to change this behavior or have you ever gone to a professional or anything?
Participant 005:
I have never sought treatment. Honestly, I think I am just now starting to see it as a problem or as something that might be able to be fixed. You know, I think in the past it was just I was messy. Now it's clearly more than that.
Interviewer:
Okay. Have you ever had any conflicts with the people around you such as a landlord or family?
Participant 005:
Not a landlord but definitely with my daughter at times.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 005:
She's living at home again and there's certain things that have not moved out of certain rooms that are on their way somewhere else. You know, it just makes it hard to use that room.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Can you please describe where you live now? You might have mentioned it. Do you live alone? What is the space like in your home?
Participant 005:
I have a home, kind of one and a half stories, that I've only lived here for three years and my daughter moved back home a year ago. It's got three bedrooms and the downstairs is kind of a play room.
