Interviewer:
Okay. So, it sounds like mentally you've been a little more done and financially you're not able to work as much either?
Interviewee:
But financially it was okay because I was semi-retired so I have my pension income.
The wedding money was just like pin money.
I did it more because of the gratification and it was so wonderful to work with these couples as opposed to needing the money, so.
So, it's not a financial issue, it's feeling that I have purpose.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, it sounds like mostly it's been hard on you mentally-
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
... it's been causing more depression and stuff?
Interviewee:
Yeah, emotionally and mentally it's been difficult.
Interviewer:
Okay, but physically your health overall is good?
Interviewee:
I gained weight.
I've gained 10 pounds so I'm stress eating a bit more.
Other than that, my health has been okay except these last two weeks with all this smoke.
That's hit me, that's why I'm coughing a bit and stuff.
Otherwise, my health is fairly good.
Interviewer:
Has Covid affected your shopping habits?
Or has it helped-
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Yes?
Okay.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
How so?
Interviewee:
Whereas I used to enjoy browsing the grocery store and looking at the fruits and vegetables, now I order everything online and I go and they deliver it to the trunk of my car.
So, now I have a once a week online shopping experience.
I'm not going to even the drug stores, I order everything online through Amazon like vitamins, all the stuff that I would've gone and... I live in a walking neighborhood, so I used to walk everyday like four blocks down to where my shopping street is and wonder up and down and look in the store windows and maybe go in the book store or something.
So, now I'm doing everything online.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How about for other shopping, like you mentioned books or art supplies, other things that you collect, how has that affected that?
Interviewee:
Oh, I'm not collecting anything right now.
My purchases are all things I need.
I mean, even underwear I bought online.
So, I'm not really doing any shopping for anything that's like what I consider fun stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, Covid-19 has kind of stopped your shopping other than the necessities?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
It's funny, I was never a shopaholic or anything but I always like to browse, and I do love bookstores so if I went into a bookstore I always came out with something.
So, now it's I have to be more thoughtful about, you know, I read the book review, do I want to read this?
I can't get it at the library anymore because the library's closed so I have to either buy it either as an online copy or order it from a bookstore and go pick it up.
