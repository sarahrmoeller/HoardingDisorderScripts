Interviewer:
Okay. Then the next scenario.
John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or he decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.
He's worried he might get rid of a box he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy every room.
Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes.
His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.
Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.
He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
Do you think that this person should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How come?
Interviewee:
Lots of reasons, because that and eventually having empty boxes in every room and indicative of them as a problem.
It's probably a fire hazard and you said it was making him late, so it's affecting his job and stuff.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Okay.
Do you think this kind of behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
Probably.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Is this behavior similar or different to yours?
Interviewee:
Very different.
I don't have that kind of problem.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Now, let's go on to the next one.
Let's see.
John Doe has CDs that he keeps in cases in case he needs to use it in the future.
CDs occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom.
Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.
Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens, he is late usually, in getting to where he needs to be.
Okay.
Do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee:
Probably.
It will make sense.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How come?
Interviewee:
Well, I mean, I've probably got about a hundred CDs, if that many, and they're in a little container thing.
A little stand up shelf thing, and they're not in the way.
I can probably have 200 of them and do the same thing.
But if I had CDs in every room, then A, either you're talking thousands of CDs or B, somebody is just too sloppy and lazy to put them back into the shelf.
But either way, I think they probably need some help.
Interviewer:
All right.
You think this behavior requires treatment?
You said yes, right?
You mentioned that they would need to get help?
Interviewee:
Yeah, probably.
