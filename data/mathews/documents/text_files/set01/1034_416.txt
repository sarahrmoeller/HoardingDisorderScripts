Participant 34:
Been a very stressful situation and because he doesn't work, he's at home all the time. So you don't get that break from somebody that gives you the opportunity to look at other things, do other things and not react, not be always waiting for somebody to say or do something. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. It gives you a break from looking at the person. 
Participant 34:
Exactly, exactly. So everybody is, if you're quarantining at home with your family members and getting to know them all too well, it's like that. But it's been like that for the whole two years that I've been living with this person. And it's rarely a break, a sense of being in my own space and not having to go around cleaning up after someone who's not particularly conscious of-
Interviewer:
The mess they're creating. 
Participant 34:
The mess they're creating or doesn't have the understanding that there's three stages to say, having a meal. You get things together to prepare it, you get your utensils, your ingredients, whatever and make your sandwich or your souffle or whatever it is and then when you serve it, when you're finished, you don't just set down things where they are and assume they'll be taken care of by the clean up fairy. 
Interviewer:
Which is you. 
Participant 34:
There's an ending process, a cleaning up and putting away, recreating the status quo ante that is of the situation that was before. Put things back to the way they were before you started making your sandwich or creating that dish or whatever. 
Interviewer:
It sounds like that could be-
Participant 34:
For the next person who walks into the space finds it as expected. And so it's basic consideration of others with whom you live that's lacking, that's like okay, I'm done with this can. Drop it. Okay, I've drunk half this bottle of soda, set it down on something, where it'll sit for weeks. 
Yeah, and his children have the same habits. So it's like, difficult to break through because they're, a condition, not of behavior I can change, but so it's like okay, sure. Thanks for the explanation. Now I'm your maid and your clean up lady as well as your rent payer. It drives me nuts. 
Interviewer:
That's too much. And you mentioned the stress that that brings to you. How are you coping with that or getting some distance from it when you're not really able to leave your house and see other people conveniently? 
Participant 34:
Well, sometimes leaving the house and seeing other people is part of it and getting out to see friends, that's, part of it is, I belong to a couple of senior organizations. And their meeting's online now. And I'm in an addiction recovery group that's online that I participate in meetings there, as well. So those are ways to cope.
