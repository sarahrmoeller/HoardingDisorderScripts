Interviewer:
But you you've resisted the urge to fill them with your items.
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, is there anything else you can think of, like, for example, some people will not be able to use their bathtub, because there are so many objects.
Participant:
Oh, I see. Uh, no, no, no, we’re alright for that.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, and then moving on to our next section, which is on value when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?
Participant:
And I think their familiarity and their potential.
Interviewer:
Okay. So what is trash for you, like, what do you discard?
Participant:
Into the trash? Something that's broken or something that's dirty, or stained. Something that… yeah
Interviewer:
So something that is just no longer and its original, like original state?
Participant 059 -
Yeah
Interviewer:
Okay. And so, you've mentioned it before. Um, how your books and baskets are the most precious items in your house for you. So, what would happen if you lost them?
Participant:
Well you know I think about that. Think about sharing. If I were going to share them even just not using them and it’s like, I feel distraught about that. UNCLEAR You know, I’d rather share money you know than share these things, which is interesting. They don't have a… I guess probably they're like hard to find. So, they would be difficult to replace with money, whereas money. I work right so I can replace the money, but things that are one off, odd things. I got at thrift stores and found you know hunting hunting and gathered and found a basket or this thing in a trash can, you know, so, so the value I guess is in the acquisition of it. It’s monetary value.
Interviewer:
Right so you value more the like the uniqueness and like, like you said, the acquisition more than more than necessarily even money.
Participant:
Right than the Monetary value of it.
Interviewer:
Right, okay.
Participant:
Like my grandma with her stack of Penny Saver magazines are worth zero dollars when you could not get her to part with one of them, you know.
Interviewer:
And like you've mentioned you are aware that you have too much stuff. Um, but how do you know that, like, how do you decide when you have too much?
