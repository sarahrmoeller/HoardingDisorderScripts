Participant:
Uh, there, there was a kid's, um [inaudible; (19:22)]. I’m sorry, one second.
Interviewer (19:23): No worries.
Participant:
Yeah um, there was a kid’s toy kitchen set. It was in the laundry room, and it was in the way, and when my sister moved in she brought a bunch of her crap down. So, when you try to fit two women in, uh, like 100 square feet, with all the stuff, it just, you know… But it was, it was so bad before the storage room, it was not safe for me to go in there.
Interviewer (19:49): Gotcha. So, when you say unsafe, do you mean like there was things—
Participant:
I could have tripped over it.
Interviewer (19:56): —things that could’ve fallen down or tripped over?
Participant:
Yeah, tripped over things in there because there was a lot of stuff in there. There was, there was paint. Painting have been that prior, different things like that.
Interviewer (20:06): Okay, so, in the spaces that you do hoard things, is there any sort of like, organization to how you put things, or did you have a certain method for how you might stack things or place things?
Participant:
Um, well, for example, I’m trying to go through some costume jewelry. I’ve got crews of costume jewelry. And, I have this big imagination of ways I can display this up because I would want to have a yard sale when all this craziness is over.
Interviewer (20:32): Right.
Participant:
Uh, but just giving it out. I’ve got this big, big container, and I’m just trying to go through it. It's just, it's a challenge.
Interviewer (20:43): Yeah, for sure.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer (20:46): So, in your childhood, in your past, I know you said that your sister now living with you has definitely taken issue with some of these behaviors and your second husband, but, um, when you were growing up at all, your parents never really had an issue with you keeping stuff? Or maybe your friends now, did they ever have issues with you keeping stuff?
Participant:
Well, my one that just passed would not have any, because she was a major hoarder.
Interviewer (21:15): Really?
Participant:
Hers was om medications, yeah.
Interviewer (21:21): Oh, so she would hoard medications?
Participant:
Yeah, yeah. And um, as a kid the only thing that I can recall that was very irritating is my older sister, which just now passed. She used to wear my clothes and, and, you know, that was okay. But, when she would get home, she would lounge there all day long, she’d smoke in my clothes and everything was horrible. So, I'm you know, I'm also clothes hoarder. That's part of that, yeah.
Interviewer (21:49): Okay, so your experiences with your sister and your childhood have, um, contributed to you hoarding clothes?
Participant:
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Interviewer (21:58): Okay, so what kind of clothes do you hoard, and how do you keep them?
