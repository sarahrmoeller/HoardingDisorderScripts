Participant 011:
Well, the older I get, the less attached I am to all this stuff and I've begun to realize that.
I could probably just have my family and cousins come out here, but I don't get along with all of them, so I don't want them to go picking between my houses for things that they're waiting for me to die to get anyway.
So how I feel about that, I've got to keep their hands off of this stuff until I'm gone, but I'd like to have it all cataloged before I go.
So that's what I'm trying to do, so that everybody gets a piece of the pudding.
But yeah, in a way I could have people come out, family come out, and start taking things away from me.
And that's hard for me to get into yet.
I may be able to get into that another year or so.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 011:
And actually have certain parts of my family come out and start to ransack my belongings.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 011:
But I'd rather give it to them while I'm alive and that way I could at least feel good about it.
Other than having a fight over this stuff when I'm dead, which they're going to do anyway.
And so that's what happens when you have a lot of collection.
Clutter is also collecting things, and so there's probably a fine line between the clutter and the collector.
A lot of collectors are clutterers.
I know that for fact, because I am one.
But I'm also a collector, so I appreciate certain things.
Yeah, so I'm stuck with all this.
And I'm going to get rid of it.
I'm not not attached.
Like I told you, I have only this sentimental attachment and the art attachment.
So other than that, it can all go.
There's all these antiques and vintage things, they call them, and those all have values.
So there's values attached to everything, and so I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff.
I suppose I need someone to come and just take all these books and things and just get rid of them for me.
Interviewer:
Does your-
Participant 011:
And that's probably the most difficult thing.
