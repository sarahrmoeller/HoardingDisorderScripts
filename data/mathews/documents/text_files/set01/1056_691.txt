Interviewer : Okay, so what areas in particular do you keep your things?
Participant:
I am allowed to keep my things in the garage.
Interviewer : Okay.
Participant:
In my office, and in my son’s bedroom who has moved out ten years ago.  College, you know for college, has not moved back in.
Interviewer : So, if you were to describe the areas where you do keep your things, you know like the garage or your son’s room, what would you describe them as looking like?
Participant:
Well, my son’s room is the worst because it’s full of his stuff, which I have on many occasions asked which of his stuff I can get rid of. And so far he has not, um, felt a need to purge any of the stuff that he has because, you know, he’s got his own living space and this doesn’t bother him because he’s not here, and his room has not yet been hijacked for other purposes. So, that room is cluttered, full of kid’s stuff— toys and clothes, toys mostly and some clothes, but mostly just toys and his childhood furniture. Um, my office is full of all sorts of things like old electronics, and computers, and stereos and things that still work just fine, but I have not been able to find the right home for. Although, periodically I put things on Craigslist, now is definitely not a very good time to try to sell stuff on Craigslist. Everybody is locked up at home and I would think that they would all be online looking for stuff to get, but apparently that’s not the case.
Interviewer : Right.
Participant:
Um, and I have retained my, um, library of books and textbooks from forever and ever. And, unfortunately since my child had lots of toys and stuffed animals some of them are in there as well, and um, there’s boxes of cars, things, assorted wall hanging that have one time or another been on walls but are currently just stacked up in there. And when a, uh, ancestor passed away a few years ago, I became the custodian of all the family photo albums dating back to, to the 1930s and there’s hundreds of them.
Interviewer : Right.
Participant:
Nobody else in the family will take them so I’m stuck with them, and I don’t have an issue holding on to them until someone either decides that they are interested or until I INAUDIBLE them and they can throw them out if they want to.
Interviewer : Right. So, you mentioned that you definitely are a more of an organized person, so there’s a level of organization to your stuff for your rooms that have your stuff in them.
Participant:
To some degree, but when the other citizen moved in here that became a little more of a challenge because my space that was allocated to me became compressed and I had to fit more stuff into less space. And on a now basis, so some organization has been lost.
