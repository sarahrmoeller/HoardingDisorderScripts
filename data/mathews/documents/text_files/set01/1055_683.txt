Interviewer (22:42): Right. Did it ever cause any conflict between her and you?
Participant:
Yes, because of me not being able to have friends over because of the chaos.
Interviewer (22:53): Okay, so you've kind of experienced what you mentioned earlier that your husband has an issue with now, right?
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer (23:02): Okay, so, I could imagine it's easy for you to sympathize with him because you've experienced that before.
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer (23:10): Right. So, when you guys talk about having people over or not being able to have people over, you know, what kinds of things are said in those conversations?
Participant:
Well, that he wants me to get it cleaned up.
Interviewer (23:25): Right.
Participant:
He just wants me to throw everything in the trash.
Interviewer (23:31): And, what do you usually respond with? What, what do you tell him?
Participant:
That I’m going to move it [laughing].
Interviewer (23:37): Mhmm. Alright, so, in terms of your possessions, what do you think makes them valuable or worth keeping around?
Participant:
It’s mental. Um… I was looking for something that may be valuable, um, worth something.
Interviewer (24:03): So, by that do you mean that you go out shopping looking for these things?
Participant:
No, not really anymore. Not much. It's just, you know, now, these things are here. So…
Interviewer (24:26): Mhmm. Alright, so, sentimentality is definitely important for you in terms of what makes your things valuable. But, how about like money or like actual monetary value?
Participant:
Well, that's what I keep hoping for I guess.
Interviewer (24:42): Right. So, anything in particular that you keep around because you hope it'll kind of accumulate money or value?
Participant:
Well, I have some old money. Like, Confederate money that I kept. Uh…
Interviewer (25:02): Anything else like that, or no?
Participant:
No, not that I can think of at all.
Interviewer (25:09): Gotcha. Okay, so, on the other side of the spectrum, what's trash for you? So, like, what's something that you have no issue at all throwing away?
Participant:
Well, I don't, I don’t know. Food wrappers, things like that. Uh… um… boxes. Like I don’t like to look at them. Uh, I think that’s about it.
Interviewer (25:36): Gotcha. Okay, so certain things are for you, really easy to throw away and you don't have any desire to keep them, right?
Participant:
Right.
Interviewer (25:45): Okay, so, in terms of the items that you have in your house, what's your most precious item?
Participant:
Um, pictures.
Interviewer (25:57): Okay. So, are these like pictures and picture frames, or like photo albums?
Participant:
Well, I just have boxes that are just like pictures waiting there.
Interviewer (26:11): Mhmm. Alright, so, why are these pictures valuable for you?
Participant:
Memories.
Interviewer (26:17): Okay. So, if you were to suddenly lose these pictures, it would be pretty upsetting for you because of the memory that’s lost, right?
Participant:
Right.
