Interviewee:
I think it is genetic because, like I said to you, I look back in my family, I see some similarities in some of the people in my family of the same kind of clutter habits I have.
And in the old days, they did it differently.
But it was the same type of deal so it may just be a family trait.
That's what I want to know, if it's a family trait or not, and you guys can prove that.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Interviewee:
And I still want to know where the funding comes from.
Who funds this and what do they get out of it?
I can research it on the web, but you should know that.
You should know who's funding it for your own benefit.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you have any questions about the funding too, you can email Interviewer because she's the mainly the one in charge of funding.
Interviewee:
Yeah, I could ask her.
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay.
Interviewee:
I know there's a couple of grants that University of Florida got, and I don't know if they were the bequest grants or if they were government grants or if they were pharmaceutical grants.
But I would like to know where the grant money came from and for what purpose.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Interviewee:
Those are the things in my mind that I'd like to clarify.
I mean, it has nothing to do with me personally, but I like to know where funds come from and how they come about.
And if it's really a good study, then it could be a real asset for all of us.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I agree.
Interviewee:
Not just the hoarding community, but for everybody.
And it may break into other areas where there's problems, compulsions, and things like that.
So I'm sort of thinking pharmaceuticals are heading in this direction.
Not that a pill is going to keep a person from collecting things, but there may be some medication coming down the tube somewhere that would keep people from collecting boxes in their bathrooms and things like that, like you mentioned.
Okay.
I'll get off the air.
Thank you so much.
Interviewer:
Yeah, thank you.
Have a good rest of the day.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Interviewee:
All right.
Okay.
Bye.
