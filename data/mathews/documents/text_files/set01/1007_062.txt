Interviewer:
Okay. Besides that big surgery, how is your mental health or overall well-being been?
Participant 007:
I am an introvert. [INAUDIBLE] introvert and even I have had, sometimes I go, "Geez, it'd be nice to be able to go and see someone." Another thing that it has done is impact my ability to drive. My best friend lives about three and a half hours away. I cannot physically drive to see her because my leg was severely impacted by the spinal stenosis. It still has not recuperated. I can't have it in one position for more than about 20 minutes when you're driving.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 007:
It's impossible for me to go visit my best friend. We can talk on the phone, but I'm really okay. Given a choice between being in a crowd and being alone, give me alone. So, from the point of view of social isolation, I almost welcome it because I am very introverted.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 007:
And I think that might be something to look at, too, if these people are introverts or extroverts. To see if that would have an impact on their clutter problems.
Interviewer:
No, that's a very interesting concept to think about because most times people tend to live alone or they also comment that they're introverts. So, has COVID affected your buying habits? Do you tend to shop a lot?
Participant 007:
Not really. I don't go to the store very much because the stores around here, on 75, stores around here, have the senior hours from six to seven A.M. which I appreciate that they have senior hours, but, yeah, six to seven A.M. is not a time I'm up and about. Bright eyed and bushy tailed. I, as I said, am grateful that they have the shopping hours, but I don't get out to them too much. I'll get things online. I know that that is one issue that people in my situation have, is buying too much online.
Interviewer:
Would you say you've been buying a lot online? Like more than normal?
Participant 007:
I don't think more than normal. No, I don't think more than normal. I try to be more conscious about it and not get too carried away with online shopping. I know it can be a very dangerous habit to have.
Interviewer:
Yes, it's very easy to click a button.
Participant 007:
Oh, yes, too easy. CROSSTALK You can imagine it's the same thing because I have been to very many casinos, but when I lived in Philadelphia, when Atlantic city casinos first opened back in the early 70s, and there was a conference there that co-workers and I went to, and we agreed that we could spot at this casino because none of us had ever been. I took a roll of quarters and kept the quarters, I put them in my left pocket, and I would put them in. This was physical where you pull the one armed bandit and pull it down, and the things go around.
Interviewer:
Oh yeah.
