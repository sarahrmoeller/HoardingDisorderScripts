Interviewee:
Then you add to it, my son is in school in Finland, so all of his stuff, guess where it is?
Interviewer:
It's in your house.
Interviewee:
Yeah, yeah. It becomes, when you are the depository of family things, my mother would say ... She passed away in 2011, but she would say, "It's just stuff. It's just [INAUDIBLE]," and, somehow, you feel obliged to watch out for it and it goes beyond just sentimental to, I don't know what the word is that I'm searching for, but it's beyond sentimentality and becomes almost an obligation to preserve whatever the memory is.
Interviewer:
You feel like a sense of responsibility, maybe? Or?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I think so.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Then I procrastinate about things. I have a whole box of photographs that I should go through and scan in and identify while I still have memory to identify. It's very easy to procrastinate. I'm very good. I'm a professional procrastinator.
Interviewer:
Okay. You mentioned you have a son, but how does your family and friends feel about your difficulties with clutter? [CROSSTALK]
Interviewee:
Yes, my daughter is very, very unhappy about it. Fortunately, I'm very grateful to say that she doesn't seem to have the hoarding gene or, at least, she hasn't given in to it, I guess is the word I'm wanting to say. So, I'm grateful for that, but I know that it drives her nuts and she wouldn't invite anyone inside my house, and I wouldn't blame her.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm . How 'bout your son?
Interviewee:
He's accepting of it because he's not home that often, so when he is home, he realizes he wants a place to stay. There's a dining area off my kitchen that [INAUDIBLE] private, so he sleeps there. If he doesn't sleep there, he has to find another place to sleep.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
He pretty much has no choice in the matter.
Interviewer:
Okay. Can you describe your place a little bit? You mentioned it was a one bedroom. Do you live with a partner?
Interviewee:
No. No, no, I live alone, thank goodness.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Maybe if I lived with someone, maybe it would be neater.
Interviewer:
It's possible, but sometimes ...
Interviewee:
I could still hide things. I know that I would still hide things and try to hold on to things, but have it in the boxes, in the corners. My former husband was something of a pack rat, too, so between the two of us, it was a disaster.
