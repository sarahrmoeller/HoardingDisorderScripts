And I would find things that had belonged to me in my parents' house, that they were using. That they kept, effectively stolen from me when I was in jail. And they're not bad people. They're, that's a source of frustration. And also, we moved like every few years. My dad was military. And just discarded, effectively moving, changing your life entirely. And I went to nine schools in 12 years. I moved 14 times.
Interviewer:
Wow. Yeah
Participant 48:
But the thing is, in my circumstances, that was normal. I lived with other people who did the same thing. Surrounded by people for whom this is normal. 
Interviewer:
So out of all of your things, what's trash for you, and what do you discard? And how do you decide when it's time to throw something away?
Participant 48:
When I'm going through things, and I perceive that it's not usable, I'll just shred it. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 48:
If it's something that evokes a negative association, or a negative memory, I'll sometimes discard it. If it's worn, if I already have other replacement, if I can't think of a use, even though, with all my projects and stuff. There's a microwave that broke, [inaudible 00:46:36] microwave. But I looked, and it turns out that a microwave has a lot of great parts, a lot of things you can do cannibalizing a microwave. I haven't gotten around to it yet. I have the old microwave in a corner to do that anyway. But I don't know. A lot of it-
Interviewer:
Yeah, so when-
Participant 48:
When I have to, yeah, when I have to do it, when I have to make it look orderly or pass for an inspection, in those 24 hours, I am hyper PTSD, stressed out, and then I make, I get rid of things because they take up too much space. They don't fit. Yeah, things that I would otherwise keep, but I realize that I have a few hours. I have to get this done.
Interviewer:
Right. So things can be discarded if they're worn, they carry negative emotions, they're unusable, things of that sort, yeah. I get that.
Participant 48:
I travel a lot, too. And invariably, when I come back, I'll have the airline tickets, the luggage stickers, all the flyers and things of the trips we went on, like Iceland, the horses and the ice cave, and all that kind of stuff. And I keep that. Intending to, for no good reason. But I intend, at some point, to make a collection of that. Have a, like an album or whatever to show my travels.
Interviewer:
Right, so-
Participant 48:
Because then I could see them. But yeah, it can take up time. And when you're trying to throw things away and you go through that, you end up having to deal with each one of them piece by piece, it makes the two weeks fly by.
Interviewer:
That makes sense. Well, I have some demographic questions for you, and then I want to make sure to get your address. And I can send you a gift card to say, thank you for your time on the phone with me today and last week. It's up to you if you would prefer to receive an electronic gift card by email, we can send you it right away. Or we can put a Visa gift card for you in the mail. Do you have a preference?
Participant 24:
No, I'd rather have one in the mail. I don't have a printer that's working now.
Interviewer:
Yeah. You don't need a printer. You could just use it on Amazon or whatever to buy things online. But if you don't buy things online, then it's better to send you something in the mail.
Participant 24:
No, I think I'd really have one sent to me.
Interviewer:
Okay. So I'm just going to ask you the demographic questions. So I'm going to go ahead and guess that you're female.
Participant 24:
Yes.
