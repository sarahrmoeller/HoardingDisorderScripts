Interviewer:
Your telescopes you value because you can learn things about space and different things like that.
Participant 021:
Right.
Interviewer:
Is that what you're saying?
Participant 021:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So then how do you describe what is trash for you or what you discard?
Participant 021:
How do I describe what is trash?
Interviewer:
Yeah, so when you're looking at something, you're like, "To me this is trash."
For me, when I look at a wrapper, I'm like, "Oh, that's trash.
I have to get rid of this," you know?
Participant 021:
Oh, yeah, when it comes to things like garbage and wrappers and old paper and old boxes, I get rid of those.
I don't have a lot of garbage laying around in my house.
But there are things that I sort of know are trash but I struggle even so with getting rid of them.
I could give you an example.
I bought an old, old clock at an auction once, and it's very old.
I looked at it and it didn't quite work, and I took it... I played around with it.
I decided I couldn't get it running, so I looked it up online, and there are people that collect old clocks.
I found this clock that somebody was selling, and they were asking $75 for it, so to me it has some value because people collect it.
But mine is in pieces and it's really trash, and it's... I picked that clock up probably five times and said, "All right, put it in the car.
Next time I'm out, I'm going to get rid of it, donate it, throw it out, whatever," because it's pieces.
But I know that it has value to somebody, and if I could connect with that person, I could sell it to them.
I probably wouldn't get 75 bucks for it, but I probably could get 15 or 20 dollars for it.
To me, I know it's trash in the condition it's in.
I'll never get it back together but it has value at the same time.
Interviewer:
Kind of like, correct me if I'm wrong, but what I'm understanding is that you're holding onto it because you know it has some value in someone else's eyes, but you don't necessarily see it as valuable?
Participant 021:
Right.
It has no value to me because I'll never get it running, but I know it has value, and it's just a matter of meeting the right person.
