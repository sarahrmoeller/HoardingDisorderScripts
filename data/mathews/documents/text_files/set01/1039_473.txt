Interviewer:
A bigger clutter volume?
Okay.
Gotcha.
Is there a way to tell, we kind of talked about this a little bit but I just want to ask again.
Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
You talked about flea markets or people wearing those different color shirts, is there anything else you can think of?
And the compulsive-
Interviewee:
Well, occasionally I have walking the street or walking some place, I'm very aware of the person if they lean down and pick up off the ground either on the sidewalk or on the ground something that, some people have a phobia about picking up anything that is on the ground, particularly on the sidewalk in a public place.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
If I see somebody do that I have often thought, "Oh, they save things like I save things."
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Seeing that similar saving behavior?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Gotcha.
Can you notice that when you go into their home or can you notice that when you're just speaking with them and they start talking about the stuff that they save?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Sometimes people do that.
I usually would chime in and say, "Well, if you think your habit is bad, you should see mine."
Interviewer:
Right.
Totally.
Okay.
Now we're going to go into another section of our interview.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to read these stories.
These are just little stories about someone that might have hoarding disorder or might not, so I want you after I read it to tell me whether or not you think this person has hoarding disorder or maybe they just have issues with clutter.
That make sense?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in.
He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms.
His house is not always organized but it is usually not cluttered.
Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.
Do you think that this person has hoarding?
Interviewee:
Definitely.
Interviewer:
And why do you think that?
