Interviewer:
Yeah. And for this next scenario, John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.
He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.
He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.
Antiques occupy every room, and before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.
Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.
He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
So once again, do you believe John=
Interviewee:
Yeah, Mr. John Doe needs to open an antique shop immediately.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
And move it all out of his house and move it into the store and hire someone to sell it for him.
Yeah, that's the same kind of problem.
Again, like I told you, there's the differentiation between a collector and a hoarder.
And if people start hoarding their antiques in their...
Yeah, I know people do that too, and I had an aunt who actually...
She had wonderful collections of certain types of antiques, but she was probably a hoarder, and even though she kept them in two or three different rooms.
But I was wondering, maybe I inherited some of that.
But the antique story's same as the previous one, to tell you the truth.
It's a clutter problem.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE, okay.
And so for this last part of the interview, we're going to be talking about COVID, and again, I will ask-
Interviewee:
Oh, really?
Interviewer:
Yes.
So I will, again, ask you some questions and just let me know if you need any clarification or you feel uncomfortable answering any of the questions.
Interviewee:
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, how has COVID impacted your life such as...
What specific behaviors have changed for you?
Interviewee:
COVID has affected my...
PART 3 OF 4 ENDS
Interviewee:
COVID has affected my life.
It's more distance from socializing with people that I've previously socialized with an organization.
I was a volunteer.
Some of my volunteer jobs, I'm no longer a volunteer doing.
Consequently, I'm more alone now than I was previously.
The positive side of COVID is I've reached out to my family a little more so than I have in the past and I'm communicating with them more so that's a plus side.
But the downside is yeah, I'm less in contact with people around me in my vicinity where I live so it's not healthful.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
That makes sense.
Yeah.
