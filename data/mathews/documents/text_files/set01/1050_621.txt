Participant 50:
But if a person is very fearful of being discovered, I think that they probably put on a facade and I think that they will do anything not to be discovered.
Because if you look at the hoarding specials and stuff, kids will say, "I didn't know I got this bad."
So the person on the phone is going to talk like there's not a care in the world or anything, or they're not going to complain about their space.
They may complain about the rent or whatever.
So unless they tell you, sometimes they're not going to be able to just discover, because I think that there's more of us walking amongst them to various degrees, just that certain people have worse cases than other people.
Interviewer:
Definitely.
Participant 50:
I don't think-
Interviewer:
Yeah, go ahead.
Participant 50:
I don't think you can look at stuff yourself.
Interviewer:
Yeah, so it sounds like you definitely could have ordering disorder and nobody could know if they didn't see your space.
And probably there's a lot of people who have varying degrees that are able to hide it and kind of keep it under wraps.
And it also sounds like you said that sometimes people might be able to see your workspace or see some other space and maybe think that you're not organized, but that for the most part, it's something that is easily hidden.
Where do you learn about hoarding disorder?
Where do you go to get information about it?
You mentioned reading about it and learning about it.
What are the main sources of information you have about it?
Participant 50:
I usually look at the internet.
I've gotten a few books on hoarding on Audible.
So I'm one of those people that I tried to do the research.
That's why when I go to them, if they're just like five easy steps, it doesn't quite work for me unless there's that other component to be able to talk my language, if that makes sense.
But mostly internet and books.
Interviewer:
That totally makes sense.
Do you watch the hoarding reality TV shows?
