Interviewer:
Do you have any opinions about that show and how it depicts hoarding disorder? From any personal experiences that you’ve had?
Participant:
Yeah, I mean, I think it definitely depicts them in maybe a more of a negative connotation I think even like a lot of my descriptive words for hoarding in the free list and things like that kin do portray that idea that like there’s definitely something more going on rather than just their hoarding disorder you know that it might be exacerbated by some underlying mental issue or something like that.
Interviewer:
So, so, yes, you mentioned so anxiety and depression. Have you ever had any difficulties with any of these uncomfortable feelings and have they led you to maybe unnecessarily hold onto things in the past that would be any, like, concerning hoarding behavior? Considered concerning hoarding behavior? Or issues with clutter?
Participant:
No, I mean I can’t, I can’t really think of anything of the top of my head.
Interviewer:
Okay, so this was, I didn’t know, this was supposed to be an interview with people who have issues with clutter or hoarding disorder, which I know some people who have issues with clutter don’t necessarily find their behavior concerning but maybe it leads to other interpersonal problems with family or different things, but you said earlier you do not have hoarding disorder, and from talking to you I, my impression is that you don’t seem to have any issues with clutter, sorry, it’s never caused any issues with anyone in your life?
Participant:
Yeah that’s correct.
Interviewer:
Okay, so I don’t know if the, if the rest of the question would apply. Do you think you have too much stuff?
Participant:
No, I don’t think so, I mean, we, you know we recently moved from Utah to Florida and so we tried to consolidate quite a bit of our stuff. So, yeah it wouldn’t, I wouldn’t necessarily say that we have too much stuff. Necessary, unnecessary stuff.
Interviewer:
Have you, okay, I’m looking over the questions. So would you say that in any way, hoarding causes any sort of issues in your daily life?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. Is there anything that you would like to change about the way that you keep or get rid of some items?
