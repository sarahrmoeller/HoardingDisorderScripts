Interviewer:
Okay. Okay. Um, so now we'll move on to our second section which is about space and living area. Um, so I know that you've said that, like your dining room table. And like your kitchen and stove are like not very usable because there's so much stuff, but could you please describe like just describe your house and you said that it takes some time to maneuver. So, can you just elaborate on that.
Participant:
It's mostly paper or magazines. On the stove mostly paper magazines, on the table. And then there's a table in between the living room and the den, because I intermittently work from home. So that's where I set up and I decided just to leave it there. And now this papers on top of that and cards because I love sending cards to people. And then this. I mean, I'm looking at this, my all my Christmas stuff clean sitting on top of a plastic container that needs to be put away. And all this other stuff I cleaned and then the couch in the living room has clothes stacked up to the ceiling and then the chair and this den sitting in has 1, 2, 3 boxes and hundred pieces of paper. And there's the dog. He's clean And then I have a spare bedroom that, I got so lazy, I just put all my gardening stuff in it, which is horrible because the floors are all hard wood and they’re gorgeous. And there's like maybe a 6 by 6 feet tall thing of all gardening stuff, stuffed back there and I put all my plants out there in there, but now they're out. And I did start cleaning cupboards or at least they're a little bit better. My bedroom I’m looking in it. There's a rack with all clean clothes, the bed has all clean clothes, boxes of clean clothes. Oh, yeah.
Interviewer:
And I know that you said that you have a dog. But other than that, you live alone.
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, and what would you like your house to look like?
Participant:
I want all of the boxes and papers either recycled, composted, or put somewhere. Another stacks. It's the problem. I keep telling myself, “most of the things I have, you can find this online.” If I see an interesting article on local such and such. I gotta read that local teas, local dining, local chocolates. And I'll just keep stacking everything up. But I'm like “I can find that online.” I've no idea what is the point in this. Looking at it…
Interviewer:
So you said that you, you collect a lot of papers and your houses like obviously filled with papers. And is that just because you feel like you want to read them again like?
Participant:
Yeah
