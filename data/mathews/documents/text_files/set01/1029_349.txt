Interviewer:
Thank you.
This is actually my first interview I've done with this project.
So thank you for that.
Interviewee9:
Well, you've done a good job.
You can go on with confidence.
Interviewer:
Thank you.
Do you have a few more minutes where I can ask you about specifically COVID-19 and spending the time alone, how that's impacted you?
Interviewee9:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So right off the bat, how has quarantine impacted your life?
Interviewee9:
Well, it made me realize, like in the first two weeks, I realized how active I really am.
I didn't realize I was as busy as I am with friends and my volunteer job, how much I was on the go all the time.
So, that was the first realization.
And I had been feeling tired, and I thought, "Now I know why."
It also has helped me get more rest.
I made the decision that because of my age, and I've been having some problems with my throat and I thought.
This is not a good time to be out among people.
So I made the decision that I was going to do my best to not go into places.
So, I do my grocery shopping by curbside only.
Anything I need to buy, if I've had to buy anything from a store it's been curbside pickup.
Interviewer:
And-
Interviewee9:
Go ahead.
Interviewer:
Continue with your sentence, sorry for interrupting.
Interviewee9:
No, I wasn't sure if I was answering the right question.
I stopped to think, "Okay, exactly what did she ask me?"
Interviewer:
I just asked you very generally.
So now I'll ask you some more specific stuff.
How has quarantine and not going out as much affected your acquiring new items?
Interviewee9:
Not at all.
Because I really wasn't doing much shopping anyway.
I ordered two things online that I had been wanting anyway.
So ordered those no matter what, but I haven't ordered any clothes.
So I've stayed out of all the stores, and I only online ordered two things that I needed.
So I would say it hasn't affected that.
But, I had really cut way back on my shopping a few years ago.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And how has being in your home more frequently affected efforts to declutter?
Interviewee9:
Initially, I was doing really well.
I thought, "Okay, I'm going to really get things in order."
So I have filled four decent boxes with papers that, when this is over, I need to take somewhere for shredding.
Initially I thought I can shred these, but then when I realized how many I had, I thought, I don't think I have enough life left to shred all these papers.
