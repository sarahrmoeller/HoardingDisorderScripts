Interviewer: Right. So, when you had to accommodate your collections to somebody else, did you find that easy or was it difficult at first to get used to?
Participant:
Uh, it was a challenge.
Interviewer: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about that.
Participant:
Well again, it seems to me that with each passing month or season or whatever that I’m being squashed into a smaller portion. I’ve been told that by Christmas my son’s room needs to be cleared out.
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
Cause there’s gonna be company, and they need that room to be um, laying out their stuff while they’re staying here.
Interviewer: Right. So, the room as is doesn’t really have enough room for someone else to be living in there?
Participant:
Right. It’s a clutter room.
Interviewer: Okay, so, what about the non-clutter rooms in your house? Do they look normal or presentable?
Participant:
Absolutely.
Interviewer: Okay. So, it’s really just confined to those certain areas of the house then?
Participant:
The areas that I’m allowed to clutter.
Interviewer: Right, okay. So, um, aside from being in someone’s home and kind of like being able to see whether they keep stuff or if certain rooms have a lot of things in them, how would you be able to tell if someone does hoard without being in their home? So, like what kind of personality traits do you think that you would witness in someone?
Participant:
I have no idea.
Interviewer: Okay. So, in terms of yourself, do you think that there’s any sort of traits that might give away that you like to keep things?
Participant:
Um… I’m… I may not be insightful in recognizing that I have traits that someone might see as being a hoarder-type person. But um, I don’t think that anyone would be able to guess that my office looks like my office looks.
Interviewer: Right. So, I know we talked a bit about um, determining whether things should be kept based on whether they have some sort of tactical use or whether you could make some money off of them. So maybe in recognizing those kinds of traits like uh, maybe like uh, financially focused in terms of things or like tactical or maybe even sentimental. Do you think those kinds of traits would maybe be a give to you whether someone might hoard or collect a lot of things?
Participant:
Um… again maybe my perception is not acute enough that I would pick up on things like that.
Interviewer: Okay. So, now I wanna talk a little bit about like where have you heard of hoarding disorder, if you have, like where did you get this information if you have?
Participant:
Oh, every once in a while I watch hoarders.
Interviewer: Okay, so television. But anywhere else in your life have you heard about it or read about it or seen it?
