Interviewer:
Okay. How do you know when you have too many possessions or items?
Participant 013:
I guess when they can't just be organized easily. My closet is too full and I know I have too many clothes. So I have been reading through them. Things that have a stain or a rip or not, or they're just not whatever, I'll put in the bag and then next time we're passing a clothes bin. 
That's the thing here, we don't have a lot of Goodwills and Salvation Armies and stuff there. Like when we go away for the winter to Florida, they have tons of that kind of stuff and it's very easy. But I have been selling, actually I've been selling clothes on this website called Poshmark, which is a newer website.
Interviewer:
Oh, yeah, I know of Poshmark.
Participant 013:
Yeah, it's great. It's really focused on clothes and that kind of stuff. So been selling a lot of clothes on there, which has been great. I think when I get to the point where my closet's overflowing and I can't find anything, or my bookshelves are too full, and I have to start weeding out. 
I mean my mother always used to say that when I was a kid, a teenager, I'd be like, "If I only had a bigger room, it wouldn't be so messy." Then she'd put me in the bigger room in the house and then it would still be messy. Then I'd say, "If I only had a smaller room, then I'd have to be more organized." Then she'd move me back to the smaller room and it would be messy. So I don't know.
Interviewer:
Okay. This is kind of a little bit different, but what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Participant 013:
Well, I think you can be perfectly normal collector, if you collect certain things. As long as you have a place for them and they are significant in some way, they have a usefulness or they just make you happy. 
But I think it becomes hoarding when it gets to be so much that you can't keep it organized, it takes up too much room in your life and your house. I think if you're literally keeping things that are just, like we were saying, trash and doesn't have a function, I guess there's a line obviously between normal collecting and hoarding, for sure.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 013:
I think I'm somewhere in the middle.
