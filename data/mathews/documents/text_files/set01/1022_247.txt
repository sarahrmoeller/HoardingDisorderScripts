Interviewee:
There was a whole floor of my house I could not use because of hoarding.
Interviewer:
You made great progress now, but before that, have you ever sought to change the behavior?
Interviewee:
Oh, I always thought about it, but would never follow through.
I was just too worried about those reasons, why I bought this and I didn't finish it so I needed to keep it to finish it, or maybe someone else would need this, that type of stuff.
But up until, like I said, two months ago when we became quarantined and I couldn't go anywhere, so I just stayed home and went through everything that I owned.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you ever thought to go to professional help for the behavior?
Interviewee:
No, mm-mm.
Interviewer:
Could you explain why not?
Interviewee:
Well, I lived overseas until about 10 years ago.
It would be a different language and that kind of stuff.
Then when I came here, I just never really had the time to do it because I was working and doing stuff, avoidance.
Interviewer:
Yeah, that makes sense.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How do your family and friends feel about your behavior?
Have you ever had conflicts with them?
Interviewee:
Well, it always would hurt my feelings when they would say, "Well, why do you have all this stuff?" Yeah, it would make me feel bad.
I have four sisters.
I come from a real large family.
I wouldn't want people to come into my house because there's all this stuff everywhere all the time.
It really made me fearful because I didn't want anyone to see how I lived.
Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Have you ever had any landlords that maybe had problems with your behavior?
Interviewee:
No, not really.
Interviewer:
No?
All right.
The next section is going to be having you talk about your space and living area.
Can you please describe the area you live in now?
Do you live alone?
What does this space look like?
Interviewee:
Describe the space I live in now since I cleaned it out last month?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
I live in a condominium?
It's two bedrooms.
Things are put away now.
Before, things were never put away.
I went through and sorted everything and gave stuff away or threw it away that was worthless and gave stuff to charity that I didn't need anymore.
Now, you can walk through every room.
There are no problems with anything, but it took two months to do that working almost every day, probably six days a week.
Interviewer:
Oh, okay.
Would you say before that you had stuff covering your counters and boxes and stuff?
How did it look?
