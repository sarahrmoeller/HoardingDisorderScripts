Interviewer:
Well, it sounds like you have a wide variety of items. So it might be hard to find enough space to give each item or each group its own place. 
Participant 34:
Right. But actually, that would be a good use of my time. If I could spend a day, perhaps talk to someone else about categorizations, like where do I keep things like binoculars and earphones and so forth, purses, keeping emergency candles and collectibles and decorative things. I have about 200 buttons from over the years, which I collected. And I have a rainbow flag with kind of the skyline of Seattle with the Space Needle in the middle. And so I hung that on my wall, and it proved to be a perfect place to pin all of the pins, buttons I've collected over the years from the '70s until present. 
So it's a combination of [inaudible 00:33:12] is good. And I have one button that says Monday, with a bar across it. No Mondays please, various candidates for office, organizations I belong to, souvenirs from bars or anniversary parties, campaigns, no on 335, yes on seven. You name it. It's lots of different things that kind of reflect my history of both involvement and also what kind of pins and what was I willing to put on my body at the time. [crosstalk 00:34:15]
Interviewer:
And it sounds, so it sounds like you- 
Participant 34:
Political as well. 
Interviewer:
I live the items that you're keeping. It seems like they have a lot of value to you, both for remembering but also remembering why you do those things in the first place or reminding you of what you believe in. 
Participant 34:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
So how do you decide if your behavior of collecting or of saving items is a problem?
Participant 34:
Well, part of it is deciding when you're looking at say, something like moving, where you really want to try to minimizing the stuff you have to move. Some of it is knowing why you value certain things and why you keep them. 
And some of it is well, just things get old and break. So that's fine. Or you get inspired and you clean up a room or clear out that closet and make it look like new. It's well organizing. It's a matter of spending the hour of whatever it takes to do that. And I think a lot of time, some are sitting at the computer, watching television and Bs'ing with people. And you know, we're all staying home because of the virus. It's hard to find that 15 to 60 minutes it's going to take to clear out that closet or reorganize those drawers, check the expiration dates on food in your refrigerator. 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). It just takes a little bit of time that we often don't think we have.
