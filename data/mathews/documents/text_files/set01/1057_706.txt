Interviewee:
Yeah, I mean I think I would, it would be good to have, you know after having this conversation or whatever it definitely would be good to have maybe a time of the year or a couple times of the year where you go through your stuff, especially like clothes and, and shoes and things like that and kind of make that decision, you know, have I used this thing, if not, then, you know, it, it would probably be good to get rid of those things and so, maybe just having like a system in place where you kind of go through things or even renew things that have maybe worn out or you know lost their shine or whatever. I think, you know, getting rid of the old and bringing something in new might even provide some new energy in my life overall, so.
Interviewer:
If you had to change anything now, I know you mentioned earlier that if someone made you get rid of things you would not be bothered, but if you had to change anything about your behavior now regarding clutter or keeping things, would it upset you at all, aside from, I, you mentioned the like personal sentimental items. Like say, you said you have maybe some backpacks you don’t use. If your wife had you throw all of those away tomorrow would that be upsetting to you?
Interviewee:
Yeah, okay, yeah. I mean if you, if you, if I had to throw all of them away tomorrow I would probably be a little perturbed.
