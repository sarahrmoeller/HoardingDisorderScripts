Interviewer:
Okay. So, how would you say Covid-19 has affected your motivation to maybe seek help for hoarding?
Participant 009:
Well, like I said, I feel like I'm in limbo.
There's not too much I feel like I can do about this right now.
Interviewer:
Okay.
But maybe not even like professional help?
Participant 009:
Well, I had never really considered getting professional help for this.
I've thought about, I mean, several years ago I went through a program that's called A Solution, and it was a... I went to it for weight loss but people go for all kinds of reasons, including hoarding, and I thought about contacting them and seeing if they have remote coaching, things like that.
I know they do, but get signed up for something like that again, and they do have online resources.
So, that's the kind of help that I've considered starting up.
Excuse me.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, that's sounded interesting.
You said it's like coaching and organizers or is it like doctors?
Participant 009:
No. It's a program, they changed the name of it and it's called EBT now.
It used to be called The Solution, and it was a program for any kind of excessive behavior, over eating, over working, over game playing, hoarding, any kind of excessive behavior.
And the point of the program was to get to what the underlying reasons were for why you did this and deal with those, you know, what are the root causes.
So, it was a long program, I did it for four years where you have weekly meetings, and then in between the meetings you have workbooks that you're doing and you're calling and speaking with three other participants during the week to go through this process and figuring out what your emotions are of why you're being triggered by different things.
It's like, "Oh, last night I started stuffing my face.
What was going on with me?" So, deep diving into your past over and over again, so with the workbooks would start you'd do like the first 10 years of your life, the 2nd 10 years, and you would go back and repeat that with each workbook going deeper.
So, it was really interesting, I lost weight but never dieted, and when I finished the program I felt a lot happier and more settled in myself, so.
Interviewer:
That's very interesting.
I've never heard of it before.
Participant 009:
Oh. It's run by this women NAME, and she's in the San Francisco Bay area, and she started off working with children who were overweight and then developed this program.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well, I'm trying to see if there's any other questions.
I think we actually covered everything.
Let me just pause the recording.
