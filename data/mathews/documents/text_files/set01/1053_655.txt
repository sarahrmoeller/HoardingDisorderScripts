Interviewer:
Okay so organization and just being able to find things, that's more of a collector, but a hoarder has less organization and it's more disordered, of course.
Interviewee:
Yeah, and I suppose the value of the object itself.
You know how easily you could replace it or get the information, like thinking of the brothers in New York that had all those newspapers in their house.
You know, if you needed to find a newspaper article you could get it from the library or something.
You don't need to keep all these decades worth of newspapers in your apartment.
So, you know...
Interviewer:
Okay, and what does hoarding disorder look like?
Interviewee:
It looks like a house that you can't walk from one room to the next.
And it looks like bottle caps and aluminum foil and insect and rodent infestations and objects that have no intrinsic value to 99% of the population.
If someone keeps that kind of stuff, then I think they’re disordered.
Interviewer:
Okay, and based on your description, how is that the same or different from your own behavior?
Interviewee:
I keep a lot of stuff, that I have no use for, but I think at some point I might want to look at it.
I might want that association or, more importantly, I think sometimes there's stuff mixed in with... like a letter that might trigger me might be mixed in with a bunch of old bills or third class mail or something like that, that I just don't want to touch it or look at it, to sort through it because I think it would be triggering or upsetting to me.
So I'll just keep the whole thing instead, the whole mess and stick it in a drawer or plastic bag and then put the plastic bag in the closet and then take it out of the closet, put it in a box, and put it in the attic or something like that.
Interviewer:
Okay, so for you, your problems with clutter is it's less like obstructive in your house, but you definitely put things away, but it’s less organized.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, and do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without being in their home?
Interviewee:
Well, I guess it would be if someone was  [INCOHERENT] and then they told you, but no. I don’t know.
Interviewer:
So you don’t think so?
Interviewee:
Probably not.
Interviewer:
Okay and where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Where have you heard of it?
