Participant:
Well again, I’m on the slow road to decumulating rather than accumulating. I’m trying not to gather stuff that I don’t need at this point in time. And I am, um, I, I, expect that through garage sales and charitable donations and Craigslist and things that I think might help more of financial value. I am in the process of slowly getting rid of stuff, although it’s not nearly fast enough for the significant other.
Interviewer: Right. Okay so, theoretically, if you woke up tomorrow and all of your things had suddenly vanished, I mean you still had all the things you needed to get by, but perhaps your significant other would say are unnecessary are suddenly gone, how would you feel about that?
Participant:
I would be sad, but I would carry on.
Interviewer: Right, okay so it wouldn’t impact you too drastically.
Participant:
I would be very sad, but then I would carry on.
Interviewer: Okay, understandable. Okay so, the last little bit here—
Participant:
I mean, people’s houses burn down. What do you do? You lose everything, you start over. So, I’d need a bigger house and I’d accumulate more stuff!
Interviewer: LAUGHING Right. So, the last little bit here is just some demographic questions. Again, I wanna remind you, you don’t have to answer them if you don’t want to, but it definitely would help in gathering data for this study. So, the first question for you is what’s your highest level of education?
Participant:
A professional degree.
Interviewer: Okay, so, a bachelor’s degree?
Participant:
Beyond that.
Interviewer: Beyond that? Okay.
Participant:
A doctoral degree.
Interviewer: Okay, awesome. So, I’m gonna list a few ranges for household incomes and if you can, just pick one that applies to your household. Okay, so it goes less than $10,000, $10,000 to $20,000, $20,000 to $35,000, $35,000 to $50,000, $50,000 to $100,000, $100,000 to $150,000, or more than $150,000?
Participant:
I would say for current household income, you can stick it in the fifty to one hundred range.
Interviewer: Okay. So, in the US, which geographic region do you live in?
Participant:
That would be the Southeast.
Interviewer: Okay. And, what was your sex assigned at birth?
Participant:
They made me a male.
Interviewer: Okay. And, what gender do you identify as now?
Participant:
I’m still a male.
Interviewer: Okay, perfect. And, what do you identify as racially?
Participant:
I’m [inaudible; ] Caucasian and I would be still Caucasian.
Interviewer: Okay. So, you wouldn’t describe yourself as Hispanic or Latino?
Participant:
I am not Hispanic.
Interviewer: Okay. So, that about wraps up all my questions. And, the last thing I wanna mention to you is you are entitled to a thirty-dollar Amazon gift card for doing this interview. And um, would you prefer that be electronic or a physical gift card mailed to you?
Participant:
If you could email that to me, to the email that you presumably have on record, that would be fine.
Interviewer: Okay, so, I’ll jot that down. And, that should come within, um, you know a couple weeks or a couple days. But again, there may be some delays because of COIVD-19.
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer: So, if you have any more questions for me, uh, feel free to ask. But other than that, those are all I have for you.
Participant:
Okie dokie.
Interviewer: Okay, well thank you so much and I hope you have a great day.
Participant:
You too. Thank you.
Interviewer: Mhmm, bye now.
Participant:
Buh-bye.
