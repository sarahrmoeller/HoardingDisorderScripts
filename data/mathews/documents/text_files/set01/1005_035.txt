Interviewee:
Saving more ... No, it's okay. Saving more ... I would imagine one big difference is that normal saving will never or almost never save more than you could ever possibly need whereas someone with hoarding attributes is just saving everything no matter what. Every single out-of-shape container forever as opposed to maybe one in two you might be able to reuse again some day. That's probably what I would think is the biggest.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Interviewee:
I would imagine their car might look similar. I don't know. I would imagine that you might recognize it in some people but not on everyone.
Interviewer:
Yeah. That makes sense. Also, what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder? Where did you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
I think I'm using that phrase generically as opposed to in a critical sense. I'm an attorney and I've been involved in some matters where one of the litigants was, in fact, a hoarder and so I have been inside of homes where it was a true... you know the bathroom had 15 blenders that she bought on sale or the 15 used styrofoam containers from takeout that were kind of clean. That's kind of what comes to mind. When I think of maybe hoarding disorder, that's where my mind goes.
Interviewer:
When you did view these homes for your work, did it have any affect on your personal behavior or anything?
Interviewee:
At the time, I don't think it did because I don't think I recognized my clutter issues as being a subset of that same issue. That's been fairly recent. No. I think it perhaps even maybe made it easier for me to separate from that because this is a person that goes out and buys six blenders. It's an extreme. You have little pathways through a house filled with newspapers from the ground to the ceiling. That was so extreme that it was easy to kind of characterize that in that way and not put myself into that category.
Interviewer:
Yeah. That makes sense. This is actually the end of this section of the Interviewer. Thank you again. Next I will read some scenarios and then ask you some questions after each one. Does that sound good?
Interviewee:
Okay. Yup.
