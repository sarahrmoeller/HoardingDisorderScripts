Interviewer:
I imagine that must have been difficult.
If you had to choose between certain items, like say in that case, when he wanted you to de-clutter.
How would you decide...
Or the vases, when you mentioned having a lot.
How would you decide which one you would keep?
Participant 46:
Well at that time I couldn't decide, mind was shut down, there was nothing going.
And in fact too, there's lots of...
My stepmother passed away and she said some awful things in her will.
Then for 10 years I haven't moved a thing.
So from 2010 until this last year when I fell, and probably let go of some of my stepmother's thoughts, I hadn't done anything.
I just let it pile up and pile up and pile up, where it was getting to the point where I had no room.
So I just decided after the fall last year that I needed room, and that I just needed to let go of some of my thoughts, and then it became a little bit easier to let of some of the stuff.
Interviewer:
Detaching from your thoughts was helpful?
Participant 46:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 46:
Yes, and after that argument with my ex, I didn't let anything go.
In fact, we probably broke up, I kept my stuff and I started hoarding more to where the point is, like I said.
There was no kitchen space, there was no stair space, there was nothing.
Everything was piled 10 feet high with papers and clothes, and it was just tough.
Interviewer:
You mentioned that you fell.
Did the clutter contribute to your fall recently?
Participant 46:
No, no, no. I fell at work.
Interviewer:
You fell at work?
Participant 46:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So the space, can you please describe the space that you live in now, and what it's like?
Participant 46:
The space I live in now?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Are you still in the same place you mentioned earlier, with the upstairs and the downstairs?
Participant 46:
Yes, I've been there 20 years, right?
Remember, this is the house I bought bigger to replace the smaller house so I could store more stuff, right?
So-
Interviewer:
How much bigger is this house?
Participant 46:
Well, it is a lot bigger.
I used to live in a two bedroom, one bathroom little tiny house, and now I live in a four bedroom, three bathroom, upstairs, downstairs, basement.
Huge yard.
And it did get quite full, I'm telling you.
But again, since the fall things have had to change.
Interviewer:
Are you living there alone still?
Participant 46:
Yeah, now I am, although I'm still friendly with my ex.
He's coming over...
Well here's something.
My pruning shears broke, and I'm deciding to throw away, they're broken, and I'm deciding to throw them away.
Now I have no personal attachment to them, and I'm hoping I'm able to throw them away, but they're sitting on the counter near the garbage.
But they haven't been thrown away, and he's bringing me another pair, so we'll see what I do with those pruning shears, the broken ones.
Interviewer:
Are there any rooms in your home that you aren't able to use because they're full of clutter?
