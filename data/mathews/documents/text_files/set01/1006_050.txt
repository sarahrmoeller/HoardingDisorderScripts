Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. I can go on to the next scenario if you're ready.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered, and it is difficult for him to walk in his house. Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.
Interviewee:
Wow.
Interviewer:
Do you think that this person could have hoarding disorder? Or clutter problems?
Interviewee:
Could be both.
Interviewer:
Okay, you think so? Do you think that they should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee:
Yes, for the sake of work if nothing else.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah, that was a good answer. Do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
Yeah. It sounds like me. If he can't get hold of it himself, yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Do you think this behavior's similar or different to your own?
Interviewee:
Well, similar in that he keeps things he thinks he might use in the future. I never had to spend a lot of things I knew that I'd have to have for the next day, and I was never late for work or anything like that. That part of it is not like me. But the keeping the boxes in case you might need them, that sounds perfectly like me.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. Okay. The next one is, John Doe has craft items that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. Craft items occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is usually late in getting where he needs to be. Okay. Do you think that the person I read about here could have hoarding?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you think that they should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Why or why not?
Interviewee:
I think he probably is stressed from not being able to find what he needs to get through each day.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
