Interviewee47:
Well, because I was a collector with coins, I know how valuable a coin is or a bill is based on how old it is, what condition it's in.
So I have books that tell me how much they're really worth.
Interviewer:
So monetary value then.
Interviewee47:
Yeah, monetary value.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee47:
I have clothes that are like retro clothes.
I did do the whole one of those clean books say take all your clothes and throw them in the middle and then sort them out.
I did do that, but I did keep some clothes that were retro, and I was actually an extra in a movie and they said, "Where did you get those retro clothes?" I'm like, "In my closet."
Interviewer:
Wow, that's so cool.
Interviewee47:
So was makes it valuable is the sentimental value, that monetary value.
Interviewer:
Of course.
Interviewee47:
Just kind of the emotional value.
I still have a couple dolls.
I remember my godmother that gave it to me.
She hardly had any money herself and she gave it to me, a doll my mom wouldn't let me touch because she only had one doll in her life, and her brothers tore it apart.
Here this was the doll that she ...
She kept telling me, "When you get a place of your own, I'll send it to you," but she never did because she actually wanted it herself.
Interviewer:
It was sentimental to her.
Interviewee47:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee47:
Then photographs too.
I have a hard time with photographs.
Interviewer:
Photographs, okay.
So now what do you consider to be trash?
What are the kind of times that you discard, other than the papers that you've said?
Interviewee47:
Oh. Well, things that are ... if they've got stuff on them, like food on them, or if they have any type of mail.
As soon as the mail comes in, I automatically get rid of anything that isn't a bill and just advertisement.
That's trash.
I'm realizing now I need to ... we already talked about anything that's really old.
Just trash, trash.
Interviewer:
Okay, so just normal trash that you don't want.
Interviewee47:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So what do you consider the most precious item in your house, if you can choose one?
Interviewee47:
I'd say photographs.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So why do you consider photographs to be the most valuable thing you own?
Interviewee47:
Well, before we got smartphones, that was our way of kind of taking a moment and keeping it.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee47:
I have pictures of my parents and my sister that I cannot retake.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee47:
They're moments frozen in history and they're precious because you remember back to that time.
Interviewer:
Of course, yeah.
Interviewee47:
So I guess those are-
Interviewer:
It's like the memories that you were talking about.
The memory of it you don't want to part with.
