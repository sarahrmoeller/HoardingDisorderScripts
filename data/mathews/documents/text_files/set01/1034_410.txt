Interviewer:
How do you determine what is then worth keeping versus throwing away for you?
How do you determine what you're going to throw away or donate?
Participant 34:
Well, just my own judgment, I guess.
Does it have lasting value?
Is it a contract that's expired, a lease that's no longer applicable because I don't live there anymore?
But I carried a hard copy of the lease.
Also, one issue is, do I have a reliable electronic copy and access to that copy of important documents or can I create images, make electronic copies and keep them in the computer and toss the paper?
That's what I did professionally in the superior court here, was to get the records from paper into computers.
So instead of looking for a file, which would be an object of documents bound together that relate to a case that somebody's got in their possession, the judge, the defense attorney, the prosecuting attorney, someone who checked it out to look up something.
We created a system where everyone could access the documents electronically because we scanned paper into images and then started electronic filing.
So documents would never exist in paper form.
Interviewer:
That's an awesome thing to do.
Participant 34:
Yes.
And we got an award from Kennedy School of Government for innovation in American government.
Interviewer:
Sounds like it was well deserved.
Participant 34:
Yes, it was.
No, it took about 20 years.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like you're a very practical person and that you keep items that have value to you, but you're also looking for ways to maybe trim down, keeping paper copies of records or, like you don't keep every note sent to you.
Participant 34:
INAUDIBLE
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So what items or if you have a specific item, is most valuable to you?
And why is it valuable?
Participant 34:
What items are most valuable?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 34:
I have an oil painting that a friend, who's since died, made that needs to go to a museum eventually.
That's something that I would grab, say if there were a fire.
There's a piece of art that shows two bears, one older and one younger lying in bed.
And it says, "Ask Dad.
He knows."
And that was done by a friend who's also, who has passed away.
And so I use that as my Facebook logo and other things.
Interviewer:
He was really cool.
Participant 34:
And so I'd want to grab that, my autograph by Divine, which I got on my 36th birthday.
Just items like that come to mind.
I guess the computer.
Hopefully, that's all backed up into the cloud.
Interviewer:
Yes.
So no need for the physical actual existence of it.
Participant 34:
Yes.
