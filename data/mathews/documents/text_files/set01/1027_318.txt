Interviewer:
Right.
It can be hard to determine how you're going to feel before a situation occurs.
Participant 27:
Right, but I do think about that.
We're in a flood zone in Florida, and we're in a hurricane spot.
So all the pictures that are down there and all things that are down there, there's duplicates up here.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 27:
The other thing is we don't carry insurance like house insurance.
If something happens to this house, I have the land, but we have the other house in Florida.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Having that extra house is kind of an actual security blanket.
Participant 27:
Yeah.
I guess I kind of... I know that I live my life with backups and with being prepared and that's one thing of course the Coast Guard teaches.
INAUDIBLE is Semper Paratus, so I'm always prepared.
That is why I buy duplicates of items that I know I'm going to want or I'm going to use for probably the rest of my life.
It was probably about 30 years ago, I found these plastic baskets with a handle and I bought all they had, which was 12.
I have only given one of those away and it took a lot for me to give that one away, and didn't she go throw it in a trash.
Those plastic baskets have stood up all these years for going to the beach, for wherever.
Buying multiples of something that is on...
They were on clearance, so buying multiples of something that is on clearance makes me feel like I'm as prepared as I could be for whatever might happen.
Interviewer:
Okay, gotcha.
How do you decide when you think you have...
Or how do you decide when you have too much?
Participant 27:
No, wait a minute.
When I can't fit any more clothes in my drawers or... I also bought these tall Rubbermaid things that have handles that are very handy for storing sweatshirts and sweaters and stuff like that.
I pretty much ran out of space with clothes and so I can take bags of clothes to Goodwill.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So running out of space in places like drawers if you have too many clothes.
Participant 27:
Yeah, and then the other thing was that I didn't fit into those clothes anymore.
I still have clothes that I wore when I was in seventh grade and I'm now 74.
I could still wear those clothes as of probably maybe 10 years ago.
Since then I have put on a little weight.
I am 97 pounds, so I'm not...
But I used to be 84 pounds.
If I absolutely cannot get into them and I weigh 97 pounds or if they're itchy or I don't like them, then I can take them to Goodwill.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That makes sense.
What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
