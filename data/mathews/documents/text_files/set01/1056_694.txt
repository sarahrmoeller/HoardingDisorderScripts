Participant:
Um… that would be… if there was anything that didn’t go to the right home, but there isn’t anything that I would be launched into a terrible depression if it disappeared.
Interviewer (23:06): Right. So, it kinda sounds like to you, it’s more important that the thing be put to good use or that it ends up in the right home, like you said, rather than just, you know, having it around for no reason. So, parting with things isn’t really a problem as long as they end up somewhere where they belong?
Participant:
Somewhere where they are um, appreciated, yes.
Interviewer (23:33): Okay. Could you think of an example for me about a time where you had an idea of something, where it should go, and if it did end up there or if it didn’t.
Participant:
Um… I probably had some old pet supplies, you know like, uh, uh, uh, and aquarium and things like that, that um, found its way to um, I believe in that particular case, someone that was wanting to start a terrarium. So hey, okay, then I’m down one aquarium. That’s fine, cause it’s, it’s going to a family member that wanted to start a terrarium. One last piece of stuff accumulated in the house.
Interviewer (24:21): Okay. So um, do you enjoy getting rid of the things in your collections? Like does it give you—
Participant:
If they go to a good use, yes!
Interviewer (24:30): Okay. So, ideally you would like to have less stuff?
Participant:
I would be quite content to have much less stuff if the stuff was well used.
Interviewer (24:39): Okay. So, in your opinion do you think that you have too much stuff, and if you do, how would you know that you have too much stuff?
Participant:
I have too much stuff. I know that I have too much stuff because I keep getting told this is stuff that I need to push out of the way and get somewhere else than the house. Um… my volume of stuff has exceeded the ability for it to all live on shelves in neat order. So, there are piles and boxes on floors that would um, uh, be an indicator perhaps that there’s more stuff than I have space for.
Interviewer (25:29): Right. So, really it comes mostly from other people telling you that you have too much stuff and also, you know that the perception that it can’t all fit on like a shelf or look, you know, particularly organized? 
Participant:
That would be fair.
Interviewer (25:48): Okay. So, if you have to choose between your items, I know we talked a lot on assigning things values if someone could potentially use them or if they’re sellable, but if you were debating between keeping a couple items, how would you know which one to choose?
