Interviewee:
The coat rack.
They are hung up on the coat rack.
There is another closet where the entryway is also jammed with lots of coats.
Interviewer: Okay, and what kinds of things are hoarded in the house?
Interviewee:
Next to the end of the closet is a section that contains 30 or 40 years of collected audio.
In spite of getting rid of some crates of vinyl, there are several crates of vinyl.
There are some cassettes, several hundred CDs, and audio reproduction here in this other cabinet.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
And, is there like any level of organization with things that are hoarded, or is it generally just cluttered?
Interviewee:
It’s like a jumble, yeah.
Mostly a clutter.
Interviewer: Okay, and are there any areas in the house that you can no longer use because of the clutter?
Interviewee:
Yes, the basement is largely dedicated to [wife’s name; ]’s collection of recipes, and particles, and yarn for use someday.
Interviewer: Right.
Okay, so, there’s lots of papers and, just like, odds-and-ends and things.
Okay, how about any appliances that you may not be able to use?
Interviewee:
Let’s see.
We did get the freezer out.
That was a big accomplishment.
Nearly 10 years nonfunctioning.
The freezer was finally this spring removed from the basement, and we delivered it to the curb.
Interviewer: Okay.
Anything else on the home?
Interviewee:
Up until the COVID, we were getting rid of boxes of used clothing, but during COVID we’ve, um, the Goodwill is unable to receive drop-offs.
Interviewer: Right.
Okay, so, when you were getting rid of those items, was it causing you or your wife any distress?
Interviewee:
A form of it, but kind of just bearing down and experiencing discomfort anyway and getting it done.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, yes it did cause distress, but you were unable to overcome it to get rid of that stuff?
Interviewee:
Some of it, yes.
Interviewer: Right.
Okay, what were the things that you weren’t able to get rid of?
Interviewee:
We still have um… scores of lineal feet of books, um, scores of lineal space for clothing, and um… we’ve got over 30 years of magazine that we’ve saved but not referred back to.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
Okay, so, in your home are there any rooms that are generally non-cluttered?
Interviewee:
Hmm… the kitchen would be least cluttered.
Interviewer: Okay.
And what does your kitchen look like?
Interviewee:
A [INAUDIBLE]-top island in the center, fridge and microwave, one wall with cabinets and the pantry.
Interviewer: And things are neatly organized in the pantry, and in the cupboards, and in everything?
