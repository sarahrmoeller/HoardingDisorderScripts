Interviewer:
And those people, would you say that they have clutter problems or hoarding disorder?
Participant 018:
No. However, one of them had mentioned that he would like to buy something really expensive because he would just like to have it.
Interviewer:
So, you see parallels?
Participant 018:
So, for him it's the...
So, the thing of having could be part of hoarding.
Interviewer:
Right, right, right.
That makes total sense.
So, even though these individuals in these antique collector groups are organized, and that makes it different than hoarding disorder, that impulse to just have something in order to have it, that's very much the same.
So, you can see that there's similarities.
Participant 018:
Yeah.
That could be like hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That makes sense.
So, it sounds like there's really a spectrum in your mind.
It's not cut or dry.
It's some people have a little bit of hoarding.
Participant 018:
Right, whereas my sister is everything cut or dry, black or white, one extreme or the other, but to me, when you go from one extreme to the other, it's different sides of the same coin.
Interviewer:
That makes total sense.
Sure.
So, it's not as simple as just saying, "I'm going to keep things," or, "I'm going to throw them all out."
You might keep some things.
Participant 018:
Right.
You either have to have everything or you have nothing, but I think there has to be a balance.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
When you hear the term hoarding disorder, what do you think about?
Participant 018:
Well, the impulse to have more stuff than you need.
Interviewer:
Have you ever heard about hoarding anywhere, being talked about or being discussed?
What do people tend to say about it, and what's your knowledge of it?
Participant 018:
Well, now people have this idea that it's totally wrong because they've seen these hoarding shows where things are way too out of hand.
Interviewer:
So, people have this very extreme view?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
So, now people have...
Yeah.
They have the view that it's too extreme.
Interviewer:
Do you think of it as something that...
If you were to give somebody advice on how to deal with hoarding problems, what advice would you give them?
Participant 018:
Well, I guess I don't really advise people because that would...
There's one person I know who was paying a lot for storage, several storage units that would just accumulate more and more things, so I didn't really know what to say.
Interviewer:
What do you think would help you deal with all of your stuff?
I mean, is it a problem of space?
Is it a problem of time?
Do you think that you would benefit from somebody to help you organize, or do you think that you would benefit from seeing someone like a doctor who could help you to deal with the anxiety component?
What do you think would help you?
Participant 018:
I'm always needing to know where I can take some things.
I don't know.
