That's the biggest activity it gets in the way of.
Because you can sit and read anywhere, and it's pretty easy to sit and work on the computer or iPad or whatever you have at the moment.
And so I think that's one reason I just close off up in the bedroom.
So ...
Interviewer:
Has it ever impacted your work?
Participant 49:
It's frustrating.
I'm sorry?
Interviewer:
Has it ever impacted your work?
Participant 49:
I missed that.
Interviewer:
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay.
Has it ever impacted your work life?
Participant 49:
Yeah, it would ... I was the head of a computer department before I was the head of the math department, and kids would kid me about it, because when you teach programming in a High school, even a pretty big high school, you're the only one.
So you have these same kids for four years, so they know you pretty well.
And they would kid that they were going to bring a ...
Oh, what do you call it?
It's like a flame shooter, and get rid of the piles for me and stuff, because they knew I would laugh about it with them.
So, it would get in the way of things, but I always did my job just fine, so it would just be ... I couldn't have a nice, neat, cleaner desk like so many people can manage.
Interviewer:
So, when your students teased you about it, did that really upset you?
Participant 49:
No, I was laughing with them.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 49:
Because I liked my students.
You know what I mean?
And they were kidding me.
They were not being mean.
You can tell, pretty much.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you mentioned earlier, when we were talking, you said that your friends are very supportive.
Have they ever gotten upset with you over not being able to come over, or anything like that?
Participant 49:
No, they're more ... any kind of upset, which isn't the right word, but any kind of reaction like that is more of a, "I wish for you, you could do such and such" kind of reaction.
A very supportive, sympathetic reaction.
And again, one of my friends is so amazingly organized, I cannot imagine how she does it, and she has always offered to come over and help if I wanted to.
And other friends have offered, if there was anything they could do.
So, they're not ... I don't even think they've been judgmental.
Or if they have been, which I'm sure we're all judgmental to an extent, but not to me, they haven't been.
They might be judgmental, but not in interacting with me.
So, I'm very lucky that way.
Interviewer:
Yeah, they sound very supportive.
Participant 49:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So this last question is kind of going to wrap it all up, but would you be really upset if someone just came and got rid of some of your items?
