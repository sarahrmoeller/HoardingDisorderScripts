Participant 043:
Yes. There's a lot of ... I got groceries and I haven't put everything away yet because I can't reach all of the shelves and also that's where I put papers that I'm going to need like whenever we have a restaurant we get a $200 voucher that we can use every month but you can't roll it over to use in the restaurant and since the restaurant is closed, we now get delivered meals if we sign up for it.
I keep all my vouchers and stuff on there because sometimes they screw up and you get to take out more than what they should have, they get somebody else's name ...
Somebody else gets something using your name, so I have stuff like that.
When I get papers, bills I need to pay and stuff, I lay that there so that it's easily accessed.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay.
What about any bathtubs or stoves?
Are those being used for storage?
Participant 043:
Yes.
I've got things on top of my stove but I don't use my stove.
I don't really use the microwave and that's raised up so that's okay.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Thinking about the items in your home, how important are your things for you to feel at home and of those items, what are the most important to you?
I know you've mentioned a lot about these papers and documents that you're holding onto and you're hoping to file them at some point and then the vouchers but are there other things that you find that might be the most important to you?
Participant 043:
Yes.
Stuff related to my parents, especially my mother.
Both of them are deceased now and my mother had Alzheimer's and I would go see her almost every day and my siblings didn't go see her.
I would give her gifts and stuff and stuff like that, I ended up taking home with me the night she died.
Like a bear that I had given her and a dog and a ceramic dog from Bradford Exchange and pictures, videos I had made of her before and I would show her when I would be visiting and stuff.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
I'm really sorry to hear that.
You would say the items related to your mom and your father are probably the most important to you.
Do you feel that you spend a lot of time with these items?
Participant 043:
I don't necessarily look at them every day but right now my bear, INAUDIBLE and I have that sitting in my window and then I have a spotlight that I turn on at night because in the town I live in they have what's called their Teddy Bear Hunt and it's people going out with their small kids and looking in windows to find teddy bears.
Interviewer:
Yes.
I've seen that.
That's so cute.
