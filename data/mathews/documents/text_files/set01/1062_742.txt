Participant:
Well, photographs first of all; family photographs. The art in files and things that I’ve done all through the years like the stuff on my computer. And my phone! And then stuff that you can’t really replace like stuff you’ve been given or that kind of stuff, or stuff you’ve collected that is hard to replace, certain T shirts or something like that.

Okay, so now this section of questions is about how you value your possessions. So I know that you mentioned that your pictures and your files are what you hold most dear, but when you think about all of your possessions, what makes them valuable to you? 
Participant:
Mostly either the things that you can’t replace or… oh yeah the files are included because that’s all years and years and years of work which is like artwork or things that I value. Yeah, so the most difficult ones are, you know, your photos which are family things, which you can’t just buy; you can’t replace them.
