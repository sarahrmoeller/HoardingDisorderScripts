Interviewee:
It's different. He has the space to [INAUDIBLE] whereas stuff is kind of [INAUDIBLE], some of it [INAUDIBLE] these extra clothes or-
Interviewer:
Okay. The next vignette is John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the items came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.
Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. So do you think this person has hoarding disorder, or his behavior is more like clutter problems?
Interviewee:
That sounds more like hoarding disorder.
Interviewer:
Why do you think this?
Interviewee:
Just because the fact that it's having [INAUDIBLE] he can't find stuff [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
So do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
Probably, yeah. [INAUDIBLE] if it's not [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay. And how is this behavior similar or different to your own?
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE] definitely not, [INAUDIBLE] floor space to walk around, [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay. All right. The next one is, John Doe has food that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. Food occupies most of his rooms, except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he's usually late in getting where he needs to be.
So again, do you think this behavior is more like hoarding disorder or more like clutter problems and why?
Interviewee:
It sounds like hoarding. [INAUDIBLE] hoarding disorder.
Interviewer:
Okay. So do you think this person requires treatment for his behavior from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
Very likely.
Interviewer:
Then is this behavior similar or different to your own, and why?
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE] it's probably similar [INAUDIBLE].
