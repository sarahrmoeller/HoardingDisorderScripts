Participant  004:
It's different. He has the space to [inaudible 00:18:07] whereas stuff is kind of [inaudible 00:18:22], some of it [inaudible 00:18:29] these extra clothes or-
Interviewer:
Okay. The next vignette is John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the items came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.
Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. So do you think this person has hoarding disorder, or his behavior is more like clutter problems?
Participant  004:
That sounds more like hoarding disorder.
Interviewer:
Why do you think this?
Participant  004:
Just because the fact that it's having [inaudible 00:19:35] he can't find stuff [inaudible 00:19:44].
Interviewer:
So do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant  004:
Probably, yeah. [inaudible 00:20:03] if it's not [inaudible 00:20:08].
Interviewer:
Okay. And how is this behavior similar or different to your own?
Participant  004:
[inaudible 00:20:13] definitely not, [inaudible 00:20:19] floor space to walk around, [inaudible 00:20:22].
Interviewer:
Okay. All right. The next one is, John Doe has food that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. Food occupies most of his rooms, except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he's usually late in getting where he needs to be.
So again, do you think this behavior is more like hoarding disorder or more like clutter problems and why?
Participant  004:
It sounds like hoarding. [inaudible 00:21:01] hoarding disorder.
Interviewer:
Okay. So do you think this person requires treatment for his behavior from a psychiatrist?
Participant  004:
Very likely.
Interviewer:
Then is this behavior similar or different to your own, and why?
Participant  004:
[inaudible 00:21:37] it's probably similar [inaudible 00:21:43].
