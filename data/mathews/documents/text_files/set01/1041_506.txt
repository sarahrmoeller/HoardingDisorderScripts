Interviewee:
Not all the time.
I mean, I figured that he was a little eccentric, and eccentric isn't a bad thing because I'm eccentric in some ways, like you're eclectic, but no. There's really no way, unless they have a smell, but some people have cooking smells related to their house.
You really can't tell.
You may have an inkling, but I would say if they're really bad, if they just have an unkempt appearance, like I'm talking about a hoarder.
Maybe they have an unkempt appearance.
They might have a smell, different things like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So-
Interviewee:
But, yeah.
Go ahead.
Interviewer:
Okay, sorry.
So you said that you watch the show Hoarders.
Where else do you get information about hoarding disorder, or where have you heard of it?
Interviewee:
I think I read up a little bit on it a long time ago, but that was pretty much it.
Just reading a couple of things.
I know I have cluttering issues, so I looked it up a couple times just online.
I don't remember the exact sites, but that's pretty much what I looked it up on, and even more recent because I'm like, "Okay, this is getting a bit out of control."
My mom brought it to my attention too and I was like, "Okay, this is not good.
It's never been this.
I've always had a whole bunch of stuff, but it's never been like this before."
Yeah, it was just too much.
I had more clothes than you could imagine.
It was ridiculous, and then I worked retail and going to school.
I worked at Bath & Body Works, so every time there was a sale, I was buying $60 to $100 give or take on stuff.
Every time we'd get a paycheck, they timed it so there would be different sales, and I was like, "This is not [INAUDIBLE].
You're just giving your money back to the company that pays you."
Interviewer:
Yeah.
That's dangerous.
A sale every time?
I cannot imagine if I worked somewhere and they just had a sale every time I got my paycheck.
I'd be like, "This is not good."
Interviewee:
Mm-mmm.
Interviewer:
So how often did you watch the show Hoarders, and what did you get out of that?
