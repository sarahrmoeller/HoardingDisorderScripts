Participant 23:
That's very hard to say because for all... I mean, there are so many things that I save, I don't interact with them daily. I have various set routines and of all the things that I'm so attached, not getting rid of most items I don't use in a given day. I need to use my laptop and I like to sit on a couch and have reading material around me that I can use, that I can get to when I have time. I mean, some of the things that are important, I really do like our photo albums and memorabilia, I don't really interact with on a daily basis at all. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So you would say for the most part that you don't spend a lot of time with your things except for the necessary items, like your laptop or things you need for work?
Participant 23:
Right. Or like, I do have piles of things that I read, it's not for work, but as I said, mail or magazines that I like to read. And so I like to have those around for my spare times when I can get to those things. 
Interviewer:
Right. Okay. And when you think about your possessions, how do you determine what's valuable and what makes them valuable? 
Participant 23:
Certainly, sometimes if you spend money on something, you can think it's more valuable but a lot of times for me, it's just the sentimental value. It's the attachments is something that has an association of memory, it's related to the kids or my partner or my parents. And so I am attached to it because of the memory that it evokes and the sentimentality. And so I ended up saving a lot of things because of that. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. So you would say you may spend a lot of money on one item, but if one item maybe more sentimental or evoke certain memories, that one you might consider more valuable.
Participant 23:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. And what do you... So out out of those possessions, what do you think is the most precious item in the house for you? 
Participant 23:
Oh, that is really harsh. I have to come up with like one items?
Interviewer:
It could be a couple items. 
Participant 23:
I mean, it's kind of cheating, I do think like photo albums because they kind of evoke so many memories of different phases of life and of my children and of my partner and of my family, so that's kind of cheating in that it's not one off item but it's like  one theme. I think I would say, photo albums even though that it's not a finished project but if I had to say  one thing, I guess.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. So basically items that are, that are tied to your family?
Participant 23:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.
Interviewer:
And what would happen if you lost these items?
