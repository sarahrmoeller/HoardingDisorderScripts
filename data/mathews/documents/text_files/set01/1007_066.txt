Interviewer:
I'll read this first one. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized, but it is usually not cluttered.
Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he, eventually, finds them. When this happens, he's real late in getting to where he needs to be.
Would you say that this hoarding disorder or is it more clutter problems?
Interviewee:
He doesn't sound like a clutterer.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewee:
I can understand the urge to keep boxes. You always need boxes. People on this "Buy Nothing" group are always looking for boxes because there's people moving. No, I don't think he has a hoarding disorder at all.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I mean, he has one item that he keeps neatly in a closet. Doesn't sound like there's much ... Show me someone who has never lost anything and I will show you an infant of about three days old, because you put something down in a place you don't normally put it, I think everyone goes ... I would hope. I would imagine everyone has done that at some point or another.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Definitely not a hoarding situation, in my opinion.
Interviewer:
Okay, and then how would you say this ... Is it similar or different to your own?
Interviewee:
It's different because I don't just have one closet with my stuff in it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I have a closet that's pretty neat. I'm the exact opposite.
Interviewer:
Okay. All right, we're going to move on to the next one then. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He's worried that he might get rid of a box and he will need it later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for him to walk in his house. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and, sometimes, doesn't show up at all.
Interviewee:
Oh, that's definitely not clutter. It's hoarder.
Interviewer:
Okay.
