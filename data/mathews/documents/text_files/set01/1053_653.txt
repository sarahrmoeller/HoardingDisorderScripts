8:47 Interviewer:
Okay. And can you describe what this space is like, like if you were to tell me what it looks like, just describing as much detail as you can.
Participant:
It’s suburban, it’s 16 years old- the house is 16 years old. We had it built according to a plan that we modified. It’s 2 stories. There’s a basement. It’s part of a deed restricted neighborhood. 
9:28 Interviewer:
And are there parts of your home that you consider to be cluttered?
Participant:
Yes. 
9:35 Interviewer:
Could you describe what makes them cluttered?
Participant:
I have boxes of paper, and I have clothes piled up, and I have way too many dishes and kitchen related objects. 
10:04 Interviewer:
Okay, and are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they're intended like stuff piled in the bathtub or stuff on the stove?
Participant:
At present, no. Although that has been the case in the past.
10:23 Interviewer:
Okay, and what would you like your home to look like?
Participant:
I would like to have a place for everything and have everything in its place. And I would like to reduce the volume of possessions, maybe 20%.
10:43 Interviewer:
Okay, so organization and decreasing the amount of stuff. 
Participant:
Yeah.
10:51 Interviewer:
And how important are your items for you to feel at home? 
Participant:
I’d say important, I mean, you know, very important. 
11:09 Interviewer:
And which objects are the most important to you?
Participant:
There’s some furniture, dishes. I mean obviously appliances and, you know, things like that that make the house physically comfortable. Yeah, there’s certain pictures...
11:45 Interviewer:
Okay, so like sentimental items that you don't, you can't part with.
Participant:
Yeah. 
11:49 Interviewer:
OK, so moving on to this section about value. So when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?
Participant:
Sometimes it's associations. Sometimes its intrinsic value or maybe the beauty of something. Sometimes the association, you know, with a particular person. Sometimes it’s a memory prompt. 
12:29 Interviewer:
Right, so definitely a theme of sentimentality. And just when you see the object, you think of something or someone.
Participant:
Yeah. 
12:42 Interviewer:
Okay, so what do you discard? What is trash for you?
Participant:
Well, advertising and envelopes and you know expired coupons and stuff like that is. Once I have it in my hand, and I can see what they are, I don't have a problem with discarding them. If an object like an article of clothing is stained or damaged in some way, I don't have a problem with that.
13:25 Interviewer:
So if something has no use anymore, you know it's time to throw it away.
Participant:
Yeah. 
13:32 Interviewer:
Okay, and what is the most precious item in your house for you?
Participant:
Oh well, besides like dogs and living things... I have a dresser that’s very nice. I suppose it would be that.
