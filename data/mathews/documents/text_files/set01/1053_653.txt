Interviewer:
Okay. And can you describe what this space is like, like if you were to tell me what it looks like, just describing as much detail as you can.
Interviewee:
It’s suburban, it’s 16 years old- the house is 16 years old.
We had it built according to a plan that we modified.
It’s 2 stories.
There’s a basement.
It’s part of a deed restricted neighborhood.
Interviewer:
And are there parts of your home that you consider to be cluttered?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Could you describe what makes them cluttered?
Interviewee:
I have boxes of paper, and I have clothes piled up, and I have way too many dishes and kitchen related objects.
Interviewer:
Okay, and are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they're intended like stuff piled in the bathtub or stuff on the stove?
Interviewee:
At present, no. Although that has been the case in the past.
Interviewer:
Okay, and what would you like your home to look like?
Interviewee:
I would like to have a place for everything and have everything in its place.
And I would like to reduce the volume of possessions, maybe 20%.
Interviewer:
Okay, so organization and decreasing the amount of stuff.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
And how important are your items for you to feel at home?
Interviewee:
I’d say important, I mean, you know, very important.
Interviewer:
And which objects are the most important to you?
Interviewee:
There’s some furniture, dishes.
I mean obviously appliances and, you know, things like that that make the house physically comfortable.
Yeah, there’s certain pictures...
Interviewer:
Okay, so like sentimental items that you don't, you can't part with.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
OK, so moving on to this section about value.
So when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?
Interviewee:
Sometimes it's associations.
Sometimes its intrinsic value or maybe the beauty of something.
Sometimes the association, you know, with a particular person.
Sometimes it’s a memory prompt.
Interviewer:
Right, so definitely a theme of sentimentality.
And just when you see the object, you think of something or someone.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, so what do you discard?
What is trash for you?
Interviewee:
Well, advertising and envelopes and you know expired coupons and stuff like that is.
Once I have it in my hand, and I can see what they are, I don't have a problem with discarding them.
If an object like an article of clothing is stained or damaged in some way, I don't have a problem with that.
Interviewer:
So if something has no use anymore, you know it's time to throw it away.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, and what is the most precious item in your house for you?
Interviewee:
Oh well, besides like dogs and living things... I have a dresser that’s very nice.
I suppose it would be that.
