Participant 33:
Usually, I just run out with some sort of distraction I guess.
I mean my husband is great.
He's a great comfort to me, but I don't...
It's funny.
If there's something disturbing happens, mostly, I try to avoid thinking about it I guess for comfort.
I'll do something mindless I guess.
Interviewer:
Kind of like a distraction?
At least like a...
Participant 33:
Yeah, exactly.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you're seeing your...
You said you see your parents weekly.
Are there any other family or friends that you keep in contact with at this time?
Participant 33:
Not really.
Interviewer:
No, okay.
Participant 33:
We keep in contact with my husbands parents too, but that's somewhat less frequent, mostly they don't need us as much, but we talk to them from time to time.
Interviewer:
Do you feel socially isolated or lonely in general?
Participant 33:
I've always been kind of introverted so this doesn't really feel... I mean we've cut down on social interactions, but it doesn't really feel that bad to me I guess.
I don't really feel that isolated or lonely.
Interviewer:
Okay, did you feel that way in general prior to COVID and there's just no change or just in general, you just prefer?
Participant 33:
Yeah, I'd say there's no change.
Interviewer:
I think that's mostly it.
I'm just trying to make sure...
Any conflicts with masks or social distancing?
Participant 33:
No. Interviewer:
That's good to hear.
I think that's it on my end.
Is there anything that I didn't ask about that you think is worth mentioning?
Participant 33:
No, not that I can think of.
I think you did a pretty thorough job.
Interviewer:
Thank you.
We have a nice basic question outline that was developed that was I think fairly thorough.
Next, I'm just going to get some just basic demographic stuff.
It should be very, very quick.

If it helps, I can provide some general ranges.
