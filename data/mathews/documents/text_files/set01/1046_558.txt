Participant 46:
I think they're the same. My hoarding had not changed until I fell last year, and I needed space, and then I started really concentrating. It sounds funny, on the hoarding shows it's like therapy. And I noticed that everybody in the hoarding TV shows denied that they were hoarders. So the first thing I guess is acceptance in my life, and I said, "Okay, I think I just feel like..." I always knew I was a hoarder, but I think in the last couple of years I finally accepted, "Okay, you are a hoarder. You cannot see the word free." Because anybody who's have anything free came to my house. So I tried not to access any free sites anymore. I try to bypass free stuff on the street.

So then-
Participant 46:
So I just-
Interviewer:
That's good. It sounds like you are aware of triggers. I know that's important. 
Participant 46:
Yes, now in the last two years I've decided, I mean, I always knew the trigger but I couldn't help myself. So it's even eating. Because I was deprived, if there's a bunch of food in front of me I have to eat it all, and now I just don't bring it home. So if I don't bring it home, I know I won't eat it, right? But if I order it, I eat it. I don't care if it feed 10, I will eat it. So it's almost like hoarding food, too. I do hoard food. 
Interviewer:
You do? That is one of... What items do you hoard? 
Participant 46:
Okay, I do hoard food. I do hoard clothes. I do hoard stuff. Anything-
Interviewer:
What would you consider the most valuable, and how do you choose what to keep?
Participant 46:
Okay. Right now I'm just dividing into, "Does this have any...," I haven't gone into deeper levels, so I take a one and a ten, and I split it into five. If it's five and below, and has absolutely no sentimental value, like a spice jar, I will try and let that one item go. I will even sometimes, like as my brother, "Do you think this has any value?" And he goes, "No." Because what's interesting about me, is on the opposite end I'm actually an organizer. I can do everybody else's hoarding. I have cleaned up enough work sites that they ask me to come out and clean it up. If I have no self-involvement, I know what's bad and good, and what I can keep. But if it belongs to me, I can't tell. I can't tell if it's worthy or not, so the most important things of course are family objects, and very-
Interviewer:
Family objects, you consider the most important?
