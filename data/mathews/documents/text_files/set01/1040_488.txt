Participant 040:
Well, no. I have a drawer full full of scarves, to accessorize.
And occasionally when I play with the drawer, something will stick out.
That's a no no. I've got to push that or rearrange what's in that drawer so that when I close it, there's nothing sticking out.
Interviewer:
Are-
Participant 040:
I know that's a-
Interviewer:
I'm sorry.
Participant 040:
Problem for some people.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 040:
The drawers are a mess.
What room in the house is wonderful is the bathroom.
Interviewer:
Bathroom?
Participant 040:
Bathroom.
It has a laundry basket in there, actually it has two, one for white clothes and one for colored.
My husband throws whatever in the right place and I do all it rather regularly.
There may be a load that stays in the dryer for a while, that doesn't come up.
Interviewer:
Would you say that overall there's not that much clutter in the bathroom, or that there is?
Participant 040:
Oh, there's no clutter in the bathroom.
Interviewer:
No clutter in the bathroom, okay.
Participant 040:
Nope, no... I don't wear makeup, so there's no makeup cluttering the sink area.
Anything I need is behind a cupboard and even my towels are in a pile.
The wash clothes, they're not just thrown in there.
Now, there's one shelf, it's a jumble of medical accessories like hand braces, wrist braces, stuff you put on your head for... [INAUDIBLE].
I brought it home from the hospital.
Cold bags.
There's just a jumble of first aid, bandaids, multiple boxes of bandaids.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Participant 040:
Anyway, that shelf's a mess, but the door can be closed and nobody knows that they're there.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Participant 040:
[INAUDIBLE] towels.
I've got two shelves of towels and wash clothes and they're in straight order, folded neatly.
Interviewer:
So okay, so sounds like there's not much clutter in the bathroom.
Would you say that that's also true of the kitchen or your bedroom?
Participant 040:
The kitchen, I never set anything on the stove.
That's one of those safety rules.
But the counter sometimes get usurped by stuff.
But my husband does the cooking, so he's very quick to inform me that I need to pick this up, put it someplace else.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Okay.
Participant 040:
I often wonder what my house would be like if he were not here.
I shudder.
Interviewer:
Shudder?
Participant 040:
Shudder.
S-H-U-D-D-E-R.
Interviewer:
Do you think it would be more cluttered?
Participant 040:
I believe it would be.
Interviewer:
Speaking of that, would your ideal home look any different than it does now?
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Can you-
Participant 040:
Might have a certain minimum of things, and there would always be a place to sit down in the living room.
Interviewer:
Okay, so there'd be-
