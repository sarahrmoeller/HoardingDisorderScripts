Interviewer:
Are there any objects that are most important to you or things that you spend a lot of time with?
Interviewee7:
Yeah, I would say most important to me would be the things that I inherited from my parents, the objects that were important to them that are important to me.
I would say that my mother probably was a hoarder also, except that my dad would throw things out when she didn't know it.
Interviewer:
Are there any parts of your house that you would consider cluttered?
Interviewee7:
I would say that you would think that my eBay selling room or my Craigslist room is cluttered.
Actually, you know what, probably every room is cluttered.
For somebody to come in here, I would be surprised...
Even my great room that is so huge that has all the toys around it, people would probably say that it's all cluttered, but in my kitchen, we have four counter tops and two are very big.
Those stay, and especially the counters around the sink, those stay empty.
That's for when people come in or when we come in with groceries or something.
We have a place to put stuff before [INAUDIBLE] put away.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Interviewee7:
I would say of any room, the kitchen...
Although my window sill is cluttered.
It's cluttered with cards that people sent me.
I have cards up there from birthdays and mother's day and things that people gave me.
I look up there while I'm doing the dishes and I remember people.
Interviewer:
Okay, but you'd say overall that the kitchen is probably your least cluttered room.
Is that what I'm...
Interviewee7:
That and Jerry's bathroom, yeah.
Interviewer:
Are there any parts of your home that you don't use?
I know with all the bedrooms, you don't necessarily use them all regularly, but...
Interviewee7:
Right, that I don't...
Like closets that I don't go into you mean?
Interviewer:
Sure, yeah, any rooms that you might not use or go into or that you just...
Yeah, sure, don't go into.
Interviewee7:
I actually go into every single room almost every single day or at least a couple of times a week.
The reason I do that is that I want to make sure that things are still neat and also I might catch something that I might want to sell or do something with.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Interviewee7:
Takes me like 15 minutes just to open the door and look in and close the door.
Interviewer:
Are there any parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they're intended?
For example, a bathtub that you don't really use for bathing.
