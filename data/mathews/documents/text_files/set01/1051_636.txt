Participant:
Like do I, do I love it? And secondary to that would be, what is its, what is its monetary value. Because some of these skeins were extremely expensive. But that's kind of secondary to it. Really, I'm trying to only keep the things, the yearn anyways, that are giving me pleasure. Either through feel or through color, through vision. And, somebody told me something once and I'm trying, I'm trying really hard to live by it. Which is, you know, use what you have. Because I have a tendency to save it for something special, or save it for future use, when in fact the sheep are still growing. The fiber. And people are still spinning it, and people are still dyeing it. So, if I use it up, there'll be more to replace it.
Interviewer (35:39): Yeah, definitely.
Participant:
But, but I think that's how I got into this, this having so much, was that I was afraid to keep using.
Interviewer (35:50): Okay.
Participant:
And then I would buy more, and that's just ridiculous.
Interviewer (35:55): So, I noticed you said earlier that, um, it's pretty common for people that are in this craft to have and collect all of these yarns like you. What would you say are some differences between what's considered normal saving behavior, like if someone else were a knitter and they had, you know, a bunch of yarns, and your own behavior, in terms of collecting things?
Participant:
Um… I don't know that there is a lot of difference. I think one of the differences might be that I held on to some of the cheap crappy yarn longer than I should have, and I need to just give it away. Because I by no means have the largest yarn stash I have ever seen. By no means. But I do have a stash of crappy Hobby Lobby, Joann Fabrics-type acrylic yarns that I will never, ever, ever knit with. And I need to just, I need to just— and that’s what I started giving away.
Interviewer (37:09): Okay, so for you the difference between normal saving and what would be considered like, clutter problems is saving things that aren't entirely useful?
Participant:
Right, or not— or, or have no perceived value in my mind.
Interviewer (37:25): Okay.
Participant:
You know we, we talked about things like being a yarn snob or depending on, you know whatever, whatever your craft or hobby or your passion is. You know, you always want to have the best of it. And there's always going to be something that you look down your nose at and say, well, I would never use that, or I would never wear that. Then why keep it?
Interviewer (37:48): Right.
Participant:
And I have kept it. And so that would be, that to me would be the biggest gap between the two.
