Participant 32:
I live in a split level home, three-bedroom, two-bath home.
And I'm on almost five acres of land.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Participant 32:
Yeah, and out of town a little way.
Yeah, it's great.
I love it, love it.
Interviewer:
Okay, and do you live alone?
Participant 32:
Yes, I live alone.
Yeah, I'm single and always have been.
Interviewer:
And what would you like your home to look like in terms of... I know that you said that you would like everything to have a place.

So, no, I'm able to...
The floors are pretty good, not perfect but I will say there's a lot of stuff.
I do call it an obstacle course sometimes but a lot of it is things for my cats.
I have two cats and I spoil them rotten and so I have cat towers and cat chairs and cat beds and cat toys.
So, there is a lot... A lot of the clutter I will say is cat-related and that probably won't change very much but I don't know.
But as far as my stuff...
Interviewer:
Okay, so your floors are pretty good.
Participant 32:
Yes.
CROSSTALK yeah.
Interviewer:
And how important are your things for you to feel at home?
Like if you didn't have your objects with you would you still feel comfortable and feel like you are in your home?
Participant 32:
If I didn't have my what with me?
Interviewer:
Your objects.
So, say like your-
