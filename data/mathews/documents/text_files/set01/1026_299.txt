Interviewer:
So you would like it to just be the same room but just with all of the clutter completely gone?
Participant 26:
Right, right.
Interviewer:
Are there any items that you consider clutter that you would keep?
Participant 26:
No-
Interviewer:
I guess I'm wondering are any of the items important to you or that you like but maybe not in the right place right now?
Participant 26:
No, those kinds of things I don't have a problem dealing with if I like them.
But it's mostly the paperwork, the books, the newspapers and the toys.
Interviewer:
And ideally you would just like all of that stuff to be gone?
Participant 26:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
When you think about feeling at home in your space, do you feel like it's nice to have your items around or to have books to look at or papers to read?
Do you feel like those items are important for you feeling at home, or ideally they would just be gone and you don't really need them in your home space?
Participant 26:
I think what's relevant I would like to have.
Reading materials that I'm currently reading, but the clutter that I'm talking about goes back years.
Interviewer:
So you're not attached to that at all, you would just like to eliminate it?
Participant 26:
I would, but I just can't seem to get to it.
Interviewer:
So we've talked a little bit about being sentimentally attached to items, and I guess thinking about all of the things in your home, which ones are the most important to you, which ones do you value?
Participant 26:
Which items?
I would say the house itself, certain rooms that I enjoy being in, I would have to say that if the place burned down what would I miss?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 26:
If I had to replace everything I would be okay.
Interviewer:
Would you miss those sentimental items from your children's childhood?
Are there items like that that you feel very attached to?
Participant 26:
You know what?
I would feel a sense of relief because then the decision will have been made for me.
Interviewer:
It will save you the task of having to-
Participant 26:
Absolutely yeah, because sometimes I've gone through stuff in the basement and papers and things have gotten kind of moldy and falling apart.
I'm like, well I should just throw this away, and then it's like, thank god.
Interviewer:
Yeah it's gone, yeah.
Participant 26:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So how do you make decisions about throwing things away?
How do you decide when it's time to just toss it?
Participant 26:
You mean going forward or with these things that have accumulated?
