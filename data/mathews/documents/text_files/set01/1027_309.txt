Interviewer:
Based off what you said earlier, it sounds like you don't believe that this is a problem because these are things that you give to others or that you eventually need.
Is that correct?
Participant 27:
Yeah, that and also some of the things are very emotionally important to me because they are games that I played with my children.
I do sell some things on Craigslist.
I've made about $500 in the past month on selling things, but I like to do it that way because I meet the people.
They want the item because it's important to them or they can use it.
I just sold the Apple II computer, the second computer ever built.
It belonged to my son in law and then it belonged to my son, but I really didn't have an attachment to it.
I was saving it because it was cool, and I liked looking at it, but it really didn't mean anything to me.
It takes a lot for me to sell something, but if I don't think I'm going to need it in the future, I don't have somebody to give it to, and it has no meaning for me, then I can get rid of it, but I want to get rid of to somebody who is not going to put it at the end of their driveway for the trash people to come and crush.
That kills me.
Interviewer:
Okay, so making sure that it goes somewhere where it's going to be of use.
Participant 27:
Yeah.
Like this Fisher-Price tool...
It's a whole big thing.
Why would somebody put that out for the trash?
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Participant 27:
I don't know.
Interviewer:
Have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Participant 27:
No. Interviewer:
So you've never gone to any professional for help for this behavior or anything?
Participant 27:
No, no. I also hoard... I really like to collect sayings, inspirational stories, inspirational pictures.
I just bought three more filing cabinets.
I already have one, two, three, four, five... I already have six filing cabinets, and I just bought three more.
I'm trying to file this stuff, but the thing is that I really like looking up and reading an inspirational saying on the...
I'm sitting here at my desk and in front of me is a thank you note.
I was a nanny, and my nanny little boy wrote to me when he was about 10.
He's now about 23.
I look at it and I think of him, and that gives me pleasure.
Interviewer:
That's nice.
Participant 27:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How do your family and friends feel about your behavior or feel about hoarding?
