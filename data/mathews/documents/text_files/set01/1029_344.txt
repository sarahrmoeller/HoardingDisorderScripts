Oh, that reminded me of something else.
Sometimes because you're not dealing ...
You have too many papers, you might get late charges on a bill that you've overlooked because I'm not organized.
And that just annoys me.
I can pay it, fortunately I had a good career and I can pay it, but it's annoying.
I don't want that to happen.
And I'm trying to set a better system just for myself, like I'm using reminders on my phone now, things like that, so that that doesn't happen.
But that doesn't come naturally to me, it's not an easy process for me.
I rarely just like to get the mail and dump it in a pile.
... So I consider that a problem.
And I've had my water turned off once, I had no idea why.
Interviewer:
Like, "That must've been a paper I missed."
Participant 29:
I didn't realize that I hadn't paid my water bill.
I'm like, "What?" And I pay it in chunks, like $500 at a time.
So those envelopes came in and I just don't open them.
So I don't know if that's part of hoarding, or if that's something else.
Interviewer:
It's probably all related.
Participant 29:
Pardon me?
Interviewer:
It's probably all related.
Participant 29:
Yeah, I think it is.
So those are ways [INAUDIBLE] my life.
Interviewer:
Have you ever had family and friends that have approached you about this behavior?
Participant 29:
No. Well, except like I told my friends that I had my water bill turned off, and they're like, "You're not opening your mail again?" I'll say stuff about myself, so they know that.
But it's not like they feel like, they haven't had to do an intervention on me.
Interviewer:
So they've noticed these small things such as like if you mention that you haven't paid a bill, or if you mention that the mess has annoyed you.
They know about it through that?
But they don't necessarily feel as big of a problem as you see it?
Participant 29:
No, because I look like I'm all together to the outside world.
I make sure I'm properly dressed.
I take care of myself in the home that they see.
So I don't think they can truly imagine it.
If they're talking about something like in that realm, I'll say, "Oh yeah, I know what you mean.
I didn't pay my water bill because I don't open my mail."
So I do have one friend who asked me occasionally, "Have you opened your mail recently?"
Interviewer:
They're looking out for you.
Participant 29:
Pardon me?
Interviewer:
They're looking out for you.
Participant 29:
Exactly.
I don't mind that she says that, and I tell her the truth.
And sometimes it's yes, and sometimes it's no.
