Participant:
Ok because ok my house could be a lot neater but I want things around me. But I would say 7 seven and a half.
Interviewer - Ok seven and a half. Ok. And why would you say it’s a seven and a half like in comparison to you other, other times?
Participant:
I know my other rooms, my kitchen, my bathroom, stuff like that, there’s not stuff in there. It’s neat; clean. It’s where I am all the time and it looks really piled up.
Interviewer:
And where are you most of the time?
Participant:
Well I’m in my living room and I work out of my living room. So, I work on Ebay so I two big, huge bins  in the living room and I’ve got my Ebay stuff stacked in the corner. I’m sitting in a chair right now, there’s a bookshelf beside me with piles. But, I know where everything is. People will look at it and say, “How do you find anything?” I put my hand right on it. But if you look in your place and say “where is that pile?”
Interviewer:
Right
Participant:
Is this making sense?
Interviewer:
Yes. Completely.
Participant:
and I feel comfortable with my stuff around me.
Interviewer:
So to other people it would appear like it’s a mess, but to you it all makes perfect sense
Participant:
Oh yeah everything’s there.
Interviewer:
And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah?
Participant:
Yeah it actually is because I live with my husband; I live with my brother and it causes problems with other people because number one they live here and the house is cluttered with my stuff. Or they can’t move around. You know the living room would be a lot bigger if I didn’t have big huge forty gallon bins in here.  But I have my Ebay stuff in there. I could put it in another room but I want it here.
Interviewer:
So you believe that your behavior is a problem because it affects other people
Participant:
Other people UNCLEAR
Interviewer:
If they weren’t in the equation would you want; would you consider the behavior a problem for yourself?
Participant:
No. Actually no. It’s comforting to me. Is that fair?
Interviewer:
I think that’s fair.
Participant:
Now if I had trash on the floor and you know fast food things and that yeah that would UNCLEAR but I don’t do that. I just have stuff around me. I don’t have no garbage around me.
Interviewer:
Ok. And have you ever sought to change this behavior? Like gone to a professional for help?
Participant:
No. I mean no. You know what I do? I keep telling myself “One day NAME, you going to move into a bigger place. You can have this one room for your hoarding, office, clutter room.” And then it makes me feel better.
Interviewer:
Ok.
