Interviewer:
Okay. You think that because you have an issue with hoarding, that you would notice that? Or do you think that if you didn't have one, maybe you wouldn't be as cognizant of it as you are now?
Participant 006:
I probably would not be as cognizant of it.
Interviewer:
Okay. You mentioned that you had gone up to the internet to find some information. Have you tried going anywhere else or other places that you heard of it, other than the TV?
Participant 006:
No. Just, I've looked at websites and I've watched those TV shows and organization shows. I've read a couple organization books on how to get over the hoarding, but nothing's really helped. I guess it's helping, to the point where I know that I have an issue and I really want to do this, clean it out, get myself back on track.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah.
Participant 006:
It happens. But the desire to go out and shop though, I've got to tell you, even during quarantine, it's very easy not to go. But I find myself thinking, I can't wait to go to Goodwill, or I can't wait to go look for that, you know?
Interviewer:
Yeah, no, of course. What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Participant 006:
I think about myself. I think about my home, and how it looks piled with things.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. Now I want to focus a little bit more on COVID impact. I know we talked a little bit about it. I want to talk about the specific behaviors that changed. You said that COVID has helped you a little bit, because you haven't been able to go out and get as much stuff.
Participant 006:
That is correct.
Interviewer:
Okay. Has it impacted your difficulties with discarding?
Participant 006:
It may have made things easier for me to, because I'm looking at it constantly. I'm not running around. I'm looking at the stuff that I have and I have gradually started going through and for instance, I mentioned to you, the books. As soon as the local little church shop opened, I took a truckload of books to them. So yeah, in that way, in that I'm sitting here looking at it and thinking about it constantly, it has helped me get started going through some of it, and ridding myself of some of it. Does that makes sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. How do you think it's affected your sense of connectedness and attachment? Do you think you've been seeing it more negative?
Participant 006:
You mean with family and friends?
Interviewer:
Yeah, like family and friends as well. Or just your attachment to your items.
Participant 006:
I think maybe it's helped me, because there's so much of it, I realize it's not important.
Interviewer:
All right.
Participant 006:
Go ahead.
Interviewer:
No, no, finish.
