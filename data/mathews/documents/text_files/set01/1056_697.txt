Participant:
If I’ve been accused of being a hoarder, not really.
Interviewer: Okay. And how do you react to the words hoarding disorder?
Participant:
Doesn’t bother me at all.
Interviewer: Okay, so, you, I mean you don’t really think that it’s an issue, so it doesn’t necessarily offend you or anything like that?
Participant:
That is correct. Not that I don’t think it’s an issue, but even if I did think that it was an issue it wouldn’t offend me.
Interviewer: Right. But you said that it definitely could be an issue so there are some negative connotations that you might associate with it?
Participant:
Yes, that is correct.
Interviewer: Okay, so, now we’re gonna talk a little bit about any sort of distress or interference collecting things has had on your life, or that hoarding has had on your life. So, for you personally, does collecting things or hoarding in your office necessarily upset you?
Participant:
Um… only when it generates a mental conflict between me and significant other.
Interviewer: Okay. So, if it were just you, or maybe before in your life when it was just you, did it upset you at all ever?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer: Okay. So, if you lived at all by yourself for example, do you think it would bother you at all that you had these rooms that were a little bit cluttered?
Participant:
Um no, but it did probably limit my um… invitations to others to come into my home.
Interviewer: Okay. So, was there ever a time when maybe you wanted someone in your home or to invite someone over and um, you felt limited because of you know the clutter, or because of a certain room in your house being disorganized or having stuff in it?
Participant:
Um, I wouldn’t say that when I wanted to have someone come over, they would come over. The level of stuff was not such a big deal that I couldn’t stuff it all behind the curtains or walls or whatever so that it was not apparent at all at the point of time of the visitation.
Interviewer: Okay, so, it seems like you’re saying that you’ve never really had so much stuff that it was impossible to, you know, clean it up a little bit for the sake of having someone over or anything like that?
Participant 056
That is correct.
Interviewer: Okay, so—
Participant:
But, but I will acknowledge that some cleaning would take place before company would come over.
Interviewer: Right, right. So, what would that cleaning up constitute? What would that look like for you?
Participant:
It would just be um, repositioning boxes of stuff.
Interviewer: Okay.
