Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
I mean, I've still got stuff that I can look at and say, "I haven't worn this for years" but yet I don't want to get rid of it.
Interviewer:
Of course.
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Like a swimsuit.
Interviewer:
Okay.
To choose between items, "These are the items that I've used most recently which may mean I might get more use out of them and then the rest can go"?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
It's also easier, for me, to get rid of stuff if I know there's a place I can use it.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay.
Interviewee:
It's like the cloth face masks I'm making.
I have lots and lots and lots of fabric.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
I'm able to get rid of some of that fabric by putting it to use.
Interviewer:
What would you say are the most important differences between collecting and saving and then hoarding?
Interviewee:
Hoarding is probably ...
Well, hoarding is unnecessary.
Actually, the word collecting, to me, fits almost into the negative category.
To me, in a sense, hoarding is collecting.
Interviewer:
Okay.
You would say the difference between saving type behavior and hoarding and/or collecting would be continually keeping items that are not of use?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What would you say hoarding disorder looks like?
Interviewee:
To me, it's having too many things that I know that ... A lot of times when people refer to hoarders, I think of the show Mission Organization where somebody's got trash and then even dead pets and stuff living underneath the stuff.
My place is nothing like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
You might define ...
Would you say that it's on a spectrum then?
Interviewee:
Sorry.
Can you repeat that?
Interviewer:
Would you say it's on a spectrum?
Would you say there's different levels of severity in terms of hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Yeah.
I think so.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Based off of the things you kind of mentioned what hoarding looks like, would you say this is the same or different from your behavior of difficulties with clutter?
Interviewee:
Can you repeat that one more time?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Of course.
When I asked what does hoarding disorder look like, you described this lower side of things piling up but then you also described what you've seen on reality TV shows where there's trash and maybe they haven't taken care of their pets.
You described it as two different ways to describe hoarding disorder.
Would you say either or those, or even somewhere in between, is the same or different from your difficulties with clutter?
Interviewee:
Mine is the papers and stuff and clutter.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
But you wouldn't say that really keeping trash and things like that is an issue for you?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being inside their home?
