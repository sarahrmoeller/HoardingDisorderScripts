Interviewer:
Yeah. Really, it gets in the way of others sitting down or when you really need to find something, it might be underneath things?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
Can you describe a specific time where your difficulties with clutter got in the way of something that you really wanted?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
There's been times that I've looked all over papers.
Like I had something with my taxes and I couldn't find it and then found it maybe two months later.
Or something that I saw on TV that I wanted to have and I knew that I had gotten it but I couldn't find it and then I thought maybe I didn't take it with me when I moved so I bought it again.
Interviewer:
It really gets in the way when you're trying to look for something that you need.
That's when it becomes frustrating?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I know you've mentioned that you had the professional organizer come so that, to me, kind of says that you'd like to change this behavior.
Is that true?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Is that because you feel embarrassed and you want to have people over without worrying?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I think that it would be somewhat freeing.
Interviewer:
Freeing?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
I understand that.
We talked about prior that you would be upset at first if you had to get rid of the bear that you gave your mom.
Would you be upset if you had to get rid of any of your other items?
Interviewee:
No, there's things that when I'm going through things that I'll find and I'll think, "I don't need this anymore" or, "This is broken so get rid of it" or, "I can't find the cord to this so what's the point?"
Interviewer:
Right.
You would just save things that you really feel that you have an emotional connection with?
It may be difficult but the things that you can reason, "Okay, these aren't useful" then it doesn't upset you to get rid of them?
Interviewee:
That's true.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well, that pretty much concludes our discussion portion of the interview.
