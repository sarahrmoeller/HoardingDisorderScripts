Interviewer:
Okay. The first scenario is that John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When the items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy in one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized but is usually not cluttered. Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.
In this scenario, do you think John Doe could potentially have hoarding disorder? Is this a behavior similar to having clutter problems? Why?
Participant 005:
I would say the fact that he is saving all sorts of boxes and all sorts of sizes, just in case, and I think you described it as he doesn't want to throw away something that he might need in the future, that signals to me some amount of ... I'm not sure if it's hoarding or clutter. I would say the hoarding mentality, losing your keys and finding ... I don't see that as ... Everyone does that. It would just be that whole thought of, "I can't throw away this box because if I did, if I need it in the future, what would happen." That's the part that kind of signals to me that, yes, he has a bit of it.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Do you think that John Doe should change his behavior or seek treatment for anything?
Participant 005:
That's a question so personal for the actual person. It sounds like he needs treatment, intervention but maybe some tools to be able to separate from you can find boxes elsewhere when you need one. You're taking up an entire closet for that one potential need. To help him just get through that would probably benefit him.
