Interviewee47:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Interviewee47:
Like what to keep?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee47:
What do you mean?
If I had to-
Interviewer:
I guess just the criteria of how you would choose.
Interviewee47:
To get rid of anything, or what?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess if you had to choose the criteria of what type of items you would keep if you had to choose between items.
Interviewee47:
Probably keep the ones that were in good shape or from a family or friend that is gone, that I couldn't recycle or that someone else didn't need.
Something that would mean something just to me.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee47:
That's probably my criteria.
Interviewer:
So meaning to more than just yourself.
Interviewee47:
What do you mean?
Interviewer:
Just that you were saying if it has meaning to not just yourself, but other people as well.
Interviewee47:
No, I just mean if it just meant something to me.
Interviewer:
Oh, I'm sorry.
I misunderstood you.
Okay.
Interviewee47:
It's okay.
Interviewer:
So these questions now are going to be about distinguishing hoarding behavior with just normal behavior.
What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting and hoarding disorder?
Interviewee47:
I think it's in the way a person can look at an item and decide quickly whether it's really worth saving.
My daughter in law, oh it's expired, it's going.
It's just like a real non ... it's a very detached analytical way of looking at an item.
There's nothing attached to it.
It's like, this is an item, simply a cup, and you have 15 cups already.
This cup can go.
It's just a very detached analytical logical way of dealing with everything really.
Interviewer:
So they're just taking the emotion out of it is what you're saying.
Interviewee47:
Yeah, take the emotion out of it.
Probably, if they went to the store, they would get one of something that maybe I'd get two of.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee47:
They would get less of something.
Interviewer:
It sounds like minimalism.
Interviewee47:
Minimalism, yeah.
Minimalism and detachment.
There's no attachment to a material or inanimate object.
There's nothing attached to it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
