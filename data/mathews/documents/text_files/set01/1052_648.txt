Interviewer (31:39): Okay, and that kind of seems like it’s just a matter of utility, right? That seems like a very useful thing, right?
Participant:
Yup. 
Interviewer (31:49): Okay. So, if you were to somehow lose this external hard drive, that would be pretty traumatic I assume. But, what about the precious items in your home that are maybe less useful, but you still have a lot of value in? What would happen if say, suddenly your musical instruments were to disappear? 
Participant:
Well, I’m trying to remind myself that they’re things. I recognize that if we were to not live in a hurricane zone— you’re University of Florida is that right?
Interviewer (32:32): Mhmm.
Participant:
Yeah, you’ve been visited by I-don’t-know how many destructive hurricanes. 
Interviewer (32:40): Right, a number of them.
Participant:
Yeah, I’ve never experienced the trauma of watching a roof come off, or the trauma of being up to your knees in floodwater washed through. That sounds devastating.
Interviewer (32:57): Right, so you’re able to kind of recognize that it isn’t a catastrophic deal if things are lost.
Participant:
No, uh— yes, I’m agreeing with you. 
Interviewer (33:11): Okay, so if you had to choose between a number of the items that you just told me were really precious to you, how would you choose between them?
Participant:
That’s an ongoing power game at one of the‚ actually the only social media site that I participate in. You know, “if there’s a fire which would you grab?” And that’s mostly a power game. But, there’s, that would probably be one of the electrics and one of the acoustics. 
Interviewer (33:46): And why would you choose those?
Participant:
So, the red Deli(?) it’s because the funds that we used to buy it came as a result of a modest inheritance from my maternal grandmother. And the Casey(?) acoustic it was, uh, selected for me, recommended for me by a performing artist I’ve got a relationship with. He was right, it’s a pretty good guitar. 
Interviewer (34:20): Right, so both of the things that you would choose to keep, there’s an aspect of sentimentality with them, right?
Participant:
Yes. 
Interviewer (34:28): Okay. How about monetary value? Do you assign a lot of worth in something that’s financially valuable?
Participant:
That’s actually discussed quite a bit on the social media site as well. There’s all, we’re a bunch of aging Boomers who put a bunch of value into just wood and wire. And, recognizing that the next generation that follows may not hold some of the same reverence for the British phase that some of us did, and our stuff will just be crap that’s gotta be thrown away. And, in some of our cases that’s helping us— it’s certainly helping me— to resist further acquisition. A person with my gaping schedule has no reason to have more than eight guitars.
Interviewer (35:32): So, for you if something is financially valuable, that’s not necessarily as important?
