Participant 30:
[INAUDIBLE] Maybe a little bit of a problem.
It's kind of, I think what the main problem is I think it does create stress because when I look at stacks of papers, I think I really need to do something with that, but I've got all these other things I need to do so it kind of just doesn't get done.
I do make some progress...
With the pandemic, everything was closed down.
I made a little bit of progress with papers, but not a lot.
Interviewer:
Right, right.
How do your friends and family feel about your clutter problems?
Have you ever had any sense of conflicts with them about it?
Participant 30:
My mother's made remarks about it, she's kind of a neat freak.
But I think that's the reason I think there's a genetic component because my mom was a super neat freak, and I only had one sibling, I had a brother and he was that way too.
I think my dad was more sloppy, although I wouldn't say that he accumulated a lot of stuff.
My husband's very tolerant.
He's not a super neat freak, fortunately so he just...
As long as it, it hasn't become a big problem, as far as I haven't gotten to the point, I'm not at the point where like you hear about some of these people that have, like they can't throw out food wrappers and things like that.
It's clutter, but it's not filth.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay.
Where you live now, you live with your husband you said?
Participant 30:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What is the space like?
What does the clutter kind of look like your in home?
Participant 30:
Well I have alot of papers...
But I don't think I can throw them out until I read them, and my dining table is covered with papers.
Then I have a little, it was like an enclosed porch that's kind of a spare room, and originally that's where I put my sewing machines and ironing board, but now they're completely covered with boxes of things, kind of when I want to make room, I sort of put things in that one room, and now it's like, it's not really very usable.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
So there's definitely areas of your home that you can't quite use to the full extent that you normally would because of the clutter?
Participant 30:
Right.
I would say that's true.
I have one room like that, and then also the dining room table, if I really need to, I would have to just put everything, they're kind of in separate piles, and I would have to just stack them all somewhere to be able to use the dining table.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Other than the dining table, is there any other parts of the home that you don't use?
Participant 30:
No, not really.
It's a fairly small house.
