Participant 040:
Well no, not...
Well, the... let's see.
The sodas, the tops kind of swirls.
It would pretty just to put some INAUDIBLE lace or INAUDIBLE around the bottom of it.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you have three boxes of those.
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 040:
They're cluttering up the...
No, wait a minute.
They're both places, both the dining room and what we used to call the dead sea.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Participant 040:
I decided I did not like the term dead sea because it was the room at the end of a hall.
Interviewer:
Oh. Participant 040:
Things went in, but they never came out.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you call it the dead sea because a lot of stuff accumulated there and they wouldn't come back out?
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Yeah, that's that room I've taken over in the back.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Participant 040:
And it's the room that has the six inch space that you have to go sideways to get through.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Okay.
Okay, got you.
So would you say that overall it's difficult for you to throw things away?
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
I apologize if I've asked that.
Participant 040:
Unless they're truly trash.
Interviewer:
Okay, unless they're truly trash, like a wrapper.
Participant 040:
Yeah, a candy wrapper.
Interviewer:
A candy wrapper.
Participant 040:
That goes in the trash.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 040:
Tissues, dirty tissues.
Interviewer:
Those go in the trash, okay.
Participant 040:
I had a problem with...
Well, I would gurgle up food reflex.
It was quite bad and I could fill a small trash can quickly with tissues.
And they went in the trash.
They did not get saved.
What else do I have no trouble throwing away?
Interviewer:
It's okay-
Participant 040:
INAUDIBLE labels.
Interviewer:
Labels?
Participant 040:
You'd think I'd save them, but I throw them out.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What would you say is the most precious item in your house for you?
Participant 040:
My most precious item?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE, if you had to pick one thing.
Or I guess a type of thing.
Participant 040:
Well, the lightening hit the back of the house in that dining room and started to burn.
And I asked the firemen to go into the sewing room and bring out the embroidered silk.
It was going to be used for my mother of the bride.
Well, I saved that.
The house didn't burn down, it just a lot of smoke, but that whole back room had to be re-done.
And that was one of the things I had found that finally, and it's irrational to have saved three yards of silk on a roll, but I did and he did, and I held it very carefully in my hand outside while we watched the firemen.
My new concept of a mess is a shag carpet filled with wet plaster and INAUDIBLE.
Interviewer:
So-
