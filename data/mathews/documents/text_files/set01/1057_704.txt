Interviewer:
Can you describe the rest of your house? Like how big is it?
Participant:
It’s two bedrooms, two and a half baths. So my wife and I have a bedroom and our little baby has a bedroom and bath and then downstairs we have like a living space that’s kind of continuous with the small kitchen and dining area and the garage and that’s about it.
Interviewer:
Is there anything that you would change about your home and how you organize things in it?
Participant:
Anything that I would change or how I’d organize it… not really, I mean I can’t think of anything right now, no.
Interviewer:
Okay. So how would you distinguish what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, or hoarding disorder?
Participant:
Yeah I would say like if the, if the collecting goes into like, if it, if it affects functionality or if it affects other areas in your life, then that would maybe move it to hoarding. For instance if you can’t, you know, move freely within your own home, or if, if there’s even like infestations of animals or insects or things like that that you are unaware about, and I feel like that would move into kind of like a hoarding situation.
Interviewer:
And you’ve never experienced any of these problems or had any sort of difficulties when it comes to clutter?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. So how would you say that your behavior is different from what you would depict as a hoarder, or hoarding behaviors?
Participant:
I mean, I don’t, I don’t feel any anxiety when I do get rid of something. Like for instance even if somebody, you know, kind of coerced me or forced me to get rid of something I don’t think that I would feel super anxious or even angry about something. I mean unless it obviously had like a lot of, a lot of, a lot of considerable meaning to me but as far as you know everyday materialistic things then I don’t have a problem with getting rid of those things.
Interviewer:
Are there any ways that you could tell if someone had hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant:
Without being in their home? Maybe if I noticed them like holding onto things that, you know, one might normally not hold onto like you know, yeah I don’t know I mean I think it would be difficult to tell if anybody was a hoarder outside of their own home.
Interviewer:
Where do you get information about hoarding disorder?
Participant:
Well, let’s see, I guess I mean I’ve had personal experiences moving people out of their homes and, and they would have what I consider hoarding disorder. Or I’ve also watched the shows on TLC and stuff like that where they kind of follow hoarders so that’s probably where I get most of my information I guess is-
