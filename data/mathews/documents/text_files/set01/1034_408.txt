Interviewer:
Okay. So, that was all the listing prompts that I have for you. And so this next interview section that we'll be moving into is more of question, answer. So the first thing I'd like you to describe to me is your problems with clutter and how long this has been going on. 
Participant 34:
I would just say that I keep perhaps more stuff that I need to in terms of thinking of documentation. I was a records manager professionally and worked in a court clerk's office managing court case records and leading a process that went from paper files to electronic files, saving huge amounts of space and increasing convenience and the speeding of the judicial process in the process. Anyway, so I developed habits of keeping stuff in case you need it. And that makes it harder to toss things out because it's a question of in case you need it, you have it. But again, that's just one way of thinking about it. You can rearrange your thinking to, in case I need these books, I have them, but as I get older, I'm going to have the opportunity to use them less and less. So putting them in other people's hands makes better use of them. 
And there are ways to donate or sell books, which I don't know a good by product of this study could be a handbook of, How to Get Rid of Stuff You've Got, for some in the process. 
Interviewer:
Well, the concern that you mentioned about thinking about, not necessarily being frustrated, but that concern that I have items that other people can use, that is really common it seems, as well as that belief that well, you would also be a great person for that use to go to as well. So there's kind of like those two thoughts in contrast. 
Participant 34:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, which is hard to deal with and probably leads to the accumulation of a lot of these books, which it sounds like you probably have on a lot of interesting and useful topics. 
Participant 34:
Yes. I have three or four themes of books that... I will always buy something if I see it that's new in that area. 
Interviewer:
So do your problems-
Participant 34:
And I have a Barnes and Noble account. 
Interviewer:
Do your problems mostly with clutter center around keeping books? 
Participant 34:
Well, I'd say it's largely books and documents. 
Interviewer:
And how severe would you say that this behavior is now, meaning can you walk through your spaces where you save items?
Participant 34:
Yes, I can. There's a few narrow spots because of overflow. But yeah, I have a closet that needs cleaning out. I can't see the floor yet at the moment. 
Interviewer:
Are there any other areas or is it particularly that closet? 
Participant 34:
That closet. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And did you mention that you live alone?
