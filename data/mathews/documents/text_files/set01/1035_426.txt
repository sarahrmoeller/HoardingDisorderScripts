Interviewer:
It sounds like some of what you'd like to change is related to just the usability of your space.
You'd like to be able to cook more in your kitchen, or sit on the chairs.
Some of it is more aesthetic.
It sounds like-
Participant 035:
Right.
Interviewer:
... in terms of the aesthetics, it's not important to you that everything be gone, or that everything be perfectly organized, but just that it's more welcoming.
I guess, what do you mean by welcoming?
What would that look like?
Participant 035:
Welcoming is, you'd feel comfortable coming in and sitting down, come in and sit and visit for a while, that anyone who comes over feels good, like I don't have to worry about breaking something, or making a mess, et cetera, et cetera, that it's comfortable.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like some of the things that you own are important for you to feel at home in your home?
Which things are those?
Participant 035:
Things that I own that're important for me to feel comfortable?
Interviewer:
Yeah, in your own home.
Things that you feel are homey in your house.
Participant 035:
Huh.
Like a comfy chair?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 035:
I have these two rescue dogs, it's a mother and daughter, and I got rid of a chair that was really worn out, it was a recliner.
It had wooden sides, so the dogs really couldn't snuggle up.
I thought, okay, this chair's going out.
I'll put it out the day before heavy trash day, and maybe somebody else can take it and recycle it, and sure enough, one of the neighbors picked it up.
I bought an oversized chair with giant arms and a huge footrest, so both dogs can sit with me now.
That's my favorite thing in the house right now.
Interviewer:
Your chair-
Participant 035:
Sounds crazy, but-
Interviewer:
No, your chair is your favorite spot, because you can be at home and with your dogs, and you can all be together and comfortable together in that space.
Participant 035:
Right.
I can pop the laptop over.
Right now, I've got a beading project set up on the loom, on an over-bed table that I can put in my lap and work, finish it, finish that up.
Interviewer:
All of the things that you might want to do are in reach?
Participant 035:
CROSSTALK.
It's like, this is the center of my daily life.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Yeah.
When you think about your items in your home, or the things that are cluttering your home, do you feel that they're valuable?
Participant 035:
Not particularly.
No.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Why do you say that?
