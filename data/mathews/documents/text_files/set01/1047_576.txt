Interviewer:
No. How important are your items for you to feel at home?
Interviewee47:
Pretty important.
Yeah, my agates.
I guess it's hard when ...
Well, the books, I really have to have the books around.
I like to have those.
I do actually reread books.
Some books I just have that I haven't read yet.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So which items do you feel you spend the most time with?
Interviewee47:
Probably the books and my rock collection.
Interviewer:
So are there any parts of your home that you don't use?
Interviewee47:
Yeah, there's one room that was my computer room, and that's the room that I'm working on.
I've just been working on this last week.
It's got my books and papers, things I can't part with like memorabilia from trips I took, photographs.
I can get from the door to the computer, and then it's a very narrow kind of corridor.
So that room, if some people come, I just close that door, close it totally off.
The living room looks okay, except now stuff from that room is kind of filtering into there because I have boxes to get rid of but, because nothing is open anymore, I can't get rid of them anymore, like the thrift store or anything.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee47:
Because I have books in there I don't use, I'm just going to give away.
So right now it's kind of hard because, with me, it's usually if I put them in the box and get them in the car, I can get rid of them.
But getting it to those points are the tricky part.
Interviewer:
Just trying to get it-
Interviewee47:
Getting them out of the house.
Interviewer:
Yeah, out of the space.
Interviewee47:
Because I'll look in there again and I'll be like, well do I really want to get rid of that?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee47:
Maybe I should keep that in case someone needs it.
It's like, no, it's so old that it's not even ...
It's a science book.
It's not even ...
Those things aren't even true anymore.
They're outdated.
Interviewer:
It's outdated, yeah.
Interviewee47:
Yeah.
Some of this stuff is just ... yeah.
Interviewer:
So are there any parts of your home that aren't used in the intended way, other than your computer room that you use more for storage?
Interviewee47:
No. The bathroom is clear, the kitchen is clear, the bedrooms are clear.
I'm able to use all those.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So now I'm going to ask you a couple of questions about what makes things valuable to you and what do you consider things to be trash.
Interviewee47:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So when you think about your own possessions, I know you've mentioned memories of your family members and your books.
So when you think about your own possessions, what else makes them valuable?
