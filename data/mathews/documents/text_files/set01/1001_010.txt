Interviewee:
... guidelines. Their guidelines. Whereas up by my house, people are free for all. Hell, nobody wears a mask and nobody ... which I also don't like because there's a lot of creeps up there and I get worried-
Interviewer:
For sure.
Interviewee:
... with a kind of ... what's the word? Not lackadaisical but nonchalant kind of nonchalant attitude of people. But they've just ... there's one store where I live and they don't require masks. It's the only store I've been in ... how easy is it to stand at the door and say, "You can't come in unless you have a mask", and they won't do it and it drives me nuts. So I get angry.
Interviewer:
Yeah. I get angry too.
Interviewee:
Because when there are easy methods to ... and there's a bunch of creepy people up there. There's a bunch of pot growers, and it's not my favorite place. So yeah. I get upset.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Definitely. It's very tough to deal with people like that right now, for sure.
Interviewee:
It is.
Interviewer:
Uh-huh .
Interviewee:
And how hard is it? The masks are so cheap. You can just go buy a pack of five of them at the drug store and wear them.
Interviewer:
Exactly. Exactly.
Interviewee:
You know?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
And wear them.
Interviewer:
I know. It's really not that hard. I know.
Interviewee:
Tons of morons up here.
Interviewer:
Don't get me started.
Interviewee:
I won't get into ... I hope you're voting for Biden.
Interviewer:
Oh, definitely. Definitely.
Interviewee:
He's about to get rid of social security and I'm about ready to retire, but wearing masks. I'm sorry. It doesn't stand for anything. So all right.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Let me see. Let me see here. Have you had any specific techniques that you found helpful dealing with COVID-19? Is there any coping techniques that you've had?
Interviewee:
Yeah. You stay inside.
Interviewer:
You stay inside. Okay. Perfect.
Interviewee:
You stay inside. Coping... I just wear a mask and if people are shitty, I ignore them. And there are a bunch of ... not a bunch but there are some creepy people and there are some real ... like people are way over the top afraid. They're way over the top.
Interviewer:
Yeah. For sure.
Interviewee:
And I think I see what's happening with regard to companies like Twitter. We're here in Silicon Valley, so these big companies are not ... they're not going to have people come into work till next July. And that's not healthy.
Interviewer:
No. I agree.
Interviewee:
It's not healthy and I don't believe the people that are at home are working that hard. I just don't. And the reason they like it so much is because they can goof off. So they goof off. It's just bullshit. I'm sorry. That's just the way I feel about it.
