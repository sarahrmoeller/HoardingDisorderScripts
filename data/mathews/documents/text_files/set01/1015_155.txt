Interviewer:
Okay. So for all the things that might contribute to development of clutter difficulties, I have emotional attachment.
Think you'll need it in the future.
You just might like the items and how size contributes to it.
Would you like to add anything else?
Interviewee:
No, I think those are the main ones.
Interviewer:
All right.
So the next question is, can you please list all the reasons that you keep things?
Interviewee:
Well, kind of the same, somebody gave it to you or you like it or you think you'll use it.
I don't know or it could look nice if it's a vase or a something it's just special to you.
Interviewer:
So all the reasons that you keep things we have, it was gifted to you, you might just like it, it has a future use it looks nice or might have a special meaning to it.
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Would you like to add anything else the reason that you keep things.
Interviewee:
No. Mm-mm.
Interviewer:
All right.
So the next one is, can you please list all the ways that a person could identify someone with hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
I would say they have a messy house.
I think of someone with a hoarding disorder that is unkept themselves, unbathed.
I guess, outside their property usually would be messy too.
To me it's just a lot of stuff around.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So for all the ways that a person could identify someone with hoarding disorder, I have a messy house, they lack personal hygiene maybe, their property is messy and they might just keep a lot of things.
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Would you like to add anything else on that list?
Interviewee:
No. Mm-mm.
Interviewer:
All right.
And this is going to be our last one.
So if you can please list all the reasons that people might want to seek treatment for their difficulties with clutter.
Interviewee:
I think if it's gotten so difficult that they can't move around their house freely.
They would want to seek help.
Or if they're criticized by someone about their mess then they would want to seek help.
And family members probably would step in for the person to seek help, which they may or may not agree to.
But I think the main thing is that it has become a problem to get to stuff because other stuff is in the way, basically.
