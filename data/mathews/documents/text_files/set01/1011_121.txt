Participant 011:
Yeah, I feel that. And then when I get to friends of mine, I'm a little ill at ease. I'm afraid to hug people or handshake or do things I used to do because I do have an immune system that's not very smart. So, therefore, I have to be very careful of what I do out in public anymore. So it's been a downside for me in many ways.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah. How has COVID affected your habits? So have you found yourself buying more things during COVID or do you have difficulties with [crosstalk 01:11:01]
Participant 011:
I'd say I'm buying less things on COVID.
Interviewer:
Okay. You're buying less things. Okay.
Participant 011:
Yeah. I'm getting rid of more things and not buying any other than paper goods like everybody else does. Soap and bleach and things like that which I may be buying more of because of the fear that they're going to run out again. But other than that, I'm not buying any more foods. I'm not packing my freezer full of steaks. No, I'm just doing like I did previously. I mean, I'm not one of those guys who hoard food to a certain extent. I have a freezer but I don't put in 10 years' worth of food in there. So I haven't changed my eating habits because of COVID no, and I'm not hoarding food any more than I was before COVID. I just find it's harder now to get some of the foods that I used to eat pretty easy. Now I have to find them. I have to go around and find certain foods that I... They're getting harder to find some of the things I like. That's true. It's very difficult, very difficult.
Interviewer:
Yeah. How has COVID affected you financially?
Participant 011:
It's actually hurt me financially. My stocks and bonds have gone way down and some of my foreign investments have gone upside down. Some of my investments, including some of my collections, have lost their value so it's definitely affected me. But I'm well to do so it's not going to make any difference in the long run because I have trust funds and family gets everything. So it's not that I'm going to go broke or anything. It's just that we'll see if we rebound from this. This is going to be interesting.
