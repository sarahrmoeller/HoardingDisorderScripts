Participant 040:
It depends whether the stock market goes up or down, or whether the minimum distribution does funny things.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Participant 040:
It varies.
Interviewer:
Okay. Well, do you want me to give you some ranges, and you can pick the one that best applies.
Participant 040:
Yeah. We'll try that.
Interviewer:
Okay. So there's less than $10,000-
Participant 040:
No.
Interviewer:
$10,000 to $20,000?
Participant 040:
No.
Interviewer:
$20,000 to $35,000?
Participant 040:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. $35,000 to $50,000? $50,000 to $100,000?
Participant 040:
Yeah, there you go.
Interviewer:
$50,000 to $100,000?
Participant 040:
Yeah. That is a very broad range.
Interviewer:
Yes, that is a very broad range.
Participant 040:
I think that's right.
Interviewer:
Okay, and then which geographic region would best describe where you live in the US? So Northeast, Midwest-
Participant 040:
I'm in Virginia.
Interviewer:
Virginia. So, I guess the South. Would you consider that to be the South of the Northeast?
Participant 040:
Central coastal.
Interviewer:
Central Coastal. I don't have that option.
Participant 040:
Mid-Atlantic. That's the word.
Interviewer:
Mid-Atlantic. Yes. The Mid-Atlantic states.
Participant 040:
Is there one-
Interviewer:
Unfortunately there's not. So there's Northeast, Midwest, South.
Participant 040:
Then South.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. We only have four different regions there for some reason. What was your sex assigned at birth?
Participant 040:
My sex at birth?
Interviewer:
Yes, ma'am.
Participant 040:
Female.
Interviewer:
Okay. And is that also the gender you identify as?
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. Next one will be over a racial identification, and I'll give you a list, and you can select all that-
Participant 040:
Just put white.
Interviewer:
Okay. Just put white. Then do you identify as Hispanic or Latina?
Participant 040:
No. White.
Interviewer:
Well, that is all the questions I have for you. I will ask Rebecca to you a copy of the informed consent so that you have it for your records. I really appreciate, again, you taking this time to answer our questions. The only other thing I need to know is would you prefer to have your gift card mailed to you or sent to you through email?
Participant 040:
Mailed.
Interviewer:
Okay, and so Rebecca May reach out to you for an address for us to mail that.
Participant 040:
Okay. That would be fine.
Interviewer:
Perfect.
Participant 040:
I talked your ear off digressing.
Interviewer:
You've been wonderful. I really appreciate, again, your time doing all this.
Participant 040:
Thank you. I hope you didn't have someone who was supposed to call it 10.
Interviewer:
I did not.
Participant 040:
Good. I did not realize how the time has flown.
Interviewer:
It happens. Especially since we have so many questions.
Participant 040:
Yeah. It depends on whether people digress, and whether they have an answer that's quick and easy.
