Interviewee:
It depends whether the stock market goes up or down, or whether the minimum distribution does funny things.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Interviewee:
It varies.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well, do you want me to give you some ranges, and you can pick the one that best applies.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
We'll try that.

$50,000 to $100,000?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
That is a very broad range.
Interviewer:
Yes, that is a very broad range.
Interviewee:
I think that's right.
Interviewer:
Okay, and then which geographic region would best describe where you live in the US?
So Northeast, Midwest-
Interviewee:
I'm in Virginia.
Interviewer:
Virginia.
So, I guess the South.
Would you consider that to be the South of the Northeast?
Interviewee:
Central coastal.

Central Coastal.
I don't have that option.
Interviewee:
Mid-Atlantic.
That's the word.

The Mid-Atlantic states.
Interviewee:
Is there one-
Interviewer:
Unfortunately there's not.
So there's Northeast, Midwest, South.

Yeah.
We only have four different regions there for some reason.
What was your sex assigned at birth?
Interviewee:
My sex at birth?
Interviewer:
Yes, ma'am.
Interviewee:
Female.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And is that also the gender you identify as?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Next one will be over a racial identification, and I'll give you a list, and you can select all that-
Interviewee:
Just put white.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Just put white.
Then do you identify as Hispanic or Latina?
Interviewee:
No.
White.
Interviewer:
Well, that is all the questions I have for you.
I will ask Interviewer to you a copy of the informed consent so that you have it for your records.
I really appreciate, again, you taking this time to answer our questions.
The only other thing I need to know is would you prefer to have your gift card mailed to you or sent to you through email?
Interviewee:
Mailed.
Interviewer:
Okay, and so Interviewer May reach out to you for an address for us to mail that.
Interviewee:
Okay.
That would be fine.
Interviewer:
Perfect.
Interviewee:
I talked your ear off digressing.
Interviewer:
You've been wonderful.
I really appreciate, again, your time doing all this.
Interviewee:
Thank you.
I hope you didn't have someone who was supposed to call it 10.
Interviewer:
I did not.
Interviewee:
Good.
I did not realize how the time has flown.
Interviewer:
It happens.
Especially since we have so many questions.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
It depends on whether people digress, and whether they have an answer that's quick and easy.
