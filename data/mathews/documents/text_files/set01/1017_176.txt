Interviewer:
Okay. So, it seems like you have all ends of the spectrum within your children on how they feel about it.
One's completely against it, one has your behavior, and the other one is concerned for your health and safety, but understanding that sometimes it's nice to be able to find something because you have it.
Interviewee:
Exactly.
Like I said I'm so good at using... I was a writer for CURRATOR Times.
I could write articles for you.
Interviewer:
I'm not a writer at all, I'm not very good at being detailed.
Interviewee:
You're probably not a hoarder either.
Interviewer:
I don't know, I keep on to some things, but we'll see.
So you mentioned that you live alone, what does your space look like.
You said it was cluttered, but are there rooms that you can't access at all or is it you're not using for their intended purpose?
Interviewee:
There is one room that's supposed to be the library and that's filled with stuff, in addition to, books that don't fit on the shelves.
I really can't use that room, there's a pathway from one end of the room to the other, but to be able to walk around in there, no.
Interviewer:
Okay.
