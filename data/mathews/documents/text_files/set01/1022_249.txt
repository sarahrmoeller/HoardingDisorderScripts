Interviewee:
Usually it's about how much I spent on it, or if I've had it for really a long time.
It survived all these moves and I kept it.
I do a little survey of all my rooms in my house to see what I've had the longest in the room with all the objects.
Does that makes sense?
Yeah.
Interviewer:
You value them mostly on money, monetary value and how much time you spent with them?
Interviewee:
Yeah, mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What is trash for you?
What do you discard?
When do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Interviewee:
... And there lies the problem, right there.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Where it's become worn to the point where I don't need it anymore, clothing that's out of style or doesn't fit anymore.
I've been able to get rid of that, but that's only really recently that I've been able to do that.
Furniture and stuff that we're not using.
I can get rid of.
I've had chairs that I've had for 30 years or more, but I still use them so I haven't gotten rid of them.
It has to become so worn out that I don't want it anymore or it's so out of style, as far as clothing goes, that I don't want it anymore.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
When you were cleaning out during quarantine and stuff, you just mostly got rid of things that were just falling apart, basically?
Interviewee:
No, no, no, no. I got rid of a lot of stuff.
I just looked at stuff and thought, "Well, this is something that I haven't use and we don't need.
I can give it away," typewriters and stuff that there's nothing wrong with it, it's just that I don't need it.
I use a computer and I don't need a typewriter anymore.
I try to think about stuff that maybe somebody else would be able to use, so I could give it away.
Does that makes sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay.
Interviewee:
I try make that like household goods; I don't need three irons.
I don't need two blenders.
I don't need a bread machine.
I don't need all these extra things that I never use.
I was able to give up a lot of that kind of stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That makes sense.
Interviewee:
But this really was just this big, huge revelation that I just had since the quarantine, because before that I was, "No, it's mine.
I'm keeping it."
Interviewer:
What brought you to that epiphany?
