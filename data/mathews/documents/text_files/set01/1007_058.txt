Interviewer:
Okay. So, what does your space look like? Are you able to use every room for its intended purpose or are there some rooms you just can't use at all?
Participant 007:
No, I sit in my living room and sleep in my bedroom, and cook in my kitchen. Use the bathroom. So, those are the rooms that I have. My table is not, I'd love to have it cleaned off and do jigsaw puzzles because I don't sit down at the table and eat. It has my printer on it, and then I have to clean off space so the printer can be used on the rare occasion that I use it. I mean there's just stuff everywhere and it drives me nuts.
Interviewer:
So, would you consider every part of your home to be cluttered?
Participant 007:
Yes, yes.
Interviewer:
And is it things in boxes that's making them cluttered or is it just furniture or books or puzzles?
Participant 007:
Not really furniture so much. It's more stuff on the furniture. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 007:
Stuff. It's just stuff. 
Interviewer:
It's just a collection of miscellaneous items?
Participant 007:
Calling it a collection is a very generous description.
Interviewer:
Okay. Okay, on the flip side, what would you like your home to look like in an ideal world? 
Participant 007:
Oh, I would love it to be neat and tidy, and be able to open the door and invite anyone in instead of having to move stuff off the couch, so that somebody could sit on it. That I'd be able to say, "Oh, come in. Have a seat." I would love to have that. Absolutely love to have it. 
Interviewer:
Okay, and how important is it for to feel at home? How important are your things for you to feel at home? 
Participant 007:
How important are my things...
Interviewer:
Yeah. 
Participant 007:
For me to feel at home? 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 007:
I have no idea how to answer that because there are some thing that if somebody came in and then got rid of them on my behalf, I'd be very grateful and other things, I'd say, "Whew, I don't really want to get rid of that," and there's also things where I go, "Oh, I forgot I had that." "Oh, look at this." When you get to the bottom of a pile, it's like your compass on a mission of discovery. Whoo-hoo!
Interviewer:
Okay, when you think about all your items, which would you say are most important for you and you spend the most time with? 
Participant 007:
I spend the most time with my laptop, actually.
Interviewer:
All right. 
Participant 007:
Yeah, that's the biggie for me.
