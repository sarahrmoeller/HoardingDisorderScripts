Participant:
Well I think I would be upset. Yes, I would be upset, but I don't know for how long. Sometimes I think about things that I got rid of and I mourn for them like “oh I wish I had; god why did we get rid of that?” Especially something that wouldn’t have taken up any space. “Like oh I remember I gave that away!” Um, but that it was finally able to be given away. I don't remember feeling bad about the time later, I think, oh, “if only, if only.”
44:05 Interviewer:
It’s like the reflection about it that makes you upset. 
Participant:
Yeah, when I do my five things I don't, like, the next day go through and see what I got rid of, for example, I got two bags in my bedroom now on the floor and it's a collection of many days of five things, but I know I went and said “you know, what’s in here?” then half the stuff I pull out again. You know, so there’s that as well. 
44:38 Interviewer:
Okay. And the very last question is would you like to change your behavior? 
Participant:
Yes, I would like to change my behavior. Sometimes and maybe actually I can change my behavior on the acquiring side. It’s the acquisition. I’ve trained myself on the acquiring side to not stop and look at the bulging trash can. To not stop at that garage sale. To look away when somebody’s pulling out their stuff. But once it’s in that’s when it stays. That’s the hard behavior. The holding. 
45:27 Interviewer:
And what do you think would be like the biggest benefit to you, changing your behavior like what do you think the most positive impact would be?
Participant:
I think like when I go to someone else's house. Has two things are for a vacation somewhere hotel or something and there’s very few personal things in the minimalist sort of space and it feels so open you know it just feels so open. And wiping down is so easy it’s not like you got to move stuff. You just wipe it down. And that's what would be that would be a psychological lift of lightness and then also a production in time. In work time. 
46:24 Interviewer:
So just like the mental relief added with just like the ease of doing things that should be quick and easy. 
Participant:
Yeah. 
46:36 Interviewer:
