Participant 34:
No. I have a housemate. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 34:
And then sometimes I have his two children each individually living with us in the third bedroom. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you feel that your space would look any different if you didn't have a roommate? 
Participant 34:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
How so? 
Participant 34:
It would be improved. He has adult ADHD, which he says is partly responsible for his apparently not cleaning up after himself and things like that. For him, it's a real effort to just take care of busy household chores. 
Interviewer:
Does he also keep items or is it more so just day to day cleanliness?
Participant 34:
Day to day cleanliness. 
Interviewer:
Okay. That's got to be frustrating [crosstalk 00:18:50] at times. 
Participant 34:
Pardon? 
Interviewer:
That's got to be frustrating at times. 
Participant 34:
Oh yes, yes. Also, doesn't work or pay rent.
Interviewer:
And so whenever you think about the items that you do keep, you mentioned a few qualifiers for what makes them valuable to you, but do you mind going through those again?
Participant 34:
Of what those things are-
Interviewer:
Of what makes the items that you keep valuable to you. 
Participant 34:
I keep documents like diplomas and awards and photographs and art works. I do photography as a hobby, mostly photographs of flowers. And I have papered my bathroom walls and some other walls with some photographs of mine. I will soon make four by six blank note cards with my photographs. 
Interviewer:
Cool. 
Participant 34:
For personal notes, like when I go to the marijuana store or when I go to a restaurant and leave a tip, I often leave a card. 
Interviewer:
That's awesome. 
Participant 34:
So that they have a nice private note with a little bit of eye candy and they can then write whatever they wish to whomever, put it in the envelope that I provide and add a stamp. And a uniformed officer of the government delivers it without reading it to whoever. A handwritten note to your grandma today will make her day today. And she'll probably remember it for years to come. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, my grandmother loved receiving notes. That was something [crosstalk 00:21:04]. Yeah, in the last few years of her life, that was important to her. 
Participant 34:
Right. And the same thing's true for your parents or good friends or politicians you like. 
Interviewer:
Do you happen to-
Participant 34:
Enclose the rent check in the card with a pretty picture on it. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. Do you then keep any notes that you receive from others? 
Participant 34:
Some, but most of them eventually get either put in the file cabinet or lost. And since I'm looking to move in a couple of months, I've got to get busy with tossing things and donating process.
