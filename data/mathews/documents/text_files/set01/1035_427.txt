Participant 035:
As far as valuable financially, for the most part, no. Anything that's financially valuable is in a protective place of its own. Some art glass vases and that sort of thing, I keep in the china cabinet. They're in a place where they're safe. Other things that I value, because of the memories associated with them. A lot of the art that I have on the walls, things like oh, my aunt did this series of watercolors, that sort of thing. 
Interviewer:
Some of it has sentimental value.
Participant 035:
Yeah. Absolutely.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Some of it has monetary value. The stuff that you consider to be monetarily valuable is more put away, and the stuff that you think is more sentimentally valuable is more out?
Participant 035:
Yeah. It's not that the monetarily valuable things are put away, they're just protected a little bit better. Like my crystal and china, and the art glass stuff, they're out on display. The silver, which I value because it was my mother's silver set, and then another thing that was my grandmother's, I keep those put away, because it's so that, to protect it. Yeah. 
Interviewer:
What about-
Participant 035:
In other words, if a service person comes into the house, I don't want them to be aware that-
Interviewer:
You have valuable silver, yeah. 
Participant 035:
... I own ... Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, that makes sense. Just to protect it and keep it out of sight. 
Participant 035:
Right. 
Interviewer:
How about when you're going through your stuff and you're making decisions about when it's time to throw something away, when do you decide to throw stuff away? What is that decision making process like for you?
Participant 035:
Gosh, I haven't made that decision in so long, that's why I've got a problem. No. God. Inertia. It's so weird, I will develop, I'll go okay, here's how I'm going to throw stuff away. This is going to go to such and such place, this goes into the trash, this goes into the recycle, this goes into the next time we have a garage sale shelf in the garage. I'll spend so much time trying to get organized, that actually, carrying out the plan never happens. Or, it'll start, but then I've either made the plan so complicated, or whatever, that I never finish it up. 
Interviewer:
It's not that you never have the-
Participant 035:
It's mostly, it's about, what's the disposition of this stuff. What I've started doing is just randomly, Lord, I'd never use this anymore. Why do I have it here? This happened with the, I have a waffle maker. It was a regular little single purpose waffle maker, and then I went, oh, I sure do like paninis, and I got one of those, you can make paninis on it, you can make waffles, et cetera. I have duplicate things.
