Interviewer (8:18): Okay, so that’s going to conclude our free listing section of the interview. So, the next section is going to more kinda like a general conversation. So, I’m going to ask you questions about, um, your hoarding in particular, your space, like why you value your possessions, and things like that. And again, I just wanna remind you if any of these questions make you uncomfortable you don’t have to answer and you can always ask me to rephrase if something’s confusing or otherwise, you know, you don’t understand something or a part of a question. Alright?
Participant:
Okay.
Interviewer (8:53): Okay so, first off, if you could just describe to me your particular hoarding or clutter problems. Like how long has this been going on and how would you describe it?
Participant:
Um, I would say that I have been strategically accumulating for a number of years. And, it’s… it probably started because I had plenty of space and there wasn’t any need to be getting rid of stuff that might have a purpose later on at some point in time. 
Interviewer (9:31): Mhmm.
Participant:
Um… and I guess eventually if you save enough stuff, you start being, um, challenged for space. Uh… and, when other people elect to share your space with you, that becomes more of an issue. Um…
Interviewer (9:58): Okay, so—
Participant:
And again, uh, I would say that my hoarding is— was, not a big deal to me because I’m an organized hoarder, until someone else joined my household, and their interpretation of organization appeared to be a little different than my interpretation of organization. 
Interviewer (10:33): Right. So, when did this all begin? Can you remember a specific time when you started collecting things?
Participant:
Um, not really.
Interviewer (10:43): Okay, so just kind of like throughout your life?
Participant:
Sure.
Interviewer (10:49): So, you mentioned that when you brought someone else into your household, they kinda had a problem with it. So, I wanna touch a little bit more on that. Have you ever had conflicts with the people that are close to you, like the person you mentioned or maybe even someone like a landlord, or anyone else in your family maybe?
Participant:
I would say that there’s occasionally some conflict between me and my significant other. 
Interviewer (11:13): Okay, and for what reason?
Participant:
Because she is on the other end of the accumulation spectrum, and she likes to have a clean, orderly, uncluttered uh, environment in which to um, exist. Uh, and... she’s continuously cleaning, organizing, and doing things along those lines. So sometimes we are at odds with each other. 
Interviewer (11:48): Right, so—
Participant:
And fortunately, we have space, so she’s been able to, uh, partition things in a manner which allows me to keep my stuff in certain areas as long as I don’t encroach into other areas.
