Participant 1:
Yes. I'll tell you. My sister-in-law and I started in January planning a trip to Italy. So in March we were planning on going in March and boom. COVID hit. So then it was this huge ordeal. We were going to go to several countries and I don't get along with her very well, so we were going to try and do this to mend our relationship or to bond closer. Well, I had no idea what she was like and she turned into a total ass. And ended up just being horrible. It was one of the most horrible experiences. So from January through April or right before my birthday in May, she was hounding me and we had replanned the trip three different times because as time went on, you could see COVID was going on. So we kept having to rebook and rebook and oh my god. It was horrible.
Interviewer:
Absolutely.
Participant 1:
And I basically, I'm cut off from my brother because she's planning with my brother and I'm cut off with her. So it created a huge rift ... which causes me the stress and I'm depressed about it. Yeah.
