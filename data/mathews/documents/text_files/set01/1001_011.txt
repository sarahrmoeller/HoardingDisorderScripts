Participant 1:
Part of working is getting up, getting dressed and going into work. And seeing other people.
Interviewer:
For sure.
Participant 1:
It's part of life.
Interviewer:
Yeah. I agree.
Participant 1:
This is not living.
Interviewer:
I mean, the psychological impact too is very tough for everybody.
Participant 1:
It is. It is.
Interviewer:
Just not being able to see people.
Participant 1:
I mean, hoarders are stuck with their hoarding. You're stuck at home with your ... but I've made trips to the dump and I've made trips to the ... I cook a lot when I go up there and then I have all this stuff I have to throw away, but I don't leave food around. I don't know if there's hoarders that do that. That's gross.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). For sure.
Participant 1:
But no. I'm not like that. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And-
Participant 1:
I just- go ahead.
Interviewer:
Sorry. Okay. I was just moving on to the next question but I wanted to ... 
Participant 1:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
What did you ... Okay.
Participant 1:
Go ahead.
Interviewer:
So how has COVID-19 affected your motivation to seek help for hoarding behaviors specifically?
Participant 1:
It's not one of my priorities.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Participant 1:
Not one of my priorities, but since this came up now, I'll talk to you about it. But no. I'm not ... I don't have the money to go see a therapist and if I were, it wouldn't be about hoarding. It'd be about other things. So ... you know?
Interviewer:
Yeah. For sure. Have you kept in contact with your family and friends during this time?
Participant 1:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. How often?
Participant 1:
Oh, a lot.
Interviewer:
Oh, good.

I have a friend whose house I go over to during the week. And I go over there and work with her and talk, and then we go on hikes together.

Wonderful.
Participant 1:
And when I go up to my house I have a whole group of people I go hiking with.
Interviewer:
Oh, that's great. Uh-huh (affirmative).
Participant 1:
Yeah. And I have groups of people. We have Zoom. We have a Zoom meeting every couple weeks with all my running friends.
Interviewer:
Wow. That's great.
Participant 1:
And so there's a lot of ways that I try to stay healthy socially.
Interviewer:
Wonderful. Yeah.
Participant 1:
Yeah. You have to move.
Interviewer:
Definitely.
Participant 1:
You have to move the body every day.
Interviewer:
Definitely.

Interviewer:
Yeah. I agree completely.
Participant 1:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Sorry. Do you-
Participant 1:
Oh, no.
