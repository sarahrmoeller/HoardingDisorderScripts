Interviewer:
Do you feel, go ahead?
Participant 26:
I guess I'm really not buying very much except for food. I'm not bringing anything new into the house. I pretty much have everything I need and want, so if anything we're thinking ahead to downsizing. 
Interviewer:
So you've done less shopping, you've gone out less, and you've more just kind of stayed home and had more time to organize and keep the house set up the way you'd like it?
Participant 26:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Has COVID-19 effected your physical health at all in this time?
Participant 26:
No, not in a negative way. In fact I've started swimming again.
Interviewer:
Oh, wonderful.
Participant 26:
I haven't swum regularly since before my daughter was born in 1992. But yeah, I mean just sitting around the house all day and not being able to get out and go on vacation, see friends. I'm really feeling the need for more exercise.
Interviewer:
That's wonderful, that's great, I'm glad to hear that. 
Participant 26:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How about in terms of your mental health or your overall wellbeing, do you feel like you've been effected by COVID in that way?
Participant 26:
Well the whole situation really disturbs me. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. 
Participant 26:
And I get very angry.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Participant 26:
When I see what's going on, but if anything it's simplified my life. 
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Participant 26:
A lot of the external pressures are gone. 
Interviewer:
So while you feel stress surrounding news and current events, in terms of your world and your day to day life it's made things simpler and easier, does that sound right?
Participant 26:
Oh yes, very much so. 
Interviewer:
Have there been financial impacts on you or on your family?
Participant 26:
Actually yes, my husband is self employed and he works with corporate executives doing media training. And so that has always been face to face so a lot of that has gone away. 
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Participant 26:
He's doing some things on Zoom, but yeah that's been a concern. 
Interviewer:
So there has been an impact it sounds like, just in terms of his business?
Participant 26:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
And how do you feel that you have been coping since the beginning of these events? What have you found to cope that has been helpful for you?
Participant 26:
You mean with the financial issues?
Interviewer:
Just overall, generally and in terms of stress, in terms of the changes in your life, either financial changes, or?
Participant 26:
I'm just working on living very simply and just remembering to be grateful for what we have and for our health and staying in touch with friends. I love my dog. 
Interviewer:
Dogs are the most important family members during this period. 
Participant 26:
Absolutely. 
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 26:
I'm surprised he didn't come up here and jump on me, he usually does when I'm on the phone.
