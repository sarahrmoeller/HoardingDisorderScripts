Participant 040:
The other thing is books.
I have, at one time in my life, done some Bible studies and there are books.
With the fact that I'm a sewer and there are books.
I'm also interested in music.
I have several hymn books.
A Bible in most every translation you want.
Why I order it, I don't know?
I have the opportunity to do so at a cut rate price.
When I INAUDIBLE issue and that is the interpreter's Bible, Interpreters Study of the Bible, something like that.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Participant 040:
It's a 16 volume set, which I can hardly lift, because there must be 3,000 pages in some of those books.
It's still there and I've used it several times.
It's written on a level my brain does not absorb any longer.
I need to find someone to give them to.
That would clear up 24, 30 inches of space.
Interviewer:
A good amount of space.
Participant 040:
One thing I need to do, I don't talk that much.
Just get some water.
Interviewer:
I'll let you get some water and then we can get to the first prompt.
Participant 040:
Okay.
It's usually handy.
Interviewer:
Okay.
We'll go ahead and move on to some other questions.
These ones won't be the list ones.
And so for some questions, they may not really feel like they apply to you or they might be really short answers.
Some of them might be longer, and that's fine.
You've already kind of explained some of the different clutter problems, so things with fabric.
I know we talked about some things with books, with tools and not putting those away, that not everything has a place.
Was there anything else you wanted to add to that?
Participant 040:
What causes the clutter.
Interviewer:
I'm sorry.
I wasn't very clear.
As far as what your clutter, excuse me, what your clutter problems are like.
I know, again, you described some things with fabric and-
Participant 040:
Well, yeah.
Interviewer:
Is there anything else?
Participant 040:
They're in boxes, but the boxes are forcing me out.
I can't seem to make decisions.
Decisions are difficult.
Because I know I won't use this again, probably, probably.
Interviewer:
And you said that this-
Participant 040:
But just in case, I will keep it.
Interviewer:
And you said this has been going on at least since high school.
Do you know if it started earlier than that?
Participant 040:
Let's see.
It was in what they all called junior high back then.
I know back in junior high I wouldn't put things away necessarily.
My sister is much neater than I am.
And we actually literally put a piece of tape down the center of our room, and I was not to have anything that crossed that tape.
So this is, let's see, ninth grade, eighth grade.
Interviewer:
Eighth grade, okay.
How severe would you say that your clutter problems are now?
Participant 040:
How what?
