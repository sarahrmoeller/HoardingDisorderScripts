Interviewer:
Okay. Are there areas of your home that you would consider cluttered? What makes them cluttered?
Participant 005:
Yes. My office is cluttered because of papers and too much stuff. It kind of looks organized sometimes because I've got things in boxes and labeled boxes. You know, it would just be great if I didn't have them and I don't really think I need them all. My dining room, my prior house I had a whole different style of house so I have my dining room is filled with all of the old furniture that I need to sell still as well as my dining room furniture that I have now and that's true in several rooms.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 005:
Yeah. That's probably the best description.
Interviewer:
Are there parts of your home that you don't use or are they all inaccessible?
Participant 005:
My garage, I can't ... but all the rooms inside the house are accessible.
Interviewer:
Okay. What kind of things do you think your garage is filled with? What's the main thing you think?
Participant 005:
Boxes of stuff from my old house that have been in storage for two and a half years. I haven't even seen them to know what's in there. But I'm tired of paying storage and we just moved all the boxes into the garage.
Interviewer:
Yeah. That makes sense.
Participant 005:
We're slowly going through them.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. My next question is when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?
Participant 005:
Multiple things. I mean, there's some because they're irreplaceable, pieces of art, for instance. Some are because of who they used to belong to, my mom, my dad, things that my ... Memories, things that my kids have made. Photographs are valuable to me. Then there's monetary value, jewelry and some artwork is valuable, specifically, because it's financial value. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. What would you say is the most precious item in your house?
Participant 005:
Photo albums. Actually, they're not in my house right now because we had to evacuate. Now they're in my office. But my photo albums.
Interviewer:
Oh, okay. When it comes to throwing something away, what is trash for you? What do you usually discard?
Participant 005:
Such a general question. I have recently been getting rid of a lot of clothing. What do I discard? Stuff that I don't think I will ever need.
Interviewer:
Okay. If you had to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?
Participant 005:
Well, that's kind of what we just went through in deciding what to actually [inaudible 00:17:57]. Those things that I felt ... A photograph wasn't going to be enough and that were truly just irreplaceable. Photo albums, for instance. You know, the actual photo albums that aren't digital. Some of the artwork and important papers, passports and things.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Does your clutter upset you in any way or do you think it's getting in the way of your daily life?
