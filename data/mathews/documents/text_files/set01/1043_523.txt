Interviewer:
Okay. The interview is going to be broken up into two different sections. The first section being where we're going to make some lists. Then the second portion of the interview will just be us having more a free flowing conversation with some open-ended questions.
Participant 043:
Okay.
Interviewer:
As you know, the study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question that I want to ask you is what term you'd prefer me to use when we're talking about our difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 043:
I didn't understand that. I have OCD and I also have hoarding disorder but I don't have ... When you see like there used to be shows on where they would go into people's places and clean it up, I'm not like that. I don't have dirt everywhere but it's just a lot of papers that I collect.
Interviewer:
Okay. Basically, my question is asking are you okay with the term hoarding? Do you prefer difficulty with clutter? What is your preferred term?
Participant 043:
Probably difficulties with clutter.
Interviewer:
Okay. Great. Those were great lists. That's it for our list making section. Now we're going to move onto the discussion section of the interview. The first question is can you please describe your difficulties with clutter and how long has this been going on?
Participant 043:
I'm not sure how long it's been going on. Probably at least 12 years. What was the other part of the question?
Interviewer:
Just describing generally your difficulties with clutter. Maybe what that entails for you.
Participant 043:
Basically, it's things laying around, because I haven't ... Part of my OCD is I'm very detail-oriented so with papers I want to file them in safe places and I don't get around to it so that's why it's laying around. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. You would say, for you, it's really holding onto papers and documents that you desire to have organized but it just becomes difficult and maybe overwhelming?
Participant 043:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you believe your behavior is a problem?
Participant 043:
Yes.
Interviewer:
How severe would you say this behavior is?
Participant 043:
At this point, it's severe but it's not as severe as it had been.
Interviewer:
Okay. You feel like it's improved over time?
Participant 043:
Yeah. I hired someone who's a professional organizer who would come in for a few hours every week and so we had got through quite a bit.
Interviewer:
Okay. You've had a professional organizer come. What about have you ever gone to a different type of professional for help with this behavior? Like a therapist?
Participant 043:
Yes. I've talked to my counselor about it and my psychiatrist who diagnosed it. 
Interviewer:
Okay. How did you find the counselor or the psychiatrist?
