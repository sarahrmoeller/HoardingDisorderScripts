Interviewer:
Do you feel like, when you think about your ideal living space and what would be comfortable for you to live in, do you feel like having all of your items with you will make you more comfortable in that space?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Which of the things that you... When you think about all of the stuff, what sorts of items do you think are the most important to you?
Participant 018:
Well, the older letters and photos.
Interviewer:
So, older items that are linked to your family's history, it sounds like those are the most important ones.
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
What are the things that you spend the most time with? So, when you're at home, which items do you tend to use or take out or look at the most?
Participant 018:
I've been taking out the family items and digitizing, occasionally posting something, and then I'm also going through some discs and things to digitize that I don't need to keep the original of.
Interviewer:
So, you're kind of working through the process of putting all of the most important things, getting a digital form of them, and then some of those things you don't need to save the original because you have a digital copy?
Participant 018:
Right, things that are new that aren't valuable.
Interviewer:
So, once you've digitized new things, you can discard them?
Participant 018:
Yes.
Interviewer:
You've talked several times about the fact that things get cluttered. I guess I'm wondering, do you feel that your space is cluttered now?
Participant 018:
Yes.
Interviewer:
What makes a space cluttered for you? When you say that something is cluttered, does that mean that the items are out? What distinguishes clutter?
Participant 018:
Well, I'll kind of stack up toward the door, and there isn't really... There are things on the floor, so there isn't space to vacuum or anything.
Interviewer:
So, that sense of things being stacked up and preventing you from being able to vacuum the floor is what makes clutter clutter?
Participant 018:
Well, there's things on the floor...
Interviewer:
So, things on the floor, things that are not organized?
Participant 018:
... that block the path a little bit.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, things that are starting to block the path in and out of the door, that's cluttering?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Are there parts of your apartment that you're not able to use or have access to?
Participant 018:
No. I have access to the bathroom and kitchen and bed.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, you're able to sleep in your bed and use your bathroom and shower, and use the kitchen without the clutter getting in the way?
Participant 018:
Right.
