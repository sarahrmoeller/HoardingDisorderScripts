Interviewer:
Sure, so she's just a little scattered in her personality?
Interviewee6:
Yeah, very much so.
But she did graduate from law school and she was a lawyer.
Interviewer:
Yeah I mean, intelligent family for sure, she definitely has no problem dealing with being scattered.
So have you ever heard about hoarding disorder anywhere or gotten information about it?
What's your main source of information about the existence of this?
Is it your personal experience with your grandmother?
Or have you ever read about it or seen anything about it anywhere?
Interviewee6:
Yeah, I would say my earliest experience was my grandmother, but over the years I've seen lots of stuff about it in different places.
Interviewer:
So I'm going to read you a couple of vignettes here and then we're going to close out the section of the interview where we're going to talk about hoarding disorder and we're going to get back to talking about your life.
Interviewee6:
Okay.
Interviewer:
And again, this is just to try to understand the way people who have problems with clutter but maybe don't have hoarding disorder understand the disorder and understand what it is and what it isn't.
Interviewee6:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So I'll read you a little vignette about a person and then you can tell me if you think that this person has hoarding disorder or maybe just has clutter problems or maybe doesn't even have clutter problems, it's up to you.
Interviewee6:
Okay.
Interviewer:
And we can talk about why they may or may not have the disorder.
Interviewee6:
Okay.
Interviewer:
So the first is, let's imagine John.
He has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in and he's worried that he might get rid of a box that he'll need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in the other rooms, his house is not always organized but it's usually not cluttered.
Occasionally it's difficult for John to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens he is sometimes but rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.
Does this sound like a person who has hoarding disorder to you?
Interviewee6:
No. Interviewer:
And why not?
Interviewee6:
Because the boxes are contained in one area.
And you said that his house is, I think you said it's not always organized but it's not cluttered.
Interviewer:
So he doesn't have hoarding disorder?
Interviewee6:
No. Interviewer:
Because his house is really not that effected?
Interviewee6:
Right, and also he's saving specific items for a reason, I do that too.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Do you think he should try to change his behavior or do you think that he should work on this problem?
