Interviewee:
Well, there may be having one of something and enjoying that, rather than feeling like you had to have the whole set, all of them in that grouping.
Or people who would make do with an acrylic template used for cutting with a rotary cutter.
They would not rush out the purchase it.
I think long and hard, and then eventually get it.
Might as well just get it in the first place.
Someone's without a hoarding problem would not bother with it because I wouldn't do it now necessarily, but I might need it someday.
Interviewer:
So someone without hoarding disorder might not buy something that they won't need for a while?
Interviewee:
Or they won't be at all.
They'd just make do around it.
But this thing that I would purchase would be very useful.
If they were going to do something that's in touch, and they would get it.
I was learning how to crack pistachios, how to get pistachios out of the shell, and I looked at them, and I thought, "Oh, those look like coquina shells.
They would make really nice necklaces."
My husband says, "No, you don't."
And I said, "Well, I wasn't going to save them, truly, but they would make nice necklaces."
Pistachio shells.
That would be one difference.
They wouldn't even think of that.
It wouldn't even cross their minds.
That's trash.
It goes there.
It's oceans of future possibilities that make me get something.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So someone with maybe normal saving behavior may say, "This is trash.
I'm going to throw this away," but someone with hoarding disorder may say, "I could use that for something"?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
It sounds like you've done some research kind of on hoarding disorder before.
Where do you get information about hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Where do I get information?
Interviewer:
Yes, ma'am.
Interviewee:
Mostly books.
Interviewer:
Mostly books.
Okay.
Interviewee:
There's that Trash to Treasure.
Let's see.
Not Tethered to a Cord.
Interviewer:
So some books like Trash to Treasure, Not Tethered to a Cord?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
I thought they were right there.
Interviewer:
Have you ever-
Interviewee:
I thought I had the books right there in one spot, but they must be in a different spot.
Anyway, let's see.
I've done three or four books.
Shadows I cannot bring out of my brain.
Interviewer:
That's okay.
Did you find that the-
Interviewee:
But each one has a certain slant to it.
A different idea.
And I think, "Oh, that makes sense."
Interviewer:
Did you think that they were helpful or informative?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Yes.
Every book that I read had a different take on it about why do you have problems, and I think, "Oh, yeah," but I don't know anything.
I just read the book.
I like books.
Interviewer:
Have you heard of hoarding disorder in any other context?
