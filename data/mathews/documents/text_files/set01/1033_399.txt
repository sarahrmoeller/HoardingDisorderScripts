Participant 33:
I am not sure. I'm not sure where the line draws except I think... I imagine people with collections, that's actually where I would like to be. I'd like to have them organized. I'd like to be able to put my hands on exactly what I want when I want it. I'd like things to be labeled so that my kids know where they came from and what their historic significance is. That's what I think a collector really is, and that's what I really hope to do with the stuff that I have, that it becomes not just an item, but something that has a story with it. 
I think the way things are now that things are very disorganized, that if you asked me to get one single particular thing, I would have to open five different boxes to figure out which one it was in. If I needed to find information on a piece of paper, I would have to shuffle through a stack of papers to get to it. I think the organization is key, and probably there's some quantity, although I don't know how I would quantify that too. I mean if you want to have one of every kind of something, that's collecting, but when you have to have every single one of something, then that's hoarding, I guess. 
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah, quantity and then the organization sound like to the the main difference there. 
Participant 33:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Interviewer:
I know that you mentioned earlier that you've never been diagnosed with something like hoarding disorder, but I think you said that you would probably meet the criteria for the diagnosis. 
Participant 33:
I don't know what the definition is exactly. I just feel like I'm different from other people in that respect, though. If other people keep things [inaudible 00:35:59] than I do, they must be doing a very good job of hiding it because I don't know how to describe it, but I feel... I mean, as I said, my husband and his family, they don't do things [inaudible 00:36:13]. They don't keep things like that. They clear things out regularly and routinely. 
Interviewer:
Gotcha. 
Participant 33:
So yeah, I don't know if I would probably be diagnosed with something or not, but I feel like I'm a bit different from normal people in the regard of the amount of stuff I keep. 
Interviewer:
Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder or clutter problems without being in their home? 
Participant 33:
I don't think so. 
Interviewer:
Some people have thoughts on that, and some people say that probably the only way to do that is in their homes. That's why we ask that. Have you ever tried to get information about hoarding disorder or clutter problems in general?
