Participant 46:
I was going to say, and for her, neatly organized wasn't hoarding.
Disarray was.
So go ahead.
Have you what?
Interviewer:
You mentioned that your co-worker has some issues with hoarding and you helped her.
Have you sought any advice or assistance from her to help you de-clutter as well?
Participant 46:
No, because I have to tell you, she is in worse condition than I am, because she is paying $250 a month for storage units housing trash.
I tried to convince her, I said, I told her, "You have spent close to $18,000 almost 10 years hoarding trash."
There's only trash in those storage lockers, and I mean literally trash.
She just can't let it go.
Interviewer:
Have you ever bought storage lockers?
Participant 46:
Have I ever what?
Interviewer:
Do you have or have you ever purchased storage lockers outside of your home?
Participant 46:
No, no. I just purchased a bigger house.
See I knew I could own it, so.
But she can't afford a house, so she probably get storage lockers.
Interviewer:
So I know that you mentioned learning a lot about hoarding disorder from the TV shows, and you enjoy those.
Are there other sources that you get information about?
Participant 46:
Yes, the famous lady Maria Condo, the one who's in...
Or organized.
And then there's the Swedish Desks book.
It's actually, I read a lot of books, magazines, non-fiction.
They tend to have a lot of how to approach things without the full-blown Monty, someone coming in and dumping on me.
So the Swedish desk cleaning was very good.
The Maria Condo gave me some ideas.
Of course, not 100% on either one of those.
And just small little things, and you do them for weeks at a time.
They become ingrained then.
Interviewer:
How do you, when you hear the words hoarding disorder, how does that make you feel?
Participant 46:
Well I don't feel badly, because I know I have it.
I just don't admit it to people.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE, okay.
I'm just looking over the questions.
I think we have covered a lot of it.
Thank you so much for agreeing to do this.
Participant 46:
Oh yeah, thank you.
It was like a therapy session, I'm telling you.
Interviewer:
Good.
Participant 46:
It makes me re-think of this.
I don't know that I can go home and throw that spice jar away, but I'll have to think about the common sense of this.
I can always get another one, but who knows.
I'll have to think about this.
Interviewer:
And talking about-
Participant 46:
Yeah, I appreciate you-
Interviewer:
... this is helpful.
Participant 46:
Yes, I appreciate you calling.
That's how I'm doing it for.
If it's a chemical imbalance, if it's a mental imbalance, I think it's a combo of everything.
That's why I said, no-
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Before you go, is it okay, may I ask you your demographics?
