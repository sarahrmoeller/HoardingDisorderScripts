Before we actually begin the more interview part of this, what is your preferred term that we use when we're talking about your difficulties discarding clutter?
Interviewee:
Wait, I'm sorry.
You cut again.
It keeps doing that.
Could you try it again please?
Interviewer:
Yes, of course.
We just wanted to know what term you would prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Interviewee:
Hoarder, hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Junk packer.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well, some people have a preference, so we just like to ask.
Interviewee:
Yeah, no. What's wrong with you?
No. Interviewer:
All right.
That completes the free listing section.
This next section is going to be more conversational style.
It's just separated into five different topics.
This first topic is me discussing behavior and treatment seeking.
If you could please describe your hoarding problems and how long have they been going on?
Interviewee:
My whole life?
No. Probably maybe 20 years, 25 years.
Actually, I've really made these great strides lately, but just to hold stuff that I might need in the future or that I did pay too much for.
I didn't want to get rid of it.
I grew up without a whole lot so I think every time I buy something, it was a promise to myself.
I felt if I didn't finish a task or complete a project that I bought something for, I would keep it because it was a promise.
Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How severe would you say your behavior is now?
Interviewee:
Right now?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewee:
I'm really proud of myself right now because of coronavirus.
I couldn't go anywhere, so I've been doing it less.
Probably now it is moderate.
It was pretty severe up until about three months ago, not horrible but bad.
Does that makes sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay.
