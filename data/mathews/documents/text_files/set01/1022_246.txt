Interviewer:
Okay. Then there are going to be three parts to this interview.
The first part is just basic questions.
The first one is, what was your sex assigned at birth?
Male, female or intersex?

I'm sorry you cut out for a second there.
Could you say that again?
Interviewer:
Yeah, of course.
What was your sex assigned at birth?

Then what is your highest degree or level of education that you've completed?
Participant 022:

Okay.
Then which geographic region best describes where you live in the US: Northeast Midwest, South or West?
Participant 022:

Interviewer:
Okay, thank you.
Before we actually begin the more interview part of this, what is your preferred term that we use when we're talking about your difficulties discarding clutter?
Participant 022:
Wait, I'm sorry.
You cut again.
It keeps doing that.
Could you try it again please?
Interviewer:
Yes, of course.
We just wanted to know what term you would prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 022:
Hoarder, hoarding.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 022:
Yeah.
Junk packer.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well, some people have a preference, so we just like to ask.
Participant 022:
Yeah, no. What's wrong with you?
No. Interviewer:
All right.
That completes the free listing section.
This next section is going to be more conversational style.
It's just separated into five different topics.
This first topic is me discussing behavior and treatment seeking.
If you could please describe your hoarding problems and how long have they been going on?
Participant 022:
My whole life?
No. Probably maybe 20 years, 25 years.
Actually, I've really made these great strides lately, but just to hold stuff that I might need in the future or that I did pay too much for.
I didn't want to get rid of it.
I grew up without a whole lot so I think every time I buy something, it was a promise to myself.
I felt if I didn't finish a task or complete a project that I bought something for, I would keep it because it was a promise.
Does that make sense?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 022:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How severe would you say your behavior is now?
Participant 022:
Right now?
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 022:
I'm really proud of myself right now because of coronavirus.
I couldn't go anywhere, so I've been doing it less.
Probably now it is moderate.
It was pretty severe up until about three months ago, not horrible but bad.
Does that makes sense?
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay.
