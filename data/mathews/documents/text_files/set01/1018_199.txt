Interviewer:
That makes sense.
You might still try to resell some of the things that you already have because you already have them, but you're not trying to go out and find new things to sell them.
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Well, I really appreciate your time.
That was the questions that I have for you-
Participant 1:
What is your gender?
Participant 018:
Male.
Participant 1:
And that's your sex assigned at birth?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Participant 1:
What is your race or ethnicity?
Participant 018:
Caucasian.
Participant 1:
Okay.
Hold on one second.
Okay.
Do you mind giving me your household income?
It can be an approximate value.
Participant 018:
Oh, well now I left my job a couple months ago.
So I don't currently have income.
Participant 1:
Okay.
And in terms of the geographic region, I think you said you're in the Northeast?
Participant 018:
Well, Kentucky is kind of between South and Midwest.
Participant 1:
Okay.
So we'll put you in the South.
Participant 018:
South.
Participant 1:
Yeah, Kentucky.
It depends, I guess.
It's one of those States that could be either.
Okay, well let me get your address or if you would like, you can email it to me and then I'll just send it right on over.
Is that better?
Participant 018:
Oh, okay.
Participant 1:
You're so up on email, that might be the easiest way to do it.
