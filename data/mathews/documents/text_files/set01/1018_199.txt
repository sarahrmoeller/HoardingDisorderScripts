Interviewer:
That makes sense.
You might still try to resell some of the things that you already have because you already have them, but you're not trying to go out and find new things to sell them.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Well, I really appreciate your time.
That was the questions that I have for you-
Interviewee:
What is your gender?
Interviewee:
Male.
Interviewee:
And that's your sex assigned at birth?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
What is your race or ethnicity?
Interviewee:
Caucasian.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Hold on one second.
Okay.
Do you mind giving me your household income?
It can be an approximate value.
Interviewee:
Oh, well now I left my job a couple months ago.
So I don't currently have income.
Interviewee:
Okay.
And in terms of the geographic region, I think you said you're in the Northeast?
Interviewee:
Well, Kentucky is kind of between South and Midwest.
Interviewee:
Okay.
So we'll put you in the South.
Interviewee:
South.
Interviewee:
Yeah, Kentucky.
It depends, I guess.
It's one of those States that could be either.
Okay, well let me get your address or if you would like, you can email it to me and then I'll just send it right on over.
Is that better?
Interviewee:
Oh, okay.
Interviewee:
You're so up on email, that might be the easiest way to do it.
