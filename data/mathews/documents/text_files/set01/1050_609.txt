Participant 50:
And so just trying to find stuff that made you feel confident and going into that situation. And then when the things stopped my habit of finding things to be an armor didn't stop. And then I had a hysterectomy and that hit me pretty hard and that's when it really began to peak and become unbelievable to the point where I didn't want people to come in, where I spent a lot of time sleeping and just basically that's all I did at the house. And it's been really tough with the virus because I haven't been able to just get out of the mess. I'm sort of stuck here in it.
Interviewer:
I totally understand. So it sounds like it started early, but it was kind of controlled when you were living with your mother and you had developed the habit of acquiring things in the context of kind of needing them to feel good about yourself socially and then that stuck around for your whole life. And then as you've gotten kind of, as things have happened which have caused you to be depressed, it has kind of worse and worse and now unfortunately we're all kind of stuck at home. So you're feeling very trapped in your space right now. Does that sound right?
Participant 50:
Yes.
Interviewer:
How bad is the behavior now? What is your opinion about how severe it is at the moment?
Participant 50:
My opinion of it is at the moment that I live in constant fear of having to open my door and because I last lost my condominium because of the depression. And I would even say a little bit of a hoarder, but I think it was more of the depression. And so now that I live in an apartment, it's that fear of the owners coming in and possibly kicking me out because of these things and stuff. Yeah. So, that's a big fear.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So you'd say it's pretty severe now relative to how it's been in the past?
Participant 50:
Yes, I think it's severe. It's not like some of the things that I see on TV where there's rotting food or anything, but there's clothes everywhere.
Interviewer:
When you say you lost your condominium because of your depression, you mean because of financial issues related to the depression?
Participant 50:
Yeah. So I think financial issues and then just my ability to get things organized, maybe not realizing, "Oh yeah, I didn't pay that." Or "Oh yeah, I got to do that."
Interviewer:
So just keeping check of it.
Participant 50:
Yeah, because it was just basically trying to survive and not do harm to the house.
Interviewer:
Have you ever kind of gone to seek help to change this behavior either from a, like a counselor or a psychologist, psychiatrist or an organizer?
