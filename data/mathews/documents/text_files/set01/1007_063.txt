Then, when you win something, it goes clink, clink, clink, and I would take anything that came out; I would put it in my right hand pocket, and when I got to the end of the five dollar roll of quarters, I had this urge to go into the pocket that had the things that came out and start spending that, and I said, "No, that's stupid," even though it was something I could afford, but I just got that urge. I realized it's too easy to get hooked on that.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewee:
And what really concerns me is that, nowadays ... Years, what, six or seven years ago, I would walk one of these walks. It was an old timer's walk and it was held and registered in a casino that was closed in Saratoga Springs, New York, and we walked through it, and they were just like computers, and I don't even know how. There's no level to pull, so you didn't even have the satisfaction of the clinking and the action, and I guess you, what, put a credit card in and keep pressing a button? It feels so very, very dangerous. I truly don't know how to interact with the, all I can think is one-armed bandit because I can't remember the ... There's a specific term for them, but ones where they have different figures on the three ...
Interviewer:
The slot machines.
Interviewee:
Slot machines. Yes! Thank you. Thank you. It just seems to me that's very dangerous, so to sit there just to push a button. At least when you pull down a level and you, physically, put the quarter in and you pull down the lever, you are aware of what you are doing. Yeah, no, but I can see how it can be an addicting kind of activity.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewee:
So, I stay away from it because I'm an ex-smoker. I have an addictive personality, so I have to stay away from that kind of thing because I can see that it can become too enjoyable. Same with online shopping. You have to be hyper aware of what you're doing and why. I'm a salesperson. "Whew, there's a sale. Let me go," and look at the sale. I'm just babbling. I'm sorry.
Interviewer:
No, you're good. Basically, you've just been trying to really watch your shopping and your buying habits during COVID because it's really easy to online shop?
Interviewee:
Exactly. Exactly, and I can get drawn in by a sale. We're having a sale and 30% off, whew. I have to tell me, "You don't need that." "You have a jacket for fall and a coat for winter. You don't need to go to the LL Bean sale and try to get some stuff." Yeah, I fall for the, "get it before it's too late. Get it now while we still have supplies."
Interviewer:
Yeah, it's very tempting.
