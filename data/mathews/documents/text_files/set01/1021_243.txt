Participant 021:
Oh, yeah. It's interesting to see when the therapist tries to determine why they're hoarding, and I try to see if any of that relates to me, because a lot of times they bring up the self-esteem, they bring up childhood experiences, and that seems to be the root for some people. 
Interviewer:
You mentioned earlier that you think that your behavior started in the twenties. After watching that show, do you think there's any reason that you think it started in the twenties... or in your twenties?
Participant 021:
Well, yeah, I think there's a number of reasons. I came from a totally dysfunctional family, and there was a period there that when I left home... I left home at a pretty early age. I spent quite a number of years doing some pretty serious drinking, and I think I was covering things up, and so I can look back in my life, and I could say, well, pretty much from the get-go, it was pretty unfulfilling. My parents got divorced. I got sent away to an all boys school when I was in the ninth grade along with my brother. So I think that my background has quite a bit to do with it, with sort of setting the self-esteem, and once that is set, I think that's sort of what leads to the hoarding. Because I've seen it on the show, where people that build walls by hoarding and they try to increase their self-esteem by hoarding things and think that they're valuable. I don't know if that applies to me, but I just wonder about it sometimes. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Thank you for sharing that. The next part is talking about the stress. I think we touched this briefly, but does your behavior upset you a lot, and do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant 021:
No, I don't think it gets in the way of my daily life other than the frustrating me when I'm looking for something and can't find it. I've mellowed out over... through the years, because if I can't find something... For instance, I had some chainsaws, and I needed to change the blade on one of them, and I knew I had one, because I remember seeing it, but I couldn't remember where it was, and I knew I had it, and I was frustrated because I didn't want to go out and buy a new one because I knew I had a new one still in the package somewhere. That used to really, really frustrate me, because I would spend hours looking for it and I couldn't find it.
