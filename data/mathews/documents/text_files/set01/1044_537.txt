Interviewee44:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer:
And if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
What would be your process of choosing between things?
Interviewee44:
Hopefully the biggest items first.
Interviewer:
So, you think you would start from big to small, so some bigger furniture pieces and go from there?
Or bigger boxes?
Interviewee44:
Bigger boxes.
Interviewer:
Bigger boxes, yeah.
Okay.
And what's trash for you and how do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Interviewee44:
That's difficult.
When the dogs chewed it to oblivion.
I have a hard time throwing things away.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So, when it's unusable to the point where it's chewed up by the dog.
What else would be trash?
Interviewee44:
I might figure out that I have way too many plastic bags.
I might throw one away and then next week I'm going to need one just that size and it's not there.
So, I won't do that again.
Interviewer:
Yeah, so you hold on to those things that might be trash but you feel you might also need it in the future.
Interviewee44:
Yeah, and if I was organized, which is never going to happen, and knew where everything was, I might know when I had too much of something.
Interviewer:
Right.
So, thinking about what do you think are the most important differences between saving or collecting and hoarding?
Interviewee44:
Well, the mess is the hoarding.
Saving and collecting, it should be organized where you know what you've got and you know where to find it.
And you know who could use it better than you and that sort of thing.
Interviewer:
Okay, so when it becomes just a mess and things are piling up, that would be hoarding.
But if it's organized and kept in the place it needs to be, that could be considered saving or collecting.
Interviewee44:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And what does hoarding disorder look like and how is that same or different from your behavior?
Interviewee44:
Let's see, I like to blame it on not having the energy to take care of it.
Interviewer:
What would you say hoarding disorder looks like?
Interviewee44:
Messy, dangerous, wasteful.
Interviewer:
And would you say that's the same or different from your behavior?
Interviewee44:
That's not nice.
It's certainly there, yes.
Interviewer:
I understand.
Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
I know you mentioned messy house.
But is there a way to tell someone if they have hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Interviewee44:
I don't know.
I would think so, but I could be wrong.
I don't know.
Interviewer:
Yeah, that's okay.
And where you do you get information about hoarding disorder?
Where have you heard of it before?
Interviewee44:
On television of course, my husband turned it on all the time.
Interviewer:
So, yeah-
