Participant 007:
Who needs it, really? But, I couldn't bring myself to throw it away. 
Interviewer:
What would happen if you lost it or it accidentally got thrown away? 
Participant 007:
Oh, I'd be very upset with myself. What can you say? That's just ...
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Another version of this question is, if you had to choose between your items, how would you make that decision? How would you choose? 
Participant 007:
I don't know. I have no idea. Honestly, have not a clue how I would do that.
Interviewer:
Okay. That's a fine response. I mean, it'd be a very difficult decision to make. 
Participant 007:
Yeah, yeah. Again, if you have to make it, you have to make it, but it'd certainly not be an easy thing if you have to.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 007:
Yeah, you'd have to do it and it's just, again, it's a matter of the feelings of guilt, or maybe getting rid of something that you should've held on to or that you should've appreciated more than you did.
Interviewer:
That's a good point. Okay. You mentioned that your behavior does upset you a bit, do you think it gets in the way of your daily life? 
Participant 007:
Hard to say, but what's gotten in the way of my daily life is the whole spinal stenosis thing and, frankly, my inability to get around like I used to. I used to take ... And, of course, coronavirus, because the gym that I go to that is part of my healthcare. 
Interviewer:
Therapy? 
Participant 007:
Well, no, the Medicare insurance I've got includes membership in a really good, local gym.
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 007:
With coronavirus, they're closed. So, I can't do that. So, that has, frankly, interfered with my ability to feel like I'm staying in shape and stay in touch. I used to take Thai chi, very intensive Thai chi, and I can't take that right now because I can't stand long enough to do even a single part of the form. 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 007:
That's very frustrating. There's more than just the clutter going on here. It's also my current physical limitations. It's extremely frustrating.
Interviewer:
So, you would say more that, it is, now, your health has impacted how you get around your house?
Participant 007:
Exactly.
Interviewer:
So, it's become more of a burden on you?
Participant 007:
Yes, exactly. 
Interviewer:
It's more noticeable that there's, oh, this is actually a more difficult way to live because of your current situation?
Participant 007:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. You touched a little bit about how COVID's impacted your life, we actually have a set of questions that's, specifically, about COVID. You mentioned that you can no longer go to the gym and that you've had the surgery. You said in June, right?
Participant 007:
June, yes.
