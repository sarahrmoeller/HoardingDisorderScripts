Interviewee:
Who needs it, really? But, I couldn't bring myself to throw it away.
Interviewer:
What would happen if you lost it or it accidentally got thrown away?
Interviewee:
Oh, I'd be very upset with myself. What can you say? That's just ...
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm . Another version of this question is, if you had to choose between your items, how would you make that decision? How would you choose?
Interviewee:
I don't know. I have no idea. Honestly, have not a clue how I would do that.
Interviewer:
Okay. That's a fine response. I mean, it'd be a very difficult decision to make.
Interviewee:
Yeah, yeah. Again, if you have to make it, you have to make it, but it'd certainly not be an easy thing if you have to.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Yeah, you'd have to do it and it's just, again, it's a matter of the feelings of guilt, or maybe getting rid of something that you should've held on to or that you should've appreciated more than you did.
Interviewer:
That's a good point. Okay. You mentioned that your behavior does upset you a bit, do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Interviewee:
Hard to say, but what's gotten in the way of my daily life is the whole spinal stenosis thing and, frankly, my inability to get around like I used to. I used to take ... And, of course, coronavirus, because the gym that I go to that is part of my healthcare.
Interviewer:
Therapy?
Interviewee:
Well, no, the Medicare insurance I've got includes membership in a really good, local gym.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
With coronavirus, they're closed. So, I can't do that. So, that has, frankly, interfered with my ability to feel like I'm staying in shape and stay in touch. I used to take Thai chi, very intensive Thai chi, and I can't take that right now because I can't stand long enough to do even a single part of the form.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
That's very frustrating. There's more than just the clutter going on here. It's also my current physical limitations. It's extremely frustrating.
Interviewer:
So, you would say more that, it is, now, your health has impacted how you get around your house?
Interviewee:
Exactly.
Interviewer:
So, it's become more of a burden on you?
Interviewee:
Yes, exactly.
Interviewer:
It's more noticeable that there's, oh, this is actually a more difficult way to live because of your current situation?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. You touched a little bit about how COVID's impacted your life, we actually have a set of questions that's, specifically, about COVID. You mentioned that you can no longer go to the gym and that you've had the surgery. You said in June, right?
Interviewee:
June, yes.
