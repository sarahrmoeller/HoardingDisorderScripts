Participant 040:
I'll take a good clean mud to that.
Interviewer:
Well, I'm sorry to hear that that happened to your house.
So it sounds like that silk that you were holding in your hand, you said was your most precious item?
Participant 040:
Well, it was then.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 040:
Because she got married eight months later, seven months later.
And I didn't want to find it again.
I finally decided what I wanted to make.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Participant 040:
But as far as what I couldn't-
PART 3 OF 4 ENDS
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Participant 040:
As far as what I couldn't throw, my most precious ... I don't know what.
There's nothing that stands out as my most precious item.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Participant 040:
I don't know.
Maybe people can because in and of themselves, I don't own really anything that has intrinsic value.
Interviewer:
Okay, but it sounds like that that silk was valuable at the time because you're going to use it for your daughter's wedding, right?
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I found my hips are larger than my top and because of that, I need plenty of room in the skirt.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Participant 040:
You try on these slender dresses, it doesn't work.
So I was going to make mine, and I finally decided on what I was going to do with it.
I tried on many a dresses, and it just wasn't happening.
So, I made my own, and that worked.
This is quite an aside, but someone came up to me and said, "Oh, I see you decided to buy your outfit.
You're mother of the bride after all."
Oh, what a compliment.
But that's eight years ago.
10, 13.
I don't know.
Long time.
Interviewer:
It had been a while ago.
Okay.
If you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
So if you had to choose between keeping something and throwing something away, I guess, between a few different things, what would be the criteria for choosing what would stay and what would go?
Participant 040:
I suppose whether it was relatively, immediately useful.
Interviewer:
If it was immediately useful?
Participant 040:
I don't mean instant, but within several weeks.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Something that you would use within several weeks?
Participant 040:
Yes.
Interviewer:
What would you say are the most important differences between what would be considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Participant 040:
A lot of people don't even have books.
They don't read.
So we have lots of books.
Just a number of them.
[INAUDIBLE].
Say that question over again.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
It's kind of a mouthful.
I'll repeat it.
Participant 040:
Yeah, I understood what it was, but my brain didn't absorb it.
Interviewer:
That's completely fine.
So what would you say are the most important differences between what someone might consider to be normal saving behavior, like collecting, and hoarding disorder?
