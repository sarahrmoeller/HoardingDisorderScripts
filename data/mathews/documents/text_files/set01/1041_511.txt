Interviewer:
Does your mom still try to get rid of stuff for you or does she lay back and let you figure it out now?
Participant 041:
Yeah, now it's more so let me figure it out, but she's like, "What are you doing?", like asking for progress. Otherwise, no, because I mean we are very close and it's funny because I have so much stuff. She doesn't really have to go shopping for makeup or anything, except for foundation. I mean she likes to buy her own, but I have Fenty and Morphe, all that stuff, whatever stuff. She's like, "You need to stop buying this, but here." It's funny. It's a good relationship but sometimes, like anything, you have your little thing. I'll ask her like, "Can I have this?" It's like, "No, you don't need this."
Participant 041:
Yeah. Now it's more laid-back and just focusing on getting my stuff together. Now with my room, I'm just making sure that everything has a space. That's what I'm trying to do now, and then what I was in the process of doing with, because I have a lot of body care, I was starting to make little goody bags and stuff for people to give away for a gift, for holidays and birthdays and stuff, but you can't do that now because I'm not trying to get sick.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 041:
[inaudible 00:47:19], yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, that basically concludes the interview.
