Interviewer:
Right. Yeah, it's hard to remember that. I see what you're saying is that you're writing at home, you're not that social so to you it hasn't really affected you at all?
Participant 039:
No.
Interviewer:
Has it affected your hoarding in the way of discarding? Have you been discarding more, have you been discarding less?
Participant 039:
Yeah. It has. It has, because I really am home 24/7 or whatever the expression is. I'm becoming more aware of stuff that I don't need that surrounds me and I have begun to slowly get rid of some things.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. That sounds like a positive thing from COVID. What about your acquiring habits, do you acquire a lot, do you buy a lot of stuff? Do you-
Participant 039:
I hardly buy anything. Books have been the thing that I have acquired most recently and for the last 20 years. I have to be one of Amazon's best customers. It just has gotten to a point now that so many of my books that I've purchased, I haven't read and now I'm beginning to realize that I'm never going to be able to read them. Always before, I would say, "Oh, you know, I'm going to take a whole year off and read all these books." Well, it's getting to the point now I realize that I don't have that time left.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 039:
So I'm not buying books. I buy one or two.
Interviewer:
Right. You're noticing that before you kind of had this potential to read things or go through things but now you're having realization that you might not have the time to get to all those things after all.
Participant 039:
That's right.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. Do you think COVID has affected your sense of connectiveness or attachment to your items or is it pretty much the same?
Participant 039:
Well, it's kind of, but it's not COVID per se, it's just that I'm getting older and I have enough nice things and we have, we're both as I said, readers and have bought a lot of books in our time, but not crappy books. Books we buy are very scholarly or are the best literary fiction that is written. Our books are really good books.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
