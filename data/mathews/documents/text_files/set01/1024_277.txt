Participant 24:
And since I live in earthquake country, that could come up too. I know in the past, and I would say the distant past, I've thought about that. What would happen if a fire start in my house, what would I grab to take? Well, of course the dogs I would grab to take first. But as far as inanimate objects, I would probably take some jewelry that was my mother's, because it's very valuable. That's probably one thing I'd grab and that's small. What else would I grab? That's hard to think about.
Interviewer:
It's hard to pick which things would you would take?
Participant 24:
Pardon me?
Interviewer:
It's hard because there's so much that you'd like to take or it's hard because-
Participant 24:
No, it's just because I have to think about so many things.
Interviewer:
Maybe another way of thinking about it is what do you think you'd miss the most, if you didn't have it all?
Participant 24:
That's hard to think about too, because everything except me and my dogs and some antiques I could live without, or I could replace. Now I have to think through what's in each room. Some valuable jewelry would be definitely the first thing I would try to get to.
Interviewer:
That's because it's monetarily valuable and you could sell it? Or is it because it's sentimentally valuable? Because it was your mother's.
Participant 24:
Say that again [inaudible 00:08:42].
Interviewer:
I'm sorry. Is it because it's valuable in terms of money and you could sell it?
Participant 24:
Yes. I would say it's valuable in money and it's also valuable in memories.
Interviewer:
So it's got both of those kinds of value?
Participant 24:
Yes. Correct. And I might even grab ... no I wouldn't grab.
Interviewer:
It's a hard question.
Participant 24:
That's a very good question. Well, it would depend on where I was in the house at the moment that I had to get out. If I was in the bedroom, it would definitely be the jewelry. I don't know that I'd run to any other room. I can buy a new computer. I might grab, because it's easy to grab and unplug the things that I use as a backup to back up everything in my computer. Not the computer, but the backup little box.
Interviewer:
So, you'd want the information rom the computer?
Participant 24:
Yes. That's close, I can run from bedroom into that very easily and grab that very easily. And that has finances and all kinds of things on it. So yes, probably grab that.
Interviewer:
Let's think about the opposite of this. So if you think about all the very cluttered spaces in your house, so your computer room, the back bedroom and the garage, do you feel like there's stuff in there that's trash?
