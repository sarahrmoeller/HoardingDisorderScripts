Participant 040:
Yeah. I made the mistake of mentioning... Forget why I was in there. I had the key, car key in my hand, I was sitting behind the wheel of the car. For a short instance, I did not know what to do with that key. She leapt on that and made me go and take the simulation. I flunked. My eyes don't move real quick. Sometimes I ponder things before I do them, even though I know what it is I'm supposed to be doing. It's slow. It comes. It's not lost. But behind the wheel it could be rather dangerous. Another one of my very big frustrations with me.
Interviewer:
The pondering things or generally the driving?
Participant 040:
Both.
Interviewer:
Both. You said you reached out to psychiatrists, psychologists. Have you ever sought to change hoarding disorder behaviors in any other way?
Participant 040:
No. There's someone, let's see, what's the book called? Take [inaudible 00:17:46] Treasures. Treasure... Many Treasures, something. He has something where you start a small group and commiserate with each other. I thought about that.
Interviewer:
What, about starting a group?
Participant 040:
Uh-huh (affirmative). We help each other.
Interviewer:
Did you ever do that or is that just something that you had thought about doing or something that you're considering doing?
Participant 040:
Just something that crossed my mind that might be fun to do. But if I met here at the house, I have to figure out a place to fit. That would not be necessarily appropriate.
Interviewer:
It would be difficult to find a place to sit?
Participant 040:
Yes. In the living room.
Interviewer:
Why would it be difficult to find a place to sit?
Participant 040:
Well, because the end of the sofa is filled with stuff. Magazines, which I might need someday and I haven't finished reading them. Newspapers that I want to keep. Not real, real old ones, but ones I haven't taken a recipe out of.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. So newspapers and magazines that you might need have recipes or other information you might want?
Participant 040:
Yeah. Things that I'd like to keep handy, but they aren't handy because they're a mess, under something.
But as far as trying to get help, I haven't done much of anything else. I know there are people who come to your house and help you with that, but I haven't gotten into that yet either.
Interviewer:
Okay. But you're kind of aware of some different options?
Participant 040:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
I'm going to switch gears and talk about relationships with family and friends, if that's okay with you?
Participant 040:
Okay.
Interviewer:
I know that you mentioned that your daughters have kind of told you to get rid of some of your stuff. How in general do your family and friends feel about your hoarding disorder or your clutter problems?
Participant 040:
I don't know how they feel. I know my daughters don't like it.
