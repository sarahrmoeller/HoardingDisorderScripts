Interviewer:
Okay, so as you know, this study is investigating individual behaviors and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question would be: what term do you prefer when we refer to your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Interviewee:
Oh, anything you want to call it is fine.
Interviewer:
That’s completely up to you! Some patients don’t care and just call it hoarding disorder, some patients call it clutter, so whatever you prefer.
Interviewee:
Well, clutter, because it’s not that i’m trying to keep things  [INCOHERENT] going through them.
Interviewer:
Okay so, difficulties with clutter would be your preferred term.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay, that’s a great list. So now we’re going to go on into a more conversational like I ask you a question, and you can say whatever you want part of the interview. The first section is going to be about your own behavior and your own problems with clutter.
Interviewee:
Yeah.  Interviewer:
So, can you please describe your clutter problems and how long this has been going on?
Interviewee:
Well I mean I’ve always been messy and cluttered, even when I was a child, you know, I would just stuff things in the drawers and whatever. And I’m pretty sure my mom suffered from some form; she would always have all these stacks of newspapers around and things. But she was not as messy and that sort of thing as I was, but I was always just sort of lazy. Lazy is the prime reason that I’m this way, and secondarily, I look at all these piles, and like I said, I get kind of scared and then I don’t want to deal with it, and I’ll put it off, and pretty soon I’ve done nothing for months, you know, that sort of thing.
Interviewer:
So you mentioned being scared. Could you elaborate more on what scares you about these piles of things that you’ve accumulated over time?
Interviewee:
I don’t know, just having to start going through them and… I don’t know that it’s boring, but it’s really abhorrent to me. I don’t know why I don’t want to deal with it, and you know, it’d be so much easier if I either say folded clothes and put them away or dealt with things immediately after getting them or putting them in their place, but then there’s so many things too that come in that pile up and you know, I kind of spend a lot of time in the front room, so everything kind of winds up in the front room.
It’s a mess. It’s easier if I have somebody.. If I can have someone’s help and like point and tell them to do stuff.
Interviewer:
Right, right. It’s always nice to have someone to help you.
Interviewee:
Yeah, like this 1-800 Got Junk? Commercials look really appealing.
