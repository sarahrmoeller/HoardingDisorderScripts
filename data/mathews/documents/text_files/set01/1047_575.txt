Interviewee47:
My friends kind of ... A couple of my friends are similar.
They're at different levels too.
They like to hold on to stuff too, so they're not very judgemental.
One has mentioned that maybe I need a desk to put my papers on, which I did actually ...
In my bedroom, I have a desk that I just cleared off.
Unfortunately, the stuff I cleared off the desk is now on the floor, so it didn't really get anywhere.
But I do have a clear desk.
I've always used my table as my desk.
I live alone.
I can eat and still have my bills and my things on the table.
If someone comes over though, I do clear that off.
[INAUDIBLE] room and make the table really presentable.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee47:
But lately though, my daughter-in-law's parents have moved up, so none of the social things are happening at my house anymore, and they say because my house isn't as big as her parent's house.
That's part of it, and the other part is that their house is clean.
They can have people over and have them be comfortable in their house.
That kind of makes me sad because I used to have people over for the holidays, and that gave me a chance to actually clean the house and make it suitable for people.
Now I don't have that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So now that we're talking more about your own home, can you tell me what you would like your home to look like?
Interviewee47:
I would like it to be organized and clean, just everything in its place.
I would like to get rid of all the old papers.
I can remember the things I'm proud of with my school stuff.
I can get rid of those.
Interviewer:
So just to have things in it's place.
Interviewee47:
More open space.
Interviewer:
An open space, yeah.
So you would like everything to have its own space.
Interviewee47:
Yeah, its own place and space and more space.
I have 1,000 square foot house.
It's two story.
It's small, but it's cute and it could be really cute.
The outside is painted.
I've got solar panels.
The outside looks really presentable.
Inside, you're like ah.
Another lady came in, a beautician came in one time and she asked me if I was renting.
That made me realize that I'm not keeping things up either.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee47:
She couldn't have me at her place so she came here.
I was like ooh.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So how important are things for you to feel at home?
Which objects are the most important to you?
Interviewee47:
I missed the first part of that?
Interviewer:
How important are things for you to feel at home in your space?
Interviewee47:
How important is it for me to feel at home in my space?
