Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
So now I have something yet to read you, and I'm just going to as some questions about them, okay?
So here's the first one, "John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decide to move.
When items are delivered to his house-
Interviewee:
That was me, from very recently, keep going.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
" When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container that the item came in.
He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he'll need later.
There are stocks of boxes I one of his closets, but there's no boxes in any of the other rooms.
His house was not only as organized but he's usually not cluttered, Occasionally he'll find it difficult to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend a few minutes until he eventually finds them.
When this happens, he is very early late in getting where he needs to be."
Would you say that this is a person who has hoarding problems?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
How come?
Interviewee:
There's a chance he's staying with his wife.
Look at who he was, he dust have a problem right now.
I have a [INAUDIBLE].
Can I call you back in three minutes please?
Interviewer:
Ye, of course.
Interviewee:
Thank you.
Interviewer:
Questions here, okay?
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE] it's my wife that did most of that work and I'm lucky enough to reap the benefits of her wonderful children.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
We need to do the next little VERNET here and you can tell me the same thing again, whether or not you think this is a person with hoarding problems.
So we talked about John Doe, now lets talk about Jane Doe.
" Jane Doe has several boxes that she keeps in case she need to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to her house, she keeps the container, the item came in.
She's worried that she might get rid of a box she'll need later.
Stocks of boxes occupy every room, before entering into her bathroom, she must remove several stacks of boxes.
Her house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for her to walk in her house.
Often it's difficult for Jane doe to find her keys and wallet.
And shell spend 30 minuets to an hour looking for them until she eventually finds them or forgets what she was looking for.
She's almost always late in getting where she needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all."
Do you think that this is a problem for Jane Doe?
Do you think that she's a person who has hoarding problem?
Interviewee:
I do, definitely it sounds like a safety problem too.
She need to be a volunteer FIREMAN.
And that's the kind of stuff you know, you don't want to encounter.
