Interviewer:
Do you feel socially isolated or lonely prior to COVID-19?
Participant 1:
Well, a little bit because my job changed to the point... See, in my last job, the woman ... well, the whole company changed. So our headquarter were in Mountain View. A company bought ... so I started with this company when it was LifeLock. LifeLock two weeks after I started got bought by Symantec. I worked for them and helped them for about seven months, and Symantec laid me off. And Symantec hired me back. And I worked for them for about a year and a half. And then Broadcom bought Symantec.
Interviewer:
Oh, wow. Uh-huh (affirmative).
Participant 1:
So then the company split and I had been in the San Francisco office and wanted to stay there and they moved the corporate headquarters to Arizona which is where LifeLock was because it's cheaper. And so then they laid me off and they reorganized and they laid me off and it's the second time I've been laid off by the same company. So what I see is that before I wasn't happy in my job because everybody I worked with was in a different city. All my team was in Arizona or ... and that all was recent. That has all just changed. So all the changes were driving me nuts. And it was too far for me to drive to Mountain View and then they decided they were going to close the San Francisco office so I'm like, then I don't have a job because then my only option was to move to Arizona. 
So here I am in this horrible job market with all these other people and I'm pretty experienced. So I mean, I've had these major interviews with a company and gone to the final interview, but I don't know. I can't count on anything right now, so that uncertainty is not good.
We're all living with uncertainty. I don't do well with uncertainty.
Interviewer:
For sure. I don't either. Yeah.
Participant 1:
Uh-huh (affirmative). 
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay.
Participant 1:
Uncertainty is not cool.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Absolutely not.
Participant 1:
And people ... there's just people that are prolonging the situation because they won't conform and do what needs to be done. Wear a freaking mask, you know?
Interviewer:
Yeah. I agree completely. Yeah. 
Participant 1:
Stupid ass.
Interviewer:
I know. So the next question is, have you experienced conflict during the COVID-19 measures? That could be with like family or with anyone.
