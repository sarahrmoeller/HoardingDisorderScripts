Interviewer:
Got it.
Participant 018:
... because I didn't want to-
Interviewer:
Got it.
Participant 018:
... deal with that stuff for anything.
Interviewer:
Yeah. So, I'm going to try to repeat back to you what you said, and you can correct me if you think that this is not accurate, but it sounds like you have accumulated this stuff, and part of the problem has been that you get anxious thinking about how much work it's going to be to go through it, and that makes you kind of avoid it, but now you're working on going through it, and you're really dedicated to the task of getting rid of it if it's the right thing to do, but you don't want to get rid of stuff if you don't have time to go through it because you're worried that you'll unintentionally get rid of something that was important.
Participant 018:
Well, there have been times when something was thrown out that was important.
Interviewer:
And that gives you a lot of even more anxiety than holding onto it.
Participant 018:
Yes. It just caused anxiety instead of alleviating the situation.
Interviewer:
It sounds like right now it is causing a problem in your life, both because of the anxiety and because it's a financial burden for you to have to continue to pay for storage space.
Participant 018:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like it gets in the way of your friendships or your relationships with people in any way?
Participant 018:
Well, now I can not have anyone over at this point. There's that issue.
Interviewer:
So, it prevents you from being able to have visitors at your place?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
I'd like to talk about your apartment, your living space now. Could you describe where you're living now and what it's like?
Participant 018:
It's a very tiny efficiency, 430 square feet, just one room.
Interviewer:
What's it like inside?
Participant 018:
Well, now I had to bring some things in from the storage unit because that was broken into, and they stole a lot of things.
Interviewer:
Oh, I'm sorry.
Participant 018:
So, I can't even completely trust having storage now, even though I'm paying.
Interviewer:
Right, right. So, you've even taken things out of storage because you're worried that they'll be stolen, and they're in your apartment?
Participant 018:
Yes. So, now there's a lot of clutter that's come back.
Interviewer:
Is it in boxes? Is it loose?
Participant 018:
Well, it's kind of all in disarray in containers and... Mostly containers, but of various sizes.
Interviewer:
So, mostly, the clutter is contained in various different kinds of boxes and stuff. What sorts of things are-
Participant 018:
But they're not-
Interviewer:
Go ahead.
Participant 018:
They're not currently in boxes that I can easily move from one place to another.
Interviewer:
Okay, okay. So, it's not portable.
