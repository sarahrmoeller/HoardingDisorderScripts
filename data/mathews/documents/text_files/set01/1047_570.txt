Participant 47:
But I think it might have been when I was on my own, starting to be on my own, and I just felt like it was comforting to have possessions of mine that I kept with me to kind of remember things in the past. 
Interviewer:
So you would say that ... So what I'm hearing is that these things comfort you and that your father was also a collector. Do you think this definitely influenced you starting to collect things? I know you said you'd collected coins. Would you say there could be a possible hereditary component, or you just like to collect?
Participant 47:
I don't feel like either of my parents ... My mom especially, I think she was the one that sort of governed what stayed in the house. My dad saved baseball cards and coins and stamps, but they weren't outrageous collections. They didn't take up a whole room or anything like that, or get in the way of anything. They were just, to me, very interesting and it was an interesting hobby. It was something I associated with my dad. My mom didn't have that. She was really poor, so she didn't even have anything to her name. So she was more live in the moment, but she planned for the future. 
So she was probably the more healthy of the two of them that way, but she was the one that always said get rid of stuff as you go and just get rid of clutter. She's very organized. I always felt kind of bad whenever she'd see all my collections. She hasn't been to my house. She passed away this last year, but she hadn't been to my house in a while. She was like, "Jude," and she'd shake her head. I saved toys too. My son, she's 40. He's going to be 40 this year. I saved a lot of his toys. I actually have some of my own toys still, like Barbie dolls and dolls I had.
I have a grandson and he plays with the legos that my son had. So I have a hard time getting rid of toys. I have an entire room filled with toys, and he's six. I'm thinking that, after he's older, I am going to have to get rid of those toys, and that's going to be hard because I felt like my son, I didn't really ... Being a single working mom, I didn't really get to spend as much quality time with him and I'm kind of doing it with my grandson. He's the only grandson, so he's pretty spoiled by all of us. 
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 47:
So I have trouble with that.
