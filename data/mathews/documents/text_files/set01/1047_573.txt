Participant 47:
Someone gave this one to me.
They're not around anymore.
There's a friend that disappeared and she gave that to me.
So when I drink out of that cup, I think of that person.
I know it sounds stupid, but every one of my cups, almost every one has some meaning.
I know exactly where they came from and what was going on at that time.
So it's really hard for me.
Then my daughter-in-law, who is the opposite of me, she doesn't save anything.
She came in and went through my food cupboards and got rid of two huge garbage bags full of food that she saw was expired and don't need anymore.
The only thing of that bunch, it really hurt.
That one really hurt.
It was more the way she did it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 47:
It was kind of like she was disgusted with it.
It was pretty hard.
Interviewer:
Yeah, of course.
Participant 47:
There were some things that I could use, like the food dyes and stuff like that.
My grandson likes to play with some of that stuff, but I didn't have her come back again because it was just the feeling I got that I wasn't ...
She doesn't have any training or anything like that.
It was totally unintentional on her part, but I think the way that people help you really makes a difference.
[INAUDIBLE] very nonjudgmental and very good, but very expensive.
I could only do that one time.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
The expense is a big thing.
Participant 47:
I think I have talked to ... [INAUDIBLE], I did mention that too.
I have gotten a bunch of books on hoarding and collecting, and all those books by all those authors like how to clean and just pick the things that are joyful to you.
So I have done that.
My mind, I'm not dumb.
I've been to school.
I went through nursing school and got my bachelors degree.
I went through social work, almost finished that degree.
So I know what I need to do, but it's the getting started and following through that's really hard for me.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 47:
It's very emotional based.
Interviewer:
Yes, of course.
Yeah, it's a very emotional thing.
So you mentioned that you did go to a counselor.
How did you find this person?
Participant 47:
I think through recommendations from my doctor-
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 47:
I went just recently, it was for something else.
It was for work.
When my mom died, I kind of had a little breakdown.
It was just really hard.
So I was kind of dealing with that and letting the other thing kind of slide.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 47:
It was basically something my insurance was on the insurance list, and I tried to find someone who specialized in things that looked like my problems.
