Interviewer:
So most of the things that make you feel at home are the pictures of your family and then stuff you've collected from traveling, like antiques and stuff like?
That's what makes it homey?
Interviewee:
Yeah, things that are special, that have significance.
Not just a bunch of random objects, things that have significance.
From family or travel or growing up or memories.
Things like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So when you think about your possessions, how do you determine their value?
Or if they're valuable or not?
Interviewee:
Just for their meaning, I think, what they mean.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I really would have trouble letting go of stuff if it was stuff from my late husband say, or like I said, my son or my mom or people that have been always special to me.
I would have trouble getting rid of anything that came from them and had something to do.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So you value things based on their sentimentality, sentimental attachment to them.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Right.
Not value like monetary, that doesn't really bother me.
I don't ... yeah.
Interviewer:
What would you consider trash?
How do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Interviewee:
I guess if something's broken and can't be fixed.
The funny story, I have this big pottery canister which I've always loved and I broke it.
I dropped it and it broke.
I was like, jeez, maybe somebody could still do something with this.
I hate to just throw it away.
It's kind of just been sitting here.
Then I saw on one of the neighborhood forums that a woman is making mosaics and she's like, "Does anyone have any broken pottery or whatever?" I sent her a picture, so I'm going to meet her on Friday and give it to her.
I was so happy.
Like oh this isn't going to sit in a landfill now.
Somebody's going to use it.
But no, seriously, if something's truly broken and can't be repaired and has no value left for anybody, I'm okay with it going in the garbage.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
When I read a newspaper, I recycle it right away.
I don't keep anything that I'm done with.
It's funny, living in rural Vermont, it's a totally different attitude than growing up at the Jersey shore.
People here really do reuse, recycle, repurpose.
There's free boxes on the side of the road all the time because people don't want stuff, they just put it out for free.
It's a very thrifty area and there's nowhere to really shop, which is good for me, it's been good for me because there's really nowhere to go.
So that helps.
