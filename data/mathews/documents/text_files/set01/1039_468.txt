Interviewer:
Gotcha, so the budget for sure.
Okay.
What is trash for you?
What do you discard, what things are you-
Participant 039:
Very little.
Interviewer:
Very little.
Okay.
Participant 039:
Very little.
When I print, I'm a writer right now so after I write something and I print it out in order to read it or to edit it, I'll print it out and I use both sides of the paper and then I may not even throw it out then which in the last several months has been causing me a lot of heartache, because my place where I write is so full of papers and books that then when I have to get my hands on something I have to go through all these papers which should have been thrown out because I've edited and done what I wanted to do and it's no longer applicable.
I should throw it out but for some reason I just hang on to it and if there's a page that has a space not used, I will sometimes cut it away from the part that is used and I save half a page of paper.
I have stacks of these little bits of paper that I use to take notes.
For some reason, I got into the habit and this is many years ago, of keeping notes on scraps of paper.
Instead of using a notebook or a pad of paper I keep all this stuff on scraps of paper and I mean, I've got not only piles right now in front of me but I have, when I finally decide to clean up I will, instead of going through and sorting them out I'll just put them in a paper bag and store them.
Interviewer:
Got it.
It sounds like what you're telling me is you don't really throw that much stuff away and you'll even save scraps of paper that have a little bit of space even though maybe it would be a better idea to throw it out, because then you have a lot of papers to sort through?
Participant 039:
Right.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Okay.
Let's-
Participant 039:
The same thing goes for paper towels or napkins.
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
Always just saving little parts?
Participant 039:
I don't waste any part of a paper towel.
If I dry my hands on a paper towel that paper towel is saved.
I put it some place in the kitchen so that I can get my hands on it to dry my hands on it again because by the time I use it again, it's dry.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay.
Then this is actually a great transition.
We can talk more about your space and your living area.
Seems like you don't throw a lot of things away, does that mean you have a lot of clutter in your home?
Can you tell me about what you space looks like?
