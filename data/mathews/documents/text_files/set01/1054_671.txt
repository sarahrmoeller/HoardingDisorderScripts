Interviewee:
I sound like my sister is a bitty— which sometimes she is— but yeah, it’s just, whenever she talks to me about, “You need to get rid of this, you need to get rid of that,” it’s just, it’s just like I ball my fist up.
Like, you're not going to make me get rid of stuff.
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee:
Because I want this stuff.
Interviewer: Yeah, like you said, for you it's more about, um, the things that have value to you personally.
So, it's understandable that it would be frustrating if someone else can't see that same value or doesn't understand why you keep these things.
Interviewee:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: I know you mentioned earlier that seeing the clutter in other people's homes, like your niece’s home, was really overwhelming to you.
So, for you, it's, it's, you know, better to have less things than to have more things, right?
So, it's better to be—
Interviewee:
Oh Lord, yes.
I want to be able to walk in my bedroom and see nothing on the floor.
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: And most of the reason why is just because it's overwhelming to try and tackle it all at once, right?
Interviewee:
Right.
Yeah, very overwhelming being told I have to get rid of things.
Just, just makes my jaw lock.
Interviewer: Right.
So, that's especially frustrating for you, is when other people try and tell you that you need to get rid of stuff now.
Interviewee:
Oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: So, what do you consider most precious out of your belongings?
Interviewee:
I have a trio [inaudible; ].
After four years working for [name of place; inaudible; ], I’ve got [INAUDIBLE] and I have a collection.
They're called “[NAME]_OF_PLACE.”
It’s before the, they’ve done the final firing where they make it shiny, which is definitely not cheap to me.
Interviewer: Mhmm.
Interviewee:
These things are just— oh, they’re beautiful.
I just love them.
But, I have been doing better because I, I, I’m now buying unique things.
When I see a rose I’m not just buying a rose.
Interviewer  Right.
Interviewee:
It has to be something special.
Interviewer: So, in the past, would you say that you were definitely more liberal with what you considered, you know, valuable enough to buy?
Interviewee:
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.
