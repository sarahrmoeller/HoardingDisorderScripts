Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. Okay. So could you please describe where you live now? What's the space like?
Participant 1:
Well, my space is very small. It's a room with a bathroom and I share a house with ... well, I don't share a house. I just have a room with a bathroom and I have my little refrigerator in the bathroom. I have no place to cook. And so when I buy groceries I have to buy mostly takeout when I'm down here but this is my place in the city so that I can work, but now with COVID it's become crazy because the libraries are closed. This is just a place for me to sleep. It's got all my work clothes. It's got all the stuff I need for work. Stuff to get ready for work. It's got a TV in my Keurig and all my stuff. And stuff I use all the time. Then at my house up in the foothills has my long-term stuff and my furniture and everything else. And it's all my cooking and it's a full home, so I go back and forth between the two.
This is basically I use it just to sleep and now with COVID it's horrible because they've closed every place else where I can go to work.
Interviewer:
Yeah. I know. It's definitely horrible.
Participant 1:
I had this specifically as a place to sleep when I go to work in the Bay Area.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. Let's see. Are there parts of your home that you consider cluttered in your view and what makes them cluttered?
Participant 1:
My living room. My table. My dining room table is full of stuff. And the stuff ... when I get up there, I open my computer and I lay out my mail and there's mail and there's stuff on the floor. And I get through stuff and then I cook and I put everything away. It's not like I just leave ... I'm not one of these really cluttered people where you can't walk around. So not like that. I'm not like that. But I do have piles that I'm concerned about because I just don't do anything with that.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay.
Participant 1:
So yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Let me see here. Okay. When do you think about ... oh, sorry. I'm lost. When you think about your possessions, there we go, what makes them valuable?
Participant 1:
Oh what makes them valuable?
Interviewer:
Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative).
