Participant 039:
Now, and I'm not totally to blame, we've outgrown this house.
We either both need to get rid of a lot of stuff or move to a bigger house.
Interviewer:
Maybe the former.
Participant 039:
Yeah.
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That makes sense.
Tell me about your partner, your relationship with her and how it affects, how she approaches it?
Seems like she's pretty active in motivating you to get rid of stuff especially because you have guests over and things like that.
Is that right?
Participant 039:
Yeah.
She's actually very easy to get along with.
She doesn't nag me about it, but occasionally she'll say, "Okay.
You've got to get those piles out of the living room."
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 039:
"You promised me that you wouldn't clutter the living room."
And I did promise her, so then I'll clean things up.
But on the other hand, we have the big low table in there and it's got as many of her books and magazines on it as I have books.
I'm not the only one that makes piles or clutters things.
The funny thing is that when people come to visit us, bar none, every single guest says, "Oh, your house is so comfortable.
You're one of the few houses that I go to that I'm completely comfortable in."
We're bursting at the seams here, so it says something about people, in general.
The friends we have are not just like us, so I've come to the conclusion that people like the sense of a house well lived in and even though it's cluttered it's cluttered with things that you the owner like and feel comfortable with and it feels like a home to them.
Some people have actually said that.
Interviewer:
Right, because it looks actually lived in, right?
Participant 039:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
But then it becomes that kind of level like that's great that people are saying that, however, it's clearly getting in the way of you living your normal life.
Participant 039:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interesting.
Participant 039:
We both, NAME is my partner's name.
She used to know some people, well, she still knows them, but they used to have a house up in Massachusetts and occasionally we would go up to visit them.
Well, they and this was a huge rambling house, but talk about the feel of clutter and a house lived in.
Again, everybody that visited them said the same thing.
The LOCATION house, oh my God, it's such a rambling old house and it's such a mess and clutter of things but it is so comfortable.
