Interviewer:
Would you be upset if you had to give up some of your items?
Interviewee:
Well, a little bit.
I mean I wouldn't go ...
It depends on which items I had to get rid of.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
[INAUDIBLE].
Which items do you think would make you the most upset to give away?
Interviewee:
I thought you had already asked me that once.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
My CDs, my books.
My movies and my clothes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
And I suppose my electronic things.
TV, the computer, printer.
Interviewer:
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Okay.
What do you think are the most important differences between normal saving behavior to just collecting and hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Well, if you watch the TV show on hoarding, they save stuff that makes no sense, like newspapers and pieces of paper and the styrofoam dishes or just anything that has absolutely no use to anybody.
Maybe sometimes they don't throw out their food or something like that.
To me, a worry gets on a worry of saving things that have no use at all.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Okay.
And how is that same or different from your behavior?
Interviewee:
I do throw out dirty pieces of paper and bottles and cans and cigarette butts and pieces of paper and even clothes once in a while when I have energy to go through them.
I have not thrown out bills in a long, long time and they definitely need to be.
I've been thinking about paying somebody to go through them and throw them out.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
That's basically it.
Interviewer:
Okay, perfect.
Where do you get information about hoarding disorder?
You mentioned the TV, but I'm wondering if there's any other place maybe?
Interviewee:
No. I read about it years ago in psychology class, and I see those shows on TV, but I don't watch them particularly.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How has COVID 19 impacted you?
Has it impacted any cluttering behaviors?
Interviewee:
Probably a little worse because I have to stay home so much.
I used to eat out so I didn't have to wash dishes and I didn't have quite as many styrofoam cups maybe.
I probably didn't even smoke as much because when I'm in the car I'm not as likely to smoke as I am sitting here.
What me looking at the computer for hours and hours and hours, and I don't really go anywhere.
I'm very afraid of getting it, so it really limits what I can do.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Has it affected your difficulties of throwing things away?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
How has COVID affected your sense of connectiveness or attachment to your items?
Interviewee:
I don't think it has.
Interviewer:
Since COVID, how do you think your attempts to declutter have been affected?
Have you had any more time for organizing?
Interviewee:
No. I'm just as lazy as I'm sitting here now as I ever was before.
