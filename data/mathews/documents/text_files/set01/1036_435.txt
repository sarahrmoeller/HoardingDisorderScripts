Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative),So I want to return to something that you told me before we even started the interview. So you said it was getting really bad when you had your house but your kids had an intervention, could you tell me about that?
Participant 036:
Sure. My wife and I had a pretty nice house in beautiful Golden, Colorado along the side of South Table Mountain and 2,000 square foot organic [inaudible 00:12:19] blah, blah, blah. Just a nice middle-class house. Good views, I liked it just fine so my wife picked it out, she liked it too. Anyway she dies and my children ... We have three children who grew up in this house, one boy and two girls. They moved on, they're adults. They're older, they're adults and they would come visit and it got to the point where they'd come visit me and my dog, Betty, and they'd look around the house and get a room at the local motel, didn't want the children coming into that clutter and that stuff, and that's when it ...
It reached the point where they actually got to together and explained to me very nicely, [inaudible 00:13:10] is really a problem and all the bedrooms that they weren't in anymore full of stuff, and they were right. I [inaudible 00:13:18] that. So I sold my house, no place to go, our daughter, "[inaudible 00:13:24] with. I hope you build a new house." And here I am. So it was not a legal intervention, it was just a matter of getting together and talking to me saying, "Listen." And I'm luckily enough to have rationale children, they're very ... They're fortunate to take after their mother in that aspect, I think.
Interviewer:
I was just going to say, it sounds like you have lovely children.
Participant 036:
Oh, I do. The biggest problem I have with my adult children. Is, it's hard for me to talk about it without sounding like I'm bragging. It's difficult for me to be modest and honest regarding my children, but anyway, so what I did do was I said, "Okay, new start." And after a while, it was getting hard. I found myself I had more people to come over to visit me, really a problem and happy with that too. To get back on my  what little social life I have because [inaudible 00:14:18] that the ... So when all three adult children show up one day and actually spend a couple days, go through the house and the basement. We had a basement full of books and stuff. [inaudible 00:14:30] stuff to the basement, take what they wanted and let them divvy up how they wanted it.
