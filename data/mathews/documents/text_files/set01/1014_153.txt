I'm a vet, so I notice when they take animals out of hoarding situations.
Interviewer:
Hm. How do you feel about the hoarding television shows?

Well, they're helping people.
They're trying to help them so I think that's a good thing.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
I think about somebody who's got too much stuff and they can't function well because of it.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And does your behavior upset you?
Interviewee:
Nope.
Interviewer:
Could you think of a time when it got in the way of something you really wanted?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:

Interviewee:
I'd just really like to have the time to sort through everything.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE, so if you-
Interviewee:
Which I don't, since I'm still working full-time, so I don't.
But I don't really want to change myself, I just want to be able to go through everything and try to get rid of stuff that has no use or sentimental value.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So if you did have the time, you would want to sort through and discard?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Yeah.
In fact, when my husband gets to a box that belongs to the kids, he lets me sort that, but then I sort them and rather than throwing much away, I put for each child who's now an adult, I have a box to go to them to next time we see them, they're going to get some of their childhood belongings.
