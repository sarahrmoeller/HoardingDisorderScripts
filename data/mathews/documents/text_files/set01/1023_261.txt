Interviewer:
Right. So it seems that there are some areas like the couch with the papers, the dining room with also projects, where there are areas of your home that are being utilized but not necessarily utilized for the purpose that they're intended to?
Participant 23:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Interviewer:
Would you say that there are any other areas of the home that are maybe being used as storage and not as they're intended to like the stove or the bathtub or other areas? 
Participant 23:
No, no. That's where we kind of draw the line. All the appliances, all the bathrooms, all of those are fine. I will not let it get to that point. As I've said, I had my aunt who had a really, really bad problem and I would never let it get to that point. But I do notice that there are as I said, there are piles of photos in the dining room. That's not ideal. And when we're hosting people, that's not what we ideally want to be in there. But no, there's nothing on the stove or in the showers or, or bathtubs or anything like that. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And what would you like your home to look like? 
Participant 23:
I'd like it to just to have less. To have space on a shelf and not things piled up. I'd like to have a lot less stuff.
Interviewer:
Right. So ideally-
Participant 23:
The challenge is, I don't like to get rid of things and my partner really likes to get things. So that combination is a really, really tough combination. Because she loves to get yes things and she'll get rid of things, but she likes to get things and I, once we get things like I'm okay with not accumulating more, I just can't get rid of stuff. So we end up with a lot more influx than output, which is the [problem 00:32:08] So I'd like to have a home that has just clean empty areas. It doesn't have to be totally minimalist, but I'd like it to have like really open surfaces and stuff. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, of course. And how important are your things for you to feel at home and what are the objects that you think are the most important to you?
