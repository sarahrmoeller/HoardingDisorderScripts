Participant 17:
You have me at a loss for words on that one. I don't know, I can't decide. 
Interviewer:
That's okay. Let's think about when you said you had donated some items, how did you decide that it was time to let those go?
Participant 17:
I realized I hadn't used it in a very, very long time and had no intent upon using it, and I did not think any of my children would want it. Usually I run that by my kids, if it's something like candlesticks that I had when I got married to their dad I'll say, "Do you want these?" And of course they don't remember when I married their dad, my two youngest don't even remember their dad they were so little when he passed away. If those three things are met, then I don't have a problem getting rid of it, or if it's a duplicate of something. 
Interviewer:
Okay. All right, that makes sense. Thank you for... I know it's difficult, but thank you for trying. Out of the items you mentioned earlier, your rocks and crystals, your books, and your photos, what is the most precious item in your house for you?
Participant 17:
I'm trying to think of what thing I would grab if my house was on fire, if I had to leave it. It would either be, I think it would be photos of my children. 
Interviewer:
Okay. All right. What would happen if you lost them?
Participant 17:
I would feel like somebody had hit me in the chest and knocked me out because that was the feeling I had when the kids got rid of some things that I really, really wanted and those little things that I'm still bitter about today. They would have no meaning, they're not significant at all, but they were to me at the moment, and that felt like I was being stabbed or robbed, something like that. 
Interviewer:
All right. Thank you. I think that's the most descriptive answer I've gotten so far when I ask people. That answered everything in when we were talking about values, so the next thing is distinguishing hoarding disorder. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal sane behavior and what would be considered hoarding disorder?
Participant 17:
Hoarding would not have organization. Hoarding would not have logical meaning to other people. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 17:
Possessions would be equated in hoarding, to safety or security. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Do you have anything else or do you think that pretty much sums it up. 
Participant 17:
I think that summarizes it.
