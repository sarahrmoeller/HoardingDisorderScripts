Interviewer:
I understand that.
Interviewee:
Still overwhelming.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So, you still feel a little overwhelmed by the presence of this stuff, and it still causes you some problems.
Interviewee:
And all the rent that it's cost.
Interviewer:
So, you're still paying for storage units, or are you paying an increased rent?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So, it's a financial burden?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Over the time that you've lived with these problems, have you sought out help, I guess, to deal with not only this stuff itself, but to deal with the kind of impulse to save?
Have you ever gone to see a doctor about it or talked to anyone?
Interviewee:
No, nothing professional.
Interviewer:
How have you sought help for the feeling of being overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that you have?
I mean, have you turned to family?
Have you turned to friends?
Interviewee:
Oh, I talk to family and friends on occasion, and now I'm always spending time going through things every now and then.
Interviewer:
So, it's mostly something you deal with on your own, but you will ask family and friends sometimes for help with it.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How do your family and friends feel about it?
What kind of advice do they give you?
What do they say?
Interviewee:
Well, my sister is the one who's taken on the minimalist belief, which to me it feels like the same disorder because she's trying to be so far to extreme where you're not allowed to keep anything at all.
Interviewer:
So, she's kind of reacted against it?
Interviewee:
She's reacting so extreme that it's impossible to deal with.
Interviewer:
So, she's really trying to get rid of all possessions.
She doesn't think anything is worth saving.
Interviewee:
She doesn't believe anyone should own anything.
Interviewer:
Wow.
That's pretty extreme, huh?
Interviewee:
At all.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Has this caused conflict for you with her?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So, you have arguments with her about whether or not you should keep things?
Interviewee:
Yes.
I can't get help since she's that extreme.
It's like a barrier-
Interviewer:
She can't help you.
Interviewee:
... so I can't get a lot of help anyway.
Interviewer:
Right, because you know if she tried to help you, she would just get rid of all your stuff.
Interviewee:
Yeah, everything.
At one point I did do that once, and I threw out one thing without going through it, and then later I realized there was valuable things, which caused regret.
Interviewer:
So, you tried really hard to take her advice, it sounds like, but when you did it that way, you had the experience of regretting getting rid of stuff, and so that has really made it so that you don't want to-
Interviewee:
Well, it was that I threw something out without knowing what it was...
