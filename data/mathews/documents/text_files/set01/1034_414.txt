Interviewer:
No. I've read Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five. And I'm working through the rest of them. 
Participant 34:
Yes, good, good. Well, I have a library of Vonnegut as well as considerable stuff on gays. And I have all my old yearbooks from high school and college. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. Sounds-
Participant 34:
I taught a course called, the Political Ideas of Kurt Vonnegut. 
Interviewer:
That's an interesting book. 
Participant 34:
When I was teaching college back in the '70s. 
Interviewer:
You were teaching college? 
Participant 34:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay. You've had a rich history. A lot of these have primed you to see the value of items and keep them. And I hope that someone else finds the same value in these items because they're definitely [crosstalk 00:42:12]. 
Participant 34:
Yes, yes. Well, I do to because I don't think I've got a real plan for what happens to them when I'm not around. 
Interviewer:
Well, now that you have all this time, probably more so sequestered in your home than before, due to COVID, have you found that there's extra time to organize items? 
Participant 34:
Well, I've found more time to think about organizing them, yes. And the prospect of moving, as I said, I'm interested in donating, getting rid of a lot of stuff in order not to move it. But then, the donation and getting rid of, and selling things is, those are things that entail a lot of work. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. They do require [crosstalk 00:43:12]. 
Participant 34:
And time and figuring out social distancing and what have you as well. 
Interviewer:
Have you found that being in your home more so than before, if that's the case, has affected your sense of connectedness or your attachment to the items you have? 
Participant 34:
Possibly. Since I'm seeing the items I have every day, it's like well, what are they for? What use are they? I don't think of myself as the classic hoarder they mention in the movie, where the guy's got stacks of newspapers, and he can't find the stove, stuff like that. 
But I do have a lot of stuff. And that's a concern because I don't need access to that stuff. Or a need to organize and know what that stuff is, like I started, added a program to my phone, where I can scan the bar codes on the books in my library. And so I've done that for all of the books in my Rousseau library that bar codes. But I've got the older books that didn't have bar codes. Some of them are as old as 18th century, 19th century publications. And 20th century. 
Interviewer:
You seem to [crosstalk 00:45:25]
Participant 34:
So those I have to enter in by hand. And that's work.
