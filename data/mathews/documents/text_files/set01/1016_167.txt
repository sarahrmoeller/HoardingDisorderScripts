Interviewee:
I could identify loneliness, boredom, I can identify feelings, but I can't identify issues such as hoarding, unable to move forward, and so forth.
So I didn't identify it as a problem.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm 
Interviewee:
I was then embarrassed to talk to a therapist I didn't know well.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
My most recent two therapists, I would have talked to, but two people back I was still working, so it wasn't a problem.
The woman I see now, I've been seeing for a year plus.
Interviewer:
Okay, so [CROSSTALK]
Interviewee:
I've alluded to it, but I've not said I want to talk about this.
Interviewer:
So it goes back to familiarity and feelings of embarrassment?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Yes, yes.
Interviewer:
I know that you've mentioned pretty much every room in the house except for your bedroom and your bathroom are pretty cluttered, but what would you like your house to look like?
Interviewee:
Oh, the way it used to look like.
I have really nice windows.
All of my windows were replaced 10 years or so back, and I have low light in every room.
I would love to have people in my house again, once the pandemic is over, and I'm real friendly and neighborly and I love to talk to people and visit.
I'm not a great hostess because I haven't entertained as much as most people do, but I do enjoy having small groups in my house and people that share interest with me.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you'd like to be able to socialized again and have [CROSSTALK]
Interviewee:
Yes, socialize.
Interviewer:
And which objects are most important to you?
I know you mentioned your books are important, but are those the most important to you?
Interviewee:
No. I have gone to arts and crafts shows since I was in my late twenties or very early thirties, and I collect pottery.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm 
Interviewee:
I've given away a lot, but I have some large bowls made by a wonderful potter that I got to know.
She's a pottery professor at the college where I was.
I don't want to get rid of those, and they take up space.
I have a five shelf glassed in, it was a bookcase, but I've turned into a place where I keep some of my bone china mugs and teapots.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Everything in there is that.
And then I have in a dining room, I forget the name of the piece of furniture, I have things from my mother and I have something that she got as a wedding gift back in 1944.
I have several things that she got then.
I have gifts from a friend from Pakistan who died two years ago and they were related to having tea.
I collect things related to Christmas, so I have Christmas teapots, Christmas mugs, Christmas plates.
