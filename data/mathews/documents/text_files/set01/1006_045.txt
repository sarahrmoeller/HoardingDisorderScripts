Interviewer:
Yeah, yeah. What do you think would happen if you lost it?
Participant 006:
The precious things?
Interviewer:
Yeah, the photos from your grandmother and of your family.
Participant 006:
I would just be bereft, I don't know what I'd do.
Interviewer:
All right, yeah. Do you think you have too much stuff?
Participant 006:
Absolutely.
Interviewer:
Yeah. How do you know? How do you decide when you have too much?
Participant 006:
I don't have room for everything. I have piles of craft stuff in my hallway. I'm trying to clean out my sewing room, which is a spare bedroom. I moved all of that out into the hallway and I still have a big mess, and it's taking me months to get through this.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 006:
I did finally go through, I had a huge stash, I guess you'd say, of books. I'd finally gone through some of that and let some of those things go. But I'm really having difficulty with the craft items in particular.
Interviewer:
Okay, with the craft items. Yeah. What if you had to choose between your items? How would you choose, if you had to throw some of them away?
Participant 006:
I guess I would just stick with the things I know that I want to do, let the rest of it go, if I can figure out how to do that.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. Does your hoarding upset you? Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant 006:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Can you describe a time when your hoarding got in the way of something you really wanted?
Participant 006:
I don't really quite know how to answer that. I would like to get up and have the freedom to choose what I'd like to do for the day without thinking, I can't do that until I get this cleaned up, or I need to go through this pile and take it to the thrift shop. Every day, my mind is occupied with what I should be doing, rather than what I would like to do. Does that makes sense?
Interviewer:
Yes. You would say it's more general, rather than one specific instance that you can think of?
Participant 006:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 006:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
All right. I know we talked about how one of your sons, it was really uncomfortable for him to come in. Does it upset any of your other loved ones?
Participant 006:
Not really.
Interviewer:
Okay. Okay, cool. You would like to change your behavior because of your son's discomfort?
Participant 006:
Partly. Mostly, for my discomfort. I'm embarrassed that people see that I don't have control over my life. I want the freedom of mind, I want to be able to get up and enjoy things, rather than looking at more to do. If that makes sense.
