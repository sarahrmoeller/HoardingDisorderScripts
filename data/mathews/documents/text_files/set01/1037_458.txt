Participant 37:
I think [inaudible 00:23:59] I could do my list on this question because the few collections that I haven't thought about divesting yet are things that I think are just brilliant and I really like them. I guess I have to ask the question, okay do I need to have it? The answer is probably no. Can I afford to have it? The answer is yes. So it's a balance. I haven't reached a point where I don't want to have it and of course I've forgotten the question [crosstalk 00:24:41] me again?
Interviewer:
No that was actually good. You mentioned that you ask yourself do I need this or can I afford it. No that's good, that's how you determine if you keep an object or not. So what would you consider trash, what do you discard?
Participant 37:
Oh boy. Part of the clutter that we have was recycling and my mother was a very early recycler, which is nice.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 37:
But if you become... I have been fairly obsessive about recycling but recently certain things that I've read and just trying to live life we've decided actually yesterday that we may not be recycling everything that can be recycled or that we can try to recycle. So, what was the question again? I'm getting lost.
Interviewer:
The question was, what do you consider trash or what do you discard? [crosstalk 00:26:15]
Participant 37:
That's part of the issue and I think that one of the problems that's I have had, which I managed to not do the last two days is if I get a package, because we do buy things by mail a lot.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
More than we might otherwise-
Interviewer:
Because of Covid?
Participant 37:
Because of the pandemic.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
Yeah. So I'll open the envelope and, okay I could reuse the envelope. Well, yeah, sure I can but will I ever? And the answer is probably not [crosstalk 00:26:49]. And that's something that was a small epiphany after I got rid of 50 envelopes yesterday.
Interviewer:
Right so, sometimes you keep things thinking you might use them and then you never end up using them?
Participant 37:
Yeah and I think, okay I'll just throw it in this box. Am I going to need this cord again then I'll save that one. I think I'm trying to get away from that. So learning what's trash is a new concept for me.
Interviewer:
Okay well that's good. 
Participant 37:
It's a little hard because of my background.
Interviewer:
Right. Okay, well at least you're learning, that's what's important. What is the most precious in your house for you?
Participant 37:
Wow. 
Interviewer:
Or collection of items.
