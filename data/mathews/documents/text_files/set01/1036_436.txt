I just took my tools. I do have some problems, medical issues. It's [inaudible 00:14:42] to use hand tools like I did at one time and no they just took pretty much what they wanted and took them. So they took ... They had memories too up here, tearing the pictures off the wall, that sort of thing. And I sold the house, I took a pretty big hit on selling the house because I left all the clutter in it and that made the house hard to sell. So I took a substantial [inaudible 00:15:09] count on it but like I really care anyway. [inaudible 00:15:12] it's only money. I care les about money than I do stuff I guess.
Interviewer:
I understand that. That sounds like a huge step. I think you should feel really good about the fact that you were able to let all that stuff go. A lot of people really struggle with that but it sounds like you were able to just say, "Okay, it's not that important. My kids are right." And just walk away from the house and start a new life.
Participant 036:
Well, that's pretty much what I had to do and that was made a little easier because, I've had some minor brain damage. I had a little oxygen [inaudible 00:15:41] to find the substances. The nurses told me I hit the 85% mortality rate.
Interviewer:
Wow.
Participant 036:
So I wasn't quite the same guy I used to be. I walked out of the hospital with maybe a 30/50 IQ drop.
Interviewer:
Oh my gosh.
Participant 036:
A 30/50 points lower IQ-
Interviewer:
I can't imagine you before that because you are a very sharp gentleman right now.
Participant 036:
[inaudible 00:16:07] but I know for sure, I was thinking about a rate about 130, the average person and [inaudible 00:16:15] gives me very poor [inaudible 00:16:18]. So I fall over [inaudible 00:16:19]. You have to think really fast to just keep from falling over and some other side issues like that that made my life more difficult.
