Participant 043:
Yes. I do live alone. I have a one bedroom unit with a den. It's got a big bathroom and bay windows in each room. The kitchen is pretty small and that's where the counters are and that's where I have a lot of stuff that I put down. There's a box in the doorway where I've been putting stuff that I want to get rid of.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. You mentioned that that area that you mentioned a couple of times it has some stuff on it is the countertops. Are there any other rooms in your space that you feel like are of the same nature as the countertops?
Participant 043:
My craft room, which is what I'm making my den into. We hadn't gone through the boxes because I moved last October after I had the pneumonia. When I came back, they got me into a unit on the first floor, which was bigger, and some of the boxes and stuff haven't been completely unpacked with my crafts and stuff and I have so many different crafts. It's hard to organize the stuff. In my bedroom, I had been on a trip and I still haven't even put all my stuff away since I got back.
Interviewer:
You mentioned that your den area/craft room and your countertops have a lot of things. Maybe boxes and items. Would you consider these parts of your home cluttered and what makes them cluttered to you if so?
Participant 043:
It's cluttered because, basically, I have to move things in order to allow somebody to sit on the sofa or love seat. I'm having trouble in my bedroom because I have kyphoscolisis and I have trouble hanging things up in the closet. I'm going to lower the shelves but I have had crafts and stuff maintenance isn't doing any broken stuff in the units, not while all this is going on.
Interviewer:
Of course. Yeah. You did mention that your countertops are kind of unusable right now just because there are things on top of it. Would you say there are other parts of your home that aren't really being used in the way that they're intended? Are you using other items like the countertops for storage?
