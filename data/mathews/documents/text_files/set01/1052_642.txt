Interviewer: Okay. Alright, so this next part of the interview is going to be more like a general conversation.
I’m going to start out by asking you if you could describe your problems with clutter for me.
Interviewee:
Describe my clutter problems?
Interviewer: Mhmm.
Interviewee:
I, uh, exceeded in my workspace and I’m surrounded by one, two, three, four, five, six file cabinets and storage units about them.
In my storage, some of the file cabinets are open.
The floor is covered with different piles of different files.
And, um, it would be very hard for me to tell someone what to do with this stuff if I was unable to return to access something or a client.
There are important papers among these things, there are a number of unimportant papers among these things.
And I’m also experiencing some distress about what to do with things that although I don’t intend to use them and haven’t for the past ten years, I have some emotional distress about the idea of disposing of them.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, would you say that most of the things that you tend to hoard are papers?
Interviewee:
In this space, almost entirely papers.
At home, it would include tools, working and broken; Participants, working and broken; guitars, working and broken.
Um…
Interviewer: Okay.
And, can you remember how long this behavior has been going on?
Interviewee:
Probably, um… probably the better part of my life.
It’s been more apparent in the past thirty years that I’ve been enjoying s stable living space.
I find that if you need to move frequently it’s hard to hoard because you have to figure out what can fit in the truck.
Interviewer: Right.
So, before these last thirty years were you moving frequently?
Interviewee:
I moved often enough that I didn’t accumulate a distressing amount of stuff.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, it was only after you kind of settled down that you started accumulating more things?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer: Okay.
And in your opinion, how severe would you say that your behavior is right now?
Interviewee:
Um, well I work with people in addiction services as well, and one of the amusing terms people use frequently is, “I’m not that bad.”
So, I’ll fill that trope and say I’m not that bad, but bad enough that I’m willing to going through the discomfort of talking about it out loud and explaining it to another person.
I’m not that uncomfortable.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, you do believe it is a problem then?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Okay.
And, is there any particular reason why you think it’s a problem?
What part of your life does it affect that makes you think it’s a problem?
