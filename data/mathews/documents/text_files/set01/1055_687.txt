Participant:
Yes, yes. And, when there’s two bedrooms that aren’t being used because of all that stuff.
Interviewer : Mhmm. So, you know, before you were going through your mom’s stuff, did it ever get in the way of, you know, your daily life back at home trying to get rid of stuff?
Participant:
Well, at home, I was just kind of putting off going through stuff there to keep up with the normal types of activities as far as washing clothes and washing dishes like that. And I was not doing anything about the stuff there.
Interviewer : Right. So, you know, having to deal with your mom’s stuff has definitely, you know, made you look more at the process of getting rid of stuff and determining what's valuable.
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer : Gotcha. So, do you think it's going to make it easier for you in your own house to do that, now that you've kind of been forced to do it with your mom’s stuff?
Participant:
I hope so, but most likely I’ll go right back to the way I was before. Just working on laundry and dishes, rather than getting into it.
Interviewer : Right, you know, finding ways to, you know, not quite look at it all the time. I understand. So, I know we said that it definitely caused some conflict with your husband, but, um, how about anybody else in your family?
Participant:
No. Now, my son when he was alive, he was upset about it. Because he, because he had one bedroom that he could not use.
Interviewer : Right. So, why couldn’t he use that bedroom then?
Participant:
Because I wanted to keep everything. So, we had one bedroom that was, that I kept all of his toys and belongings in.
Interviewer : Mhmm. So, was that like a guest room or was it his actual bedroom?
Participant:
Well, we had a three-bedroom house. So, he has one bedroom. The other bedroom was a good bit bigger, the one I kept putting any kind of his toys or old clothes in.
Interviewer : Gotcha. Did it ever prevent him from having friends over?
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer : Okay. Do you have any specific memories of that happening?
Participant:
Well, just by him. The cycle I guess just alone, where he was embarrassed also having people over.
Interviewer : Right. So, how about, you know, your own friends. Are you, you said that your husband was embarrassed for, you know, the idea of having people over, and your son was embarrassed, but were you also embarrassed?
Participant:
Yes, but I don't, we don’t really have many people over because of the stuff.
Interviewer : Right. Has there ever been a time where you had more people over?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer : Right. Okay, so, how about any of your work relationships? Has it ever impacted anything like that?
Participant:
No, no I don’t think so.
