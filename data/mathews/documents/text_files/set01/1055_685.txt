Interviewer (30:29): Gotcha. Okay, so you consider yourself to have hoarding disorder then?
Participant:
Right.
Interviewer (30:36): Right. Okay so where do you get information about hoarding disorder? Where did you first hear about it?
Participant:
On the internet.
Interviewer (30:47): Okay. Any other places?
Participant:
No.
Interviewer (30:51): Gotcha. And, did this come about because, you know, you're curious about your own behavior, or something else?
Participant:
Me to define my own behavior and look for help.
Interviewer (31:05): Gotcha. So, this was kind of like when you were seeking that psychiatrist you mentioned earlier then?
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer (31:13): Gotcha. Okay, so, have you ever met anybody else who has hoarding disorder, other than your mother?
Participant:
Um, I have a friend that’s a hoarder, yes.
Interviewer (31:27): Okay. So, how can you tell?
Participant:
When you can't walk very well in her house. Everything is according to her, and everything is sentimental, and anything anybody’s ever given to her she keeps.
Interviewer (31:47): Right. So, were there any clues about her having hoarding disorder, or was it just from being in her home that you are able to realize that?
Participant:
It’s from being in her own home.
Interviewer (32:01): Okay, so you don't think there's any sort of personality traits that people with hoarding disorder tend to show?
Participant:
Not that I know of.
Interviewer (32:10): Right. Okay, so, did you after seeing your friend's home, did anything like click into place or suddenly makes sense about her?
Participant:
Well, after seeing her house then I could kind of— like I should’ve known
Interviewer (32:37): Okay. So, why do you feel that you should have known?
Participant:
Well, just from talking to her. That everything is important to her.
Interviewer (32:48): So, she verbalizes that a lot, that things are important?
Participant:
Yes. 
Interviewer (32:53): Gotcha. So, what kinds of things would she usually say are important?
Participant:
Anything anybody has given her, anything that has been someone else’s, and she has, uh… 
Interviewer (33:18): Alright, sorry I thought you were saying something she had. Okay, so, everything people have given her is important. So, how about for you? Does that differ from your own behavior or your own values?
Participant:
Well, I know I can’t keep everything everybody’s given me. I’ve realized that. Eventually when it becomes a problem, um…
Interviewer (33:47): Right. So, was there ever a point in your life where, you know, your hoarding behaviors were more severe than they are now?
Participant:
Yes, uh, when my son was alive we had a half of the living room and one of the bedrooms. I kept every little toy that he ever had. So, one of the bedrooms could not be used because you couldn’t walk in there.
Interviewer (34:17): Right. Was this a different house than the one we were talking about earlier?
Participant:
Yes, it was.
