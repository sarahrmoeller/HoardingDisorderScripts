Interviewer:
Yeah, actually. Yeah. The last part, actually, we're going to go ahead and collect some demographic and payment information.
Participant 011:
I don't need another gift card. Talk about hoarding, I have a dozen of these things. Not from you guys but from everybody else. And some of these cards I've never even used so I don't even know what's on them. I hate gift cards. I got them all over the place and I don't know how much money is on them. Then you got to call Visa or MasterCard and find out. That's another thing that bothers me. So yeah, if I could just have it added on to the card that I got from the previous study I did, that would be delightful.
Interviewer:
Okay. Let me go ahead and collect your demographics and payment information real quick, just to be sure.
Participant 011:
Sure, sure. Let's go over this.

Participant 011:
Right now, about 65, 75 grand a year.
Interviewer:
Okay. And what is your geographic region right now?
Participant 011:

Interviewer:
No, I'm actually in California as well.
Participant 011:
Oh my God. So then you can commiserate. My ex-wife is down there in Sebastopol watching all the vineyards burn up as she says. This is so horrible. Anyway, I was born in California so I know all about that.
Interviewer:
Yeah. And what is your highest level of education?
Participant 011:

Interviewer:
And was that for your bachelor's?
Participant 011:
Yeah, I got the bachelor's. I started in Miami, but I never finished it.
Interviewer:
Okay. And-
Participant 011:
I think I went five years ago and I never got my master's because I didn't do my thesis.
Interviewer:
Okay. And do you-
Participant 011:
I guess I'm becoming cluttered with phones too, to tell you the truth.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 011:
I got too many phones and too many numbers in my head. Too many of this and too many of that.
Interviewer:
And do you have a preference-
Participant 011:
Hear the doves in the background, do you?
Interviewer:
Yeah, I do.
Participant 011:
That's not a tape. Those are live.
Interviewer:
Oh, yeah. Do you have a preference for a physical or electronic gift card, just to be sure?
Participant 011:
Well, what's the one I got right now? It's a Visa debit card, I think it is. Yeah. It's a Bank of America Visa debit card, the one you got.
