Interviewee:
Yeah, or even if people come in and they're not trying to take anything away, to judge me on something as if it's a superficial thing, and not really realizing that it's a much deeper thing, and the risk of being judged is mentally unstable, that a piece of driftwood might be so important to me.
I'm not far from mentally unstable, but there is something maybe a little bit weird about me.
Interviewer:
There's something a little weird about everyone, though.
Interviewee:
So true, so true.
Interviewer:
That's what makes life interesting.
That brings me to the end of all the questions that I have for you relating to hoarding disorder.
Do you have any questions or anything that you'd like to further discuss?
Interviewee:
I'm curious about your goal in life in regards to your interactions with people and maybe your livelihood.

Yeah, I'd be very happy to let you know what I'm pursuing.
Do you mind if I ask you a few just paperwork questions real quick, and then I can discuss with you further?

Sure.
