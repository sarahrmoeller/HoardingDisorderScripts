Interviewer:
All right.
How has it impacted your overall physical health?
Interviewee:
Maybe a little worse because of having nothing better to do I smoke more.
Interviewer:
Okay, and what about your mental health or wellbeing?
Interviewee:
I don't think it's had that much of an effect.
Maybe a little bit more acting like a hermit, but I always was kind of a hermit.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Has it affected you or your family financially?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you found any specific techniques during COVID that you found helpful because of clutter?
Interviewee:
No, nothing special.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Let's see.
Have you sought treatment, resources or some kind of professional support during COVID?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
We talked about motivation to keep these items.
How have you kept in contact with family and friends during this time?
Interviewee:
I've got a couple friends that I will go out and eat with maybe once a week.
And I spend a lot of time on the computer, especially on Facebook.
I talk to everybody on Facebook all the time, but I haven't traveled anywhere.
There's only just a few people that I would go out and eat with because I don't want to be around most people.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
No, of course, yeah.
Have the other people living with you changed during COVID?
Interviewee:
Nobody lives with me.
I live alone.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Did you feel socially isolated or lonely before COVID happened?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Has that changed now?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you experienced any conflict during COVID 19?
Perhaps the measures?
Interviewee:
You mean like ordering the people in wearing a mask?
Interviewer:
Okay.
Yeah.
That's good.
Interviewee:
That's mentally an issue, yes.
I get very upset with people that won't wear one.
