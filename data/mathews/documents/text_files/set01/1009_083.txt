Interviewer:
So, before we begin, I have a few demographic questions I would like to ask you.
What is your sex assigned at birth?
Participant 009:
Female.
Interviewer:
What gender do you identify as?
Participant 009:
Female.
Interviewer:
Your racial identification?
Participant 009:
White.
Interviewer:
Are you Hispanic or Latino?
Participant 009:
No. Interviewer:
What is your highest degree or level of school you've completed?
Participant 009:
Highest degree would be high school.
Interviewer:
What is your household income?
I have ranges so you don't have to me exact.
So, I have up to 9,999 and then 10,000 to 19,999, and it goes on like that in 10,000 increments.
Participant 009:
Around 100,000 a year for myself and my husband.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Which geographic region best describes where you live in the US, Northeast, Midwest, South and West?
Participant 009:
Northwest.
Interviewer:
As you know, this study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.
The first question would be what term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 009:
Say that again?
Interviewer:
What term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding.
Participant 009:
Term, hm.
I guess I'm kind of a keeper.
Interviewer:
A keeper?
Okay.
Participant 009:
Keep things, yes.
Interviewer:
So, this next part of the interview, I call it more conversation style.
So, we're just going to be talking about how long you've been keeping things and your behaviors.
So, can you please describe how long you've been keeping things, like how long it's been going on and when it started?
Participant 009:
It probably started in, I would say, my mid to late 20s.
Once I got to the point where I had established my own space and was reasonably settled in where I lived, and then what happened was I just started accumulating things.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, it didn't start until you go your own place?
Participant 009:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
So, how severe would you say your behavior is now?
Participant 009:
It's bad enough that I'm concerned about it.
It's not as bad as some other people I know.
I had actually been in someone's house where literally you had paths that you had to go through to get from one space to another and little clearings.
I have my public rooms I keep reasonably clear, but you do not want to go into my study, my garage, my closets, places like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Can you describe what those spaces look like?
Participant 009:
The cluttered spaces?
Interviewer:
Yeah, and even other spaces.
