Interviewer:
Okay. So, you have maybe bought a couple of...
Maybe you've bought more food than you would normally, but not so much that it's going bad?
Interviewee:
Well, yeah.
I did buy a little extra for just in case I wouldn't be able to buy it in the future.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like the situation has impacted you in terms of your anxiety?
Interviewee:
Well, yeah, because, well, it has an impact financially a little bit.
Interviewer:
So, there's been a financial impact that's made it harder for you to meet your obligations with paying for the space to save your items.
Is that right?
Interviewee:
Oh. Well, if you want to put it that way...
Interviewer:
Yeah.
No, no. I guess what I'm trying to ask about is if you feel like things with your clutter have changed since COVID got started.
It doesn't sound like you've really been getting more stuff.
It doesn't sound like-
Interviewee:
Well, no. I try to avoid buying too much physical items anyway.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
It sounds like most of the things that you have are old, and it's not like you go out and buy new things or find new things and bring them into your apartment.
Is that right?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
It's mostly stuff that you already had or that you've had for a long time, or that come from your family.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Are there new things coming into your apartment?
Interviewee:
I just want to have that stuff organized, and then once I've gone through it, I won't need to keep it myself.
Interviewer:
But you're not adding to those items at all?
Interviewee:
No. Now, a few years ago I went to some flea markets and things and bought some extra, but-
Interviewer:
These days, you're not really doing that?
Interviewee:
I have a friend who is into art, who collects paintings, so a couple of years ago I went to her place and I bought a few of those, but I don't necessarily... I can't really use paintings and art myself, so I will tend to avoid buying any more of that anyway.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
So, a few years ago you acquired some paintings, but they aren't really useful for you, so you don't plan on acquiring any more?
Interviewee:
Right, because now I only have it for the chance of reselling it, and then there's that other thing of if I can make a profit.
Interviewer:
Right, but it sounds like these days it's less of an issue for you.
You're not thinking about reselling things as much as you used to.
Interviewee:
Or at least not buying anything new to try to resell.
