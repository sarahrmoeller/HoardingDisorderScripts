Interviewer:
What does hoarding disorder look like?
Participant 020:
I think it's more of a continuum, in the same way that I've come to understand autism is.
I think my brother, William, is very far along the continuum.
I don't know what end of the continuums would be, whether it would be the kind of person who lives in a house full of stacks of newspapers.
I had a friend, Fred, who, when he died, his kids found that he had hoarded tons and tons of food in a closet that rats and things had gotten into.
That's what I call the extreme end of it.
The other end is somebody like my sister-in-law who doesn't like having anything extraneous.
I think I probably fall a little bit past the middle towards the end of hoarder, but I think if 101 is 1 and 50 is the middle, I'm probably somewhere between 60 and 75.
I've gotten a lot better.
I think I was a lot worse a few years ago.
Interviewer:
Do you have any sources of information about hoarding disorder?
Have you ever read or seen anything about it?
Participant 020:
I don't... I get lots of internet resource.
I've watched a few episodes of those programs on TV about it, and I didn't find those very helpful, primarily because all those people were getting tons of help, and I've had to do most of this stuff myself.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 020:
But I have done a lot of reading about it, and I've certainly, in all the years since I had to recognize that I was an alcohol and then began to realize that I belong to Al Anon and ACA and CoDA and Debtors Anonymous and every other 12-step program, practically, I began realizing that addiction is kind of addiction.
Those components of things you can get help for, in the sense of comfort, but you need to make the inner decisions yourself about do you really want to do something about it?
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
So you-
Participant 020:
One of the things I've really been noticing during this stay at home, too, is that something in me really has changed in the last couple of years, because when I look at all the things that I have around me... I have a yard and stuff like that... when I first came here, I couldn't have faced getting rid of a lot of them.
Now, I really can.
Now, I don't know that I have the physical energy to do everything I'd like to do, but I could face it emotionally, I think.
Interviewer:
So when you-
Participant 020:
I don't know what's made the difference.
Interviewer:
That's amazing.
I mean, it sounds like it's been a lot of hard work, to reflect back.
Participant 020:
INAUDIBLE That's for sure.
