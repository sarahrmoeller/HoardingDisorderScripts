Interviewer:
Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. At the same time, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he's usually late in getting to where he needs to be. So in your opinion, does this person have hoarding disorder-
Participant 1:
Yes.
Interviewer:
... or clutter problems?
Participant 1:
Clutter.
Interviewer:
Clutter. Okay.
Participant 1:
Not hoarding.
Interviewer:
Not hoarding.
Participant 1:
Well, maybe a bit of both because he's saving clothes for if he needs them, and I do that.
Interviewer:
Okay. Uh-huh (affirmative).
Participant 1:
I mean, I have seven Patagonia jackets because I love Patagonia jackets. Do I wear them all? No. I don't wear them all. They sit in there and I try to rotate them. But I have a closet. I have two closets. I have one here and one up there and I periodically get rid of stuff. What my problem is, there's pairs of jeans on the floor that need to be patched and I need to embroider the patches and that takes a long time and I haven't had the time, so the stuff sits on the floor. That kind of thing. That kind of thing. But, no. I'm not late because I can't find things and get out of the house. I mean, no. 
Interviewer:
Of course. Okay.
Participant 1:
I try not to be late for anything. That's a pet peeve of mine.
Interviewer:
That's great. Okay. Let's see ... oh, here. Should this person try to change their behavior in your opinion?
Participant 1:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 1:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And does the behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist in your opinion?
Participant 1:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. And could you tell me why or ...
Participant 1:
Because he's always late and that's not good. I mean, that's an indication ... that's a problem with ... that creates a ... god, I can't give you the words I want to use.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Like a life disturbance, maybe?
Participant 1:
Well, it's opinions that people make about you based on your behavior and if you're late all the time, you're going to be looked on as a flake.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Okay. So yeah. Like a life disturbance type of thing, is [crosstalk 00:22:26].
Participant 1:
A life disturbing, yeah. Because if he's applying for jobs or he's going to an interview or he has to be at work on time and you're late all the time, you're going to get fired. So when it causes life changing decisions, then you got a real problem. Like drinking. Like drinking.
