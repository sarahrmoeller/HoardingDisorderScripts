Some of it I would've done anyway about the cleaning out my clothes closet, straightening things, going through some of my stuff and boxing them, so there was another time I did box stuff that was kitchen things, extra kitchen things that I hadn't used for a long time, to thrift, and that wasn't so hard because I don't have a lot of sentimental attachment to kitchen things.
I could easily look at them and go, "Oh, I haven't used this for two years.
Why is it still in the drawer?
Okay, you're gone."
Because I have two others that I might use, you know what I mean?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
I also do not have a sentimental attachment to my kitchen items, so I can understand that.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Anyway, so that was useful, and that helped me put some perspective on my tendencies.
At that point, I already had some perspective, but I shared it with a stranger who I really liked, this coach person, and it was interesting to share that and talk about it each week.
Interviewer:
Yeah, it seems like that's probably the most uncomfortable portion of it for you, so I'm glad that you were able to find someone that you felt was comfortable to just air whatever you wanted to with.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Yeah, but I would never invite her to my house.
Interviewer:
Baby steps.
Okay, so as now, during this time where you're spending maybe a little bit more time at home, has it made you feel more connected to the items in your house, since you're looking at them more often and around them?
Interviewee:
No, it's actually made me feel like it's time to trade them out, and maybe even to decide if I can get rid of some of them, possibly.
I'd definitely trade them out because I have a box or more upstairs in my studio of things I haven't looked at for quite a while, and this would be a good time to get them out and look at them and remember things, so yeah, definitely in my living room I have these kind of mantle cubbyhole things that I designed when we renovated our living room, so I could put my treasures in them.
I have not actually been seeing them for some months.
I'm looking at them now, and they make me happy, but yeah.
Interviewer:
I like that you use, whenever you described it to me, when you first described this concept of having items and really enjoying the uniqueness and the aesthetic view of them collectively, whenever you use them as decoration, but it gets to a certain point, I think in anyone's home probably too, where you do stop seeing them.
They become invisible, in a sense, because you're so used to them.
That's an interesting concept.
Interviewee:
Right.
Yep.
Interviewer:
I need to redecorate my place, now that you say that.
