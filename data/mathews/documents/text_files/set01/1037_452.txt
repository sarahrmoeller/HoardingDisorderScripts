Interviewer:
All right.
So as you know this study is investigating individual attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.
The first question would be, what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter or difficulties with discarding?
Participant 37:
I think when my wife and I and friends talk about it I think we refer to it as being a hoarder.
What other terms were there because I know it's been fresh on our minds but not because of your study but because I'm actually decluttering but I think hoarding is probably what we talk about.
Interviewer:
Okay, so hoarding, problems with hoarding.
Some patients prefer difficulties with clutter or clutter problems but if you prefer hoarding we can use that.
Participant 37:
No, hoarding's good.
Interviewer:
Okay, perfect.
So the Interviewer is broken up into two sections.
So the first section is about making lists and then the second section is more a conversation.
So first I'm going to ask you to make some lists.
So for this section it's about if I were to ask you to make a grocery list you would say, "Eggs, bread, cheese," something like that.
So that's how I would like you to answer these first couple questions.
Time is not an issue.
You can take as long as you'd like.
The idea is to get as good and long a list as possible but it's really important that you keep your answers short and concise, just like a list.
Participant 37:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay, perfect.
So the first prompt is, please list all the things that might contribute to the development of hoarding disorder.
Participant 37:
Hmm, parental example.
Perhaps events in my life where I didn't get something so that I'm, at this point I want it.
I'll continue to want that thing more than naturally INAUDIBLE people.
Loving inanimate objects too much and wanting to keep them.
The social encouragement of collecting and maybe wanting to have something that somebody else doesn't have.
And I don't know is that a good list?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So, so far we have parental examples, events in your life where you didn't get something so now you want it, loving inanimate objects and wanting to keep them, social encouragement for collecting and wanting something that someone else doesn't have.
Would that be-
Participant 37:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
I think that's a pretty good, perhaps part of what's driven me.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay, that's great and if you think of anything else we can always come back to any of these questions.
So the second question is, please list all the reasons that you keep things.
Participant 37:
I did mention some.
Interviewer:
Right.
If you can think of any CROSSTALK other things.
Participant 37:
Well I think also to remind me of an event, perhaps.
So, can I give you an example or you just want the list?
