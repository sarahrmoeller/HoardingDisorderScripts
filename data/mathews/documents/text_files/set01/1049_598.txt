The dining room, a long time ago, I gave away my dining room table and chairs, so the dining room is like a staging area, and it is stacks of boxes and containers, that was put in there since we started working. The living room is still piles, because we haven't reached it yet. And essentially, the bedrooms, one of them, you can't really get into right now. The other one, I used to use as a computer office. It has little trails. There's a desk, and the bedroom has a trail to the bathroom, and over to the bed.
Interviewer:
Okay. What would you like your home to look like?
Participant 49:
Well, of course, the ones in the magazines. Well, I would like it to look inviting. I would like it to look like, if somebody came to the door, and I asked them to come in, it would like an interesting, comfortable place to live. 
I don't mind ... I have so many books. So there's shelves full of books, and ... And by the way, I gave away 1000 books a couple of years ago, but of course, you just get more back. You buy more. So I don't mind them seeing a lot of things, if they're relatively neat, and it looks like they're stored in some sort of neat, organized way.
I don't want them to just see a dining room full of boxes. I don't want that, but I don't mind if some knitting projects or needlepoint projects are placed in some kind of containers to organize them in the living room, because that's where I'm doing the work. So I don't feel like I have to hide stuff away like that, you know?
Interviewer:
Sure.
Participant 49:
So, a little bit more comfortable than the magazine rooms. Not quite so empty as they are, but floor space and places to sit without moving things. A nice, neat kitchen, where you think it's safe to eat the food that's produced there. 
Interviewer:
So, you talked about how you have a lot of books and a lot of needlework and stuff like that. How important are these things to you?
Participant 49:
How important are my things?
Interviewer:
Yeah. 
Participant 49:
I think they're pretty important. Like the jigsaw puzzles, which I have quite a number of, and of course, they're in the boxes. That's the easiest thing to neatly put away. But they're probably ... I haven't let any go, but I could. But I might, maybe having a table to do it on keeps me from letting them go. So they're like, lowest on the totem pole of importance, even though I still have them.
