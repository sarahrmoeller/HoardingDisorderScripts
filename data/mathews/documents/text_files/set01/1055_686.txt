Interviewer: Gotcha. So, that house was more severely hoarded than the one now, right?
Interviewee:
Right, but the one we have now is a good bit bigger.
Interviewer: Right. So, is there any particular reason you bought it bigger?
Interviewee:
Well, for all of the belongings.
Interviewer: Right. So, would you say that hoarding contributed to you wanting to buy a bigger house?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Gotcha. Alrighty, so, I'm going to jump back a little bit back to kind of talking about hoarding disorder in general. So, when you hear the words “hoarding disorder,” what do you think about? Do you have any sort of like values assigned to that, or like any negative or positive connotations that come to mind?
Interviewee:
No, because I kinda understand.
Interviewer: Right. So, it's pretty neutral for you to hear those words?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer: Right. And, I could kind of tell by the way that you didn't have a problem with, you know, just calling it hoarding disorder in the very beginning. So, for you, it's more just like a fact sort of thing?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Okay. So, now we're going to talk a little bit more about how hoarding disorder has interfered with your life. So, I know we, we kind of touched earlier on how it's created some conflict with your husband, and kind of prevented you from seeing certain people or having certain people over. So, I want to ask whether your behavior upsets you?
Interviewee055
Yes.
Interviewer: Okay, and why would you say it upsets you the most?
Interviewee:
Well, you know, because it affects your whole life. Um, there’s so many things you, um…. It just seems like there’s so much stuff and it’s just in the way. But you’re not able to do very much about it.
Interviewer: So, you feel kind of helpless then?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Alright. And, do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer: Okay. So, in what ways does it affect your day to day life?
Interviewee:
Well, it’s just, you’re so busy dealing with all the stuff that you can’t really have a life.
Interviewer: Alright. And when you say dealing with the stuff, what does that mean?
Interviewee:
Well, when I’m at my mom’s I am trying to deal with all of this stuff. Because, you know, she’s coming to the end of her life and something has to be done. And, and I just can't get through it very fast.
Interviewer: Mhmm. So, the going through her possessions and seeing what we need to get rid of, that is what's most interfering with your daily life?
Interviewee:
Yes, it would be nice if I was not having to sleep on a couch, because the couch is not very comfortable.
Interviewer: Definitely not as good as a bed. I could, I could imagine.
