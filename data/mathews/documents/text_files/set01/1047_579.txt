Interviewee47:
That's a good question.
That's a really good question.
I hope not.
I hope not.
I don't know.
That's kind of like trying to look at me from the outside.
Maybe because I'm kind of insecure, because there's an insecurity to it.
I don't know for everyone, but I think that's a generalization maybe that there's an insecurity.
There's a vulnerability.
Maybe a little bit up and downish with the moods, but I'm not sure if that [INAUDIBLE] everyone or not, but I think it's a psychological problem.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee47:
So if somebody looks a little bit off balance, you might think, I wonder what that entails.
Maybe things aren't up to snuff in their house.
I don't really ...
When I see a person on the street, I can't really see that.
Interviewer:
You don't just think, oh that's hoarding disorder.
It's difficult, yeah.
Interviewee47:
I was at work as a nurse, and I don't think people saw that in me.
At work, I was very tidy and clean.
I don't think people realize, people I don't have as close friends, that my house was a big mess.
Although, some of the nurses I worked with said, "My kitchen is terrible.
I clean more at work than I do here," because it seemed like we spent more time at work.
Interviewer:
Right, yeah.
Interviewee47:
So I don't think people can see that automatically, but I don't know.
I think if a person is kind of falling apart at the seams in other ways, you might maybe wonder if they're finding their security elsewhere.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay.
So where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Where have you heard of it before?
Interviewee47:
Well, after I kind of realized I had it, I just looked it up on the internet.
I've taken psychology classes.
I've gone to counseling.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee47:
I just looked it up there.
Interviewer:
Okay, so the internet definitely was one of your sources.
Interviewee47:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So is there-
Interviewee47:
I got a book on it too.
There were different degrees and they showed pictures and stuff like that.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Okay.
My last question for you is what do you think of when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee47:
Oh, just really bad, super bad looking house and a person who's kind of messed up inside.
They're messed up so their house is messed up.
Their house kind of represents their brain kind of, just cluttered and just-
Interviewer:
That's interesting.
Interviewee47:
Oh, you're working from home.
Interviewer:
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
Interviewee47:
Of course, everyone is now.
Interviewer:
That's my dog.
I'm so sorry.
Interviewee47:
No, no. I'm glad you're still able to ...
Well, you're not working ... you're working at school.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
