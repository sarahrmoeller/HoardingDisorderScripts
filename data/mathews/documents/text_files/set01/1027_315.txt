Participant 27:
There's a lot of bedrooms that are used for my hoarding stuff, but they are also not used because I don't have anybody sleeping here. All of the bathrooms are clear and we use them all. Actually, we might be putting another bathroom on as well. 
Interviewer:
Okay, added with the sunroom? 
Participant 27:
Yes. My significant other has Parkinson's with a little dementia, and I have the gene for Alzheimer's, so our intent is to make this into our nursing home and to bring in a caregiver if we need to. I'm just trying to make things handicap accessible for a wheelchair for when that point comes. 
Interviewer:
Other than making your home more handicap accessible and more of this nursing home esque place, is there anything that is different about how your home is now and what you would like your home to look like? 
Participant 27:
I do a lot for the Coast Guard, and like I said, I have a lot of paperwork and I save a lot of things like Alzheimer's research, all of the stuff that I get from you guys that are the consent forms and all that kind of stuff. What I would like... The reason I purchased these three other filing cabinets, which by the way were at the yard sale for $10 each... I have a lot of papers that are in bins like the consent forms and Coast Guard stuff. I would like to put them into the filing cabinets, but we have a very active life. We're always doing a lot of things that are very interesting and making memories, and we have a nine-month-old puppy, so I find that I really don't have the time to concentrate on organizing the paperwork and putting it where it should be. 
Interviewer:
Gotcha. 
Participant 27:
That I would like to change. I would like to get the piles of stuff off the floors and out of laundry baskets and into these filing cabinets. That is an intent that I have. 
Interviewer:
Okay, that makes sense, putting things into filing cabinets and getting them off of the floor. Kind of switching gears and thinking about the possessions themselves... I know we talked about some things are valuable because of the memories that they have. How do you determine... If there's any criteria other than that or things that people might use in the future, how do you determine if an object is valuable or not? 
Participant 27:
The memory I think is the most important thing. Another thing is whether it is pleasing to me to look at it. For instance, I really like the little Fisher-Price toys and things, and they do have a memory, but I also think it's pretty cool. I like Minions. My kids didn't have Minions growing up. They really don't have any memory associated with them, but I just think that they're cute. I like things that are cute and colorful.
