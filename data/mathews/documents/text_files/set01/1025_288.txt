Interviewee:
Just maybe sadness, because it's a reminder to me of my grandmother.
It just represents a lot of what she was about.
It would just be kind of, I don't know, beyond that.
I don't know that it would be life altering, because there were things in my grandmother's house that I wish I had and I didn't get them, and I'm okay without them.
It's just neat to have keepsakes to me it is, it's neat to have these little reminders of my grandparents that are gone before me.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
In a way, I don't know if this thought has ever occurred to you before, but looking at the item and if it's something that's useful to you, knowing that you kept the item in the family for both sentimental reasons and also it serves a purpose, so everything around you can provide comfort in a way, because you know that it's reducing waste, as well as has meaning.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
It sounds like whenever you think about discarding items it doesn't cause you any extreme amount of stress or anxiety when thinking about getting rid of items, it's just more it's something that you have to actually think of to do.
Interviewee:
It's hard for me to make that dent, but once I do I always feel free.
Yeah.
It's hard for me to actually put stuff in a box, put it in the car and drive somewhere and leave it, but once I do it's very freeing.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What makes it difficult to do that in the first place?
Interviewee:
I'm always second guessing.
"Am I going to regret this?
Am I going to wish I had it back?" Or, "Maybe it's not going to be put to good use."
That's probably one of my biggest things, I don't know why.
So what if somebody else throws it in the trash?
I'll never know it.
I take comfort in knowing that someone else is going to use something that was useful to me.
Interviewer:
Okay.
It doesn't link to anything external, like worrying about the environmental repercussions, it's more just knowing that an item that was useful to you still has value.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That's interesting.
Interviewee:
It's crazy, I know.
Interviewer:
It's not crazy.
I tend to look at my items and I feel very similarly to what you say.
I think it's just, I often wonder if I had more time, if I would accumulate more items because sentimental purposes as well as use is often a reason that I keep things.
I've had to move almost every year being in the college age.
