Interviewer:
Okay. The last one yet.
John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they're valuable.
He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.
He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.
Antiques occupy every room.
Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.
Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so that he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he is looking for.
He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
Okay.
Do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Participant 010:
What did you say he collected again?
Interviewer:
Antique items.
Something valuable.
Participant 010:
Antiques.
I would say it's excessive, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think that this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Participant 010:
Probably not.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How come?
Participant 010:
Well, you would hope that you could sit him down and explain, showing him how much money he's wasting and he would be able to accept that he's spending too much money and quit.
He might need a psychologist.
I don't know about a psychiatrist.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah.
Is this behavior similar or different from yours?
Participant 010:
I think it's different.
I don't really keep anything thinking I can sell it later.
I mean, there might be an occasional like that, but not anything that I collect.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Is there anything else that you want to add about your clutter or about how it's affected you?
Participant 010:
Again, mine is mostly a problem of not being able to hire somebody to come in and help me clean.
I'm not able to health wise to do it myself.
Everything is bad because I really can't clean.
I can't vacuum floors and bend over to pick up stuff and all that.
Mine is mostly a money issue I think.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Perfect.
This is it for the interview questions.
I'm going to stop the recording if there's nothing else to add.
Give me a second.
