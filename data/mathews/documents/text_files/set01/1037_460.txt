Participant 37:
So, you see that's the problem.
I got rewarded for hoarding.
Interviewer:
Right, so yeah you've been like an entrepreneur with all of your items so, I mean...
Participant 37:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 37:
You know it gives me obviously a mixed message.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
But I think, like I said, I don't... and even after I sold that there were some things that I bought.
I bought a set of Addams Family trading cards, the TV show from the 60s, because I always watch it and I acquired that, I'm ready to get rid of it, you know, I got it, okay I got it now who cares, right?
I guess I was still acquiring between now and 20 years ago but it was limited to a few things I guess that were high on my list of things that I needed to have, needed was in quotes for the transcript.
Interviewer:
Right.
Okay, so in this moment in time do you think you have too much stuff even after decluttering a little bit?
Participant 37:
Definitely.
Interviewer:
So how do you decide when you have too much?
Participant 37:
I've been at that point.
When will I not have too much I think would be a better question and that is what I'm INAUDIBLE to sell.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
INAUDIBLE how I feel about it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 37:
I'm not near that, however, is it a finite?
Do I see the light at the end of the tunnel?
The tunnel is a few miles long.
I'm not sure how many years it'll take me or how focused I have to be.
I guess I'm fairly efficient and I can try to price things low so people will buy them.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 37:
We'll see.
Interviewer:
Okay, well that sounds good.
Okay, so now we're going to move on to another section and it's about distinguishing hoarding disorder.
What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?
Participant 37:
I think that it would have to be what would be considered a reasonable amount of things that you have accumulated so if you look into somebody's garage and they have 10 packages of paper towels I would say okay they're hoarding, pandemic aside.
Interviewer:
Right, right.
Participant 37:
Nothing to do with the pandemic because I've seen some of my neighbors garages.
Right now we have one and a half packages of paper towels and that's only because they were free and I didn't go out of my way to get them.
Interviewer:
Well free is good.
Participant 37:
INAUDIBLE I guess if you have more things than you can use by the expiration date then you have a problem.
Is that a good enough answer or do you need something more?
Interviewer:
No, if that's what you believe then... there's no right or wrong answers.
