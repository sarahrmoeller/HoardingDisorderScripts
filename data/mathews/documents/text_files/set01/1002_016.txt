Interviewer:
Okay, all right. Next question, please describe where you live now, do you live alone?
Participant 2:
Right now I'm living with my parents, because I didn't have a job for a few years and my health went down hill. But I'm working again, but my health's still a mess, and my current job doesn't pay as much, so I'm waiting to get to where I can earn enough to move out on my own again.
Interviewer:
Okay, and are there parts of your home that you consider cluttered? What makes them cluttered?
Participant 2:
My room is a disaster area, the rest of the house is... My parents control it, so when I was living by myself the whole place was cluttered.
Interviewer:
Are there parts of your room that you don't use because of the clutter?
Participant 2:
Well, I mean, instead of putting my laundry away, I just put a basket on the floor, and I use it. Then I put the dirty stuff in my laundry bag, and keep the clean stuff in the laundry basket when I could just put it in the dresser, and so that's an example. I have a bunch of cables and things from things that are plugged in, the cables could be organized better. A lot of different boxes and things that need to be cleaned out and put in the closet, a lot of papers and files. I have a hard time with filing things, so I always have papers everywhere.
Interviewer:
Okay, all right, perfect, thank you. Let me see, next question, when you think of your possessions, what makes them valuable? How do you determine if an object has value or not?
Participant 2:
For me if it's anything that... I collect books and things that are like, and anything relating to Star Wars, or whatever. But also, I'll save anything that I've ever written, like all my school stuff, so those I all value. Because of my health, I've been learning to that I have to save all my medical records. I've got lots of DVDs, Blu-ray discs [crosstalk 00:14:48].
Interviewer:
What would be trash for you? What do you think?
Participant 2:
Let's see...
Interviewer:
How do you know it's time to throw something away?
Participant 2:
Well, for me, if its wrappers or if its... I'm trying to think of the word. When I recycle, I recycle junk mail, I recycle boxes.
Interviewer:
Would you say that recyclables are something... 
Participant 2:
I throw food away. 
Interviewer:
Throw food away, okay.
Participant 2:
I eat food but I don't waste food, but I mean scraps or whatever. I don't really have a garbage bin in my room, I have a recycling bin in my room, because our garbage bin we have is in the kitchen.
Interviewer:
What is the most precious item in your house for you?
