Participant 30:
Yeah, I think induces a certain amount of stress. It's something that, it just seems like if I did straighten everything up, I have a feeling, it wouldn't be long before it was back to what it was before. 
Interviewer:
Now I'm going to ask a little bit about what you think are the most important differences between what someone might consider normal saving behavior, such as like a collector collecting certain items, and what is considered full blow hoarding disorder?
Participant 30:
I think that what most people would think of as a collector would be like a certain type of thing, and they're probably neatly displayed or cataloged, and in boxes maybe. I think full blown hoarding disorder means that you can't throw anything out, even food wrappers and having a lot of animals in the house, and not being able to clean up after them. 
Interviewer:
It sounds like you kind of associated a level of, or rather a lack of cleanliness with full blown hoarding disorder then?
Participant 30:
[inaudible 00:28:39] ...necessarily... I guess you could have a serious hoarding disorder, but not go to that... I think that would be the extreme. Like those would be the absolute extremes, and then in between, you've got a lot. I think I'd probably fall, I guess I think of hoarding as keeping things that have absolutely no use and that you couldn't explain why it's hard to get rid of it.
Interviewer:
How does hoarding disorder then similar or different from your own behavior?
Participant 30:
I think... I guess maybe it wouldn't be a disorder when it gets to the point where it interferes with your ability to function and live a life that doesn't have a lot of anxiety or stress. 
Interviewer:
When it becomes extremely distressing to the person with the problem?
Participant 30:
Yeah, sometimes I think maybe it's more distressing to the other people than to the person doing the hoarding. 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So you think maybe somebody with a full blown hoarding disorder, would have more of those conflicts that I was asking you about earlier?
Participant 30:
Yeah. I think [inaudible 00:30:57] ... probably other mental health issues involved. 
Interviewer:
What kinds of mental health issues would you assume that somebody with a full blown disorder might also have?
Participant 30:
Like anxiety, and fear of losing things, fear of loss.
Interviewer:
That kind of leads me to my next question then which is do you think there's a way to tell if somebody has hoarding disorder without being in their home? Might they display some sort of attributes or certain tendencies that might be a tell for you?
Participant 30:
I don't think so. I don't think you could... I don't think it's something that you could really tell just by seeing someone outside their own house.
Interviewer:
Have you ever known someone who maybe you suspected had some issues with clutter?
