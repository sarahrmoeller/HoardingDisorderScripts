Participant 26:
Well in her case, she would take things, like maybe she'd rip a piece off of say, a cereal box and put it under the bed. That kind of thing, she didn't have clutter in her house but there were certain things that she felt a compulsion to save and it would often go under her bed. Yeah, we thought that was funny.
Interviewer:
So she just had certain items that she couldn't help but saving?
Participant 26:
Right, and they had no meaning at all, but in her mind there was some rhyme or reason to it all.
Interviewer:
So there were just certain things she had to hang on to. 
Participant 26:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
So when you think about this disorder, do you think that you could tell somebody had it if you weren't able to look at their stuff? 
Participant 26:
Just by looking at the person, or knowing the person?
Interviewer:
Yeah if you met somebody.
Participant 26:
No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't know.
Interviewer:
Are there people in your life that you know have these sorts of problems or that you suspect have even just problems with clutter?
Participant 26:
My sister does big time actually.
Interviewer:
And how do you know that she has that problem, have you talked about it with her or is it from seeing her home? 
Participant 26:
No, when we've talked about it she'd say, "I'm so busy, I work and have kids, I can't deal with it." But she has mountains of paper on her dining room table, and her kitchen table, every surface, in the guest room, stacks on the floor of papers. And I think part of it is that she just chooses not to get to it because she's enjoying other things. There are certain things she saves like these silly flyers that she gets in the mail and things I know and she knows she'll never use, but she still feels a compulsion to look through everything that comes. 
Interviewer:
So you see this problem in her from looking at her stuff and being in her home?
Participant 26:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
And she recognizes it but she just is busy and has other things in her life that she's working on, does that sound right?
Participant 26:
Right, and also I believe she was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD in college. She actually went to Harvard and she was diagnosed in her senior year when she was having trouble taking her law reports for law school. 
Interviewer:
So you think that that plays into her problem with keeping things?
Participant 26:
I'm sorry?
Interviewer:
Do you think that the dyslexia plays in to her cluttering problems?
Participant 26:
I think so, because even talking to her she pivots on a dime, goes off on tangents and doesn't even finish the sentence, in the middle of a sentence she'll start a new thought. So I think that's a big part of it.
