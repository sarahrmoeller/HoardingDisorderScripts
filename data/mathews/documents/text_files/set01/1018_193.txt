Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. The newer photographs you think you can get rid of after you digitize them, but the older photographs you're going to continue to hang onto?
Participant 018:
Once I've digitized them, once they're organized, then I would intend to find a niece or nephew to hand them off to, if they'll take them.
Interviewer:
Okay, okay. Sure. So, you kind of plan to treat those, that organized collection, as an heirloom?
Participant 018:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer:
Those are so important to you because they're linked to memories from your family, or-
Participant 018:
Well, yes, and also, the antique value for the things that are 100 years old.
Interviewer:
So, things that are older, you mean antique value in the sense of money value or sentimental value?
Participant 018:
It's kind of a combination of both.
Interviewer:
Okay, okay. So, other than the letters that you mentioned, and the photographs, and again, please correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like the most important things that you own are all kind of older things that are linked to your family, linked to memories from your family, and also, just kind of objectively old and perhaps valuable. Does that sound right?
Participant 018:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer:
Again, this is just hypothetical, but what do you think would happen if those things were lost?
Participant 018:
Well, I did wind up losing a lot of things recently, things of value, although they weren't necessarily the antique ones. Well, if it was digitized, then I would be kind of okay because, well, at least I've got the information.
Interviewer:
But if they weren't digitized and you had lost them, you would be-
Participant 018:
Yeah. Then I'd just be anxious.
Interviewer:
It would make you anxious?
Participant 018:
For a while, I was afraid I had lost some film. It's possible that I did, but...
Interviewer:
If you had lost-
Participant 018:
... I'm at least trying to gather what I can for family history.
Interviewer:
Got it. So, if you had lost them before you digitized them, it would make you anxious that that part of your family history was lost?
Participant 018:
Right.
Interviewer:
And you would feel regret that you were unable to preserve those parts of your family's memory?
Participant 018:
Or something that could be of value, at least for me or someone else, and that has happened quite a bit.
Interviewer:
So, of value-
Participant 018:
But I'd still wind up just dealing with it, letting it go anyway.
Interviewer:
So, you've learned to kind of deal a little bit with that loss, but you still worry about-
Participant 018:
Yeah, because-
Interviewer:
Go ahead.
Participant 018:
... there's still going to be things that are going to...
Interviewer:
Be lost.
Participant 018:
... going to be lost like that. So, I would just have to let go.
