Interviewee:
I mean I really haven’t. I mean to me I’m not that bad.
Interviewer:
Ok so you’d say that you haven’t gone to a professional because you don’t think you’re that bad and because you think that in the future you’ll just have a room to yourself.
Interviewee:
Yeah. I talk myself out of it.
Interviewer:
Ok. And I know you mentioned that your father and brother; or your husband and brother react negatively to your behavior.
Interviewee:
No, no I mean you can tell sometimes when they got to walk around something or when they invite people over. Yeah I can feel it I’m ashamed. I kind of hurts they don’t want to do it here. And right away I don’t care who you are, first thing ill say to you when you come into my house is “hey I’m an Ebay seller, I’m an Etsy seller, this is my stuff. I have no office.” That’s my [UNCLEAR].
Interviewer:
Ok. So would you say you’ve had any conflicts with people about your behavior?
Interviewee:
No because I get you before you get me.
Interviewer:
Gotcha. So you immediately give them the excuse that you work for Ebay?
Interviewee:
Yes. And I do actually do.
Interviewer:
Right, right.
Interviewee:
And something people look at me like I didn’t even care. You know? But I want to get to you first.
Interviewer:
Ok. So now we’re moving on to the area where we’re going to explore your space and living area now. So you mentioned that you live with your husband and brother. Do you live with anybody else?
Interviewee:
No.
Interviewer:
Ok. And could you des-. So you said that most of your stuff is cluttered around where you are the most.
Interviewee:
Where I am yeah.
Interviewer:
right. So, basically if could describe the place you would say that it’s hard to walk around sometimes?
Interviewee:
Well let’s just put it for you this way. The only way to get to my space is one way. There’s this one little walk- [UNCLEAR] and one time he had a chair, a regular chair that I could sit in [UNCLEAR] the other side of me has this bookshelf with big things in it and its filled. I even added a whole new table beside it because I ran out of room on the table.  But there’s no room. My husband has his chair which is next to me, he could only go one way out. To go around the coffee table. So, I don’t know if I answered your question but there’s only one way in and out. Where I sit.
Interviewer:
No you answered it.
Interviewee:
It has all my stuff around it.
