Interviewee:
Fewer people come into the house, although a whole lot didn't come to begin with, but like there is somebody that comes in and cleans, and she was gone for two, three months, and now she just started to come back.
But I think we might have to put her on hiatus again because I'm not sure what she's bringing into the house when she comes.
Interviewer:
Right, so that unknown- it's scary.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So has the COVID-19 pandemic affected your acquiring habits, like including buying or acquiring free things or anything?
Interviewee:
I actually do think I’m shopping online more than I was.
Interviewer:
Yeah I agree with that, for myself.
So online shopping is definitely one of the things that has come up for you.
Interviewee:
Yeah, and maybe food hoarding for the household, like we’ve got a quarter of a  [INCOHERENT], but maybe that’s reasonable, I’m not sure.
But our freezer in the garage is packed, cabinets are all packed.
Interviewer:
Do you do that so you have to go to the grocery store less.
Like buying in bulk so you don’t have to go back as soon?
Interviewee:
That’s part of it, but I think it’s also just because of feeling more insecure generally and having a surplus is somehow comforting.
Interviewer:
Okay, and how has COVID-19 affected your difficulties with discarding and clutter?
Interviewee:
Because I can’t go out, or I don't go out and distract myself with other things.
And then in the house, perhaps more than usual, I put it in my face a little bit more (?).
Interviewer:
And you also mentioned reading books about organization, has COVID-19 affected your attempts to declutter, and have you had more time to organize?
Interviewee:
I have plenty of time- I did and I do, and I just haven’t done it.
Interviewer:
Okay, and has it impacted your overall physical health?
Interviewee:
I don’t think so.
Interviewer:
Okay, and has COVID-19 affected your overall mental health or well being?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, I'm having more bad dreams and just generalized anxiety.
Interviewer:
Right, and finally, how has COVID-19 affected you or your family financially?
Interviewee:
Probably not much.
I mentioned we were retired, so our income stream really hasn't changed.
Our tenants continue to pay their rent.
I think we're going out and not going out to eat and saving money that way.
On the other hand, there is more shopping but online shopping, but I think it kind of balances out.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Um, so we're finally in our last section and it's about COVID coping.
So how have you been coping since the start of the COVID pandemic?
Like, are there any specific techniques that you have found helpful with coping with your anxiety or your clutter?
