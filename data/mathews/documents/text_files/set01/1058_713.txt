Right. But to me that started out as collectors like slide pinball machines and someone, and now it's gone like scary. Like I don't know, and it scares me to think it disintegrates into that. Like could I do that eventually?
Interviewer:
okay so I was gonna ask you, like how do you feel about that show?
Participant:
It’s sad and it's scary because it didn't seem to unless this I think there’s two of them. I think there’s hoarders and there hoarding. I think there's two different ones, but to me it initially was kind of neat because it started out as collectors then it seemed to disintegrate and I thought that they start out like that. I mean, Like to me what seems to start it. It's like you don't start cleaning up after your pet. And then they get another pet and then you don't clean your toilet. You know what I mean? Like do they start out like me then become like that? It's kind of scary.
Interviewer:
So, it scares you because it shows you like what potentially you could turn into maybe?
Participant:
Yeah, I mean, I don't think so. But I don't know. Cuz I don’t think the worst. they all seemed to have started out pretty UNCLEAR.
Interviewer:
Okay. So other than that hoarding TV show. Is there any other source of information on that you got your information from?
Participant:
No, not really.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, and then now we'll just move into our next section, which is about distress or interference. So, does your hoarding disorder; do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?
Participant:
Probably no
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, but does it upset you?
Participant:
Yeah, Yeah I don't like looking around here. Yeah.
Interviewer:
And does it just…Why does it upset you?
Participant:
Because I think eventually this has to be cleaned
My brother was left to cleaning up what was hoarded at their house. And I mean and plus my grandfather lived there. I mean, UNCLEAR To be at work. All right. I just found four anchors. And he was a draftsman, and then an uncle had moved in there and is… I mean we're talking dumpster after dumpster after dumpster. We're not talking like we're talking like rented five or six dumpsters.
Interviewer:
So it's just like that that like foreshadowing of having to clean all that up.
- Right, and that's why I rarely will bring anything in the basement is actually all his now where he had to end up cleaning. Mason jars just full of pickled items.
Interviewer:
Oh
Participant:
Oh no you can’t imagine what was in that house.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, and can you describe a time when you're recording disorder got in the way of something you really want it?
