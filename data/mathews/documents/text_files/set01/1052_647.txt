Interviewer (27:07): Okay, so mostly papers and records. Things like that?
Participant:
Yes. 
Interviewer (27:13): Okay, so how do you determine if those papers or those records are valuable?
Participant:
That’s been an issue. I have gone on periodic bouts of disposing of one banker’s box of documents at a time and occasionally make progress, occasionally lose my momentum on that.
Interviewer (27:44): Mhmm. So, when you do decide to throw some of these papers away, what usually goes through your mind when you’re trying to figure out what to discard or not?
Participant:
First, that HIPAA protected or financial information needs to burned, or it can be recycled because there isn’t confidential information. And then, if I’m thinking about retaining it, how would it be repurposed, or would it have been another matter?
Interviewer (28:24): Okay. Can you think of any examples where that happened? Where you were going to throw something away, but then thought it might be useful for something else?
Participant:
With the successful matters, I frequently hang onto the paperwork. Those who were involved will utilize it. And with the stuff with HIPAA or financial information, I have to bring that home, probably here for recycling and I oversee it [inaudible; (29:03)]. 
Interviewer (29:04): Right. So, with any of the papers of the records that you’ve kept with the anticipation of using them later, do you often use them later, or do you sometimes not use them?
Participant:
If I was confronted with the number of times that I’ve used what’s been saved, I would have to say out of the number of times that things have been saved, being reused is limited. 
Interviewer (29:35): Okay. So, the ratio of not using something to using something is pretty high.
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer (29:43): Okay. So, in terms of the items in your home, what’s most precious to you? So, outside of your office?
Participant:
At home, what’s most precious, I would say the human occupants. The um… there are a small number of rare documents left., There’s a small herd of musical instruments. 
Interviewer (30:23): Okay. What kinds of musical instruments?
Participant:
An amplifier and baseless guitars. 
Interviewer (30:30): Okay. And I know you mentioned earlier that some of these were broken. Were you including them when you were telling me that these were the most precious?
Participant:
The ones that are broken are less precious than them.
Interviewer (30:47): Okay. And why do you keep the broken ones around?
Participant:
Part of it is keeping them around to cannibalize for use on other instruments.
Interviewer (31:01): Okay, so you can like repurpose the parts and such?
Participant:
Yes, it is. 
Interviewer (31:08): Gotcha. And kind of like I asked earlier, how often do you actually find yourself repurposing these parts?
Participant:
About as often as the documents I’ve saved get reused. 
Interviewer (31:22): Gotcha. Okay, so, in your office then, what’s the most precious item?
Participant:
Probably the hard drive that’s the backup.
