Interviewee:
Do I start by room?
Do I start by objects such as cotton tee shirts?
Where do I start?
Interviewer:
So it goes back to that feeling of being overwhelmed and feeling trapped?
Interviewee:
Yes, and alone with the problem.
Interviewer:
Do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Interviewee:
It's a problem for me.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm 
Interviewee:
I don't know anyone else except my brother's wife who is the biggest slob I've ever encountered in my life.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm 
Interviewee:
I think she wouldn't notice, but anyone else I know would notice big time.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm 
Interviewee:
And that would make me very embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So it goes back to those feelings of shame and embarrassment?
Interviewee:
Yes, yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And how do your family and friends feel about your behavior?
Interviewee:
Like I said, I don't let anybody in my house anymore except my best friend.
My brother lives halfway across the country and he can't afford to fly and that was the best way to visit, so I haven't seen him.
Family don't come in.
I have casual friends at church, and I would be seeing them if not for the pandemic.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm 
Interviewee:
Not just going to my classes at church, but we did a lot of social justice, social action projects, and I like doing that and working with immigrant families, and all of that stuff.
Interviewer:
And have you ever had conflicts with people close to you or landlords about your behavior?
Interviewee:
No, because I've owned this house for about 19 years, I think.
It's my house and it's inside, mostly.
I am getting embarrassed about my front yard, but it's not to a point that a neighbor would complain.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Interviewee:
Yes, that's why I finally decided that I needed to assign one of my three bedrooms to be the place that I would put things I'm considering getting rid of.
That room is now completely filled.
I can't even walk in the room anymore.
There's clothes on a single bed, there are countless books, probably several hundred books in that room alone.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm 
Interviewee:
There's a large closet that's filled with clothes and the bottom is filled with shoes.
I've given up on that room and I live in all the other rooms of the house.
I'm sitting in my...
Every room in the house except my bedroom and bathrooms have stacks of paper, even the living room.
I'm on a three cushion couch, and two of the cushions have papers on that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I look at my easy chair with ottoman.
The ottoman is covered in papers.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm
