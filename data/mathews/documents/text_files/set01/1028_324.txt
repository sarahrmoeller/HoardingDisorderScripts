Interviewer:
The next part of the interview will be a series of questions that I'll ask you just generally about hoarding, and its effect on your, and your feelings regarding it. The first thing that I'd like to discuss with you is to have you describe your problems with clutter and hoarding, and how long this has been going on.
Participant 28:
I think it's probably been going on always. I've always collected things, like for sentimental reasons, and I've always collected things because I just like how they look, and probably since I moved in to my own space that has more space, like early on I didn't. Growing up, I had my bedroom where I could collect things in, and then I had a small studio apartment that I shared with somebody that I was respectful of their space. But the bigger my space got, now I have a house and a garage, and I've lived here for 33 years, so in the last 33 years, with the more space, it's fully gotten to be more noticeable, this issue.
I feel I always had this tendency, but now that I live here, and my husband does not have an issue with it, so I often wonder if I had married somebody who was very meticulous and is a minimalist, whether the marriage would have lasted, you know? Or whether I would've modified and just got used to a different way, but boy, that would've been tough.
Interviewer:
Yeah. That's a lot to think about and consider.
Participant 28:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How severe would you say that this behavior is now?
Participant 28:
How severe?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 28:
That seems like a very unscientific question, but that's okay, because, you know, what I compare myself to, which helps me rationalize and feel okay about myself, is those programs that either used to be on TV called Hoarders. Did you ever watch that series?
Interviewer:
I have seen it, yes.
Participant 28:
Yeah, so I watched that for a period of time. I used to record it and watch them, and it definitely reassured me that I am okay, so how serious it is based on having seen it is how bad it can be. That's a true judgment. I mean, it can be really bad, I feel, for those people. But I also have some friends who are minimalists, and then I have friends who are regular folk in this spectrum, so compared to most of the people I know, it's medium severe. But compared to the people I've seen on TV and have heard of who are mentally ill, I think, I am somewhere medium. You know, like low-medium.
Interviewer:
Do you mind describing your area right now, the space that you live in?
Participant 28:
Where I'm sitting or generally all the different areas?
Interviewer:
Go ahead and do a brief overview of all of the areas if you feel comfortable.
