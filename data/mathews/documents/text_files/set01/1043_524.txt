Participant 043:
We don't usually focus that much specifically on the OCD type stuff now but my doctors told me that since ...
I've been diagnosed with a brainstem tumor and since that time he told me that there might be some correlation between brainstem tumors and OCD.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 043:
It seemed like at first after my surgery, it was better for a bit.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Okay.
Why do you feel that your behavior is a problem?
Participant 043:
Because it's embarrassing and it also can be hazardous.
Actually, last October, before I started with the organizer, the ambulance had to come give me ... I had pneumonia and the first responders I guess told the people who ...
I'm in a senior housing complex.
The first responders told the two staff people who were there when they came that my place was a safety hazard.
I ended up moving to a larger unit with another room and stuff and it's not as bad anymore.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
I can imagine that was a difficult situation.
How do your family and friends feel about your behavior?
Participant 043:
I don't really have any family anymore.
Friends, I had one friend who basically was ...
She knew that it was a problem and she didn't understand it so she basically ...
She'd say, "I'm going to call this organization to come help you" or something.
Interviewer:
Okay.
You mentioned that when the ambulance came, they kind of expressed this sort of how your space was maybe considered hazardous and it was maybe difficult to get around.
Have you ever had conflicts with anybody close to you like your friends or people who may run the senior complex?
Participant 043:
Not really but my dad when he was alive had ... I had a condo that I owned and lived in.
He ended up paying for me to get my kitchen remodeled.
At that time, I had gotten things cleaned up.
Then he was disappointed when he heard that things were getting messy again.
It was a case where my brother was a responder to my Lifeline and he had come up and when the ambulance came, they had told him that it was a safety hazard.
Apparently, he had told it to my dad.
Interviewer:
He was maybe a little bit disappointed with you.
Was he worried when they told him that the space may be a hazard?
Participant 043:
I think he was more disappointed.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I know you mentioned that you're living in a senior complex and that now you're in a bigger unit so you have an extra bedroom so there's a little bit more space but do you live alone?
Can you describe what this space is like?
