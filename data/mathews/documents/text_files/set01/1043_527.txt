Participant 043:
Then also I do see the dog that I gave to her and then a picture pretty much every day. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Would you say that these items that are related to your mother and father are what make you feel at home?
Participant 043:
Yeah. I think so. 
Interviewer:
What would you like your home to look like?
Participant 043:
I used to watch the show about tiny houses. I used to think that that would be so nice and that basically it would be like I could start over again. I know that wouldn't happen but I would just like to have it so that pretty much stuff is clear and away in cabinets and whatever and that I wouldn't have to be embarrassed if people come.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Wanting just an open clear space where everything has a place, everything is organized?
Participant 043:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Participant 043:
I also have a lot of stuff that's out because when I'm working on a project ... There's 175 residents where I live and I'm making cloth face masks for everyone. 
Interviewer:
Oh, wow. That's amazing.
Participant 043:
I have all the stuff out so that my sewing machine is on the tray table and I've got fabric everywhere.
Interviewer:
That's really amazing that you're doing that. When you think about your possessions, how do you define whether or not something is valuable?
Participant 043:
I'm not really sure. It's like sometimes I will decide, okay, I can get rid of this. I used to do woodworking. I'm not in a position where I can do any kind of saw or anything but yet it was so hard to get rid of the saws and stuff like that, even though I knew I'd never use them again. I would put them in a box and then I would tell my organizer that she had to take it that day for fear that I would take it out of there.
Interviewer:
Right. Well, do you think that those saws were considered valuable to you?
Participant 043:
I don't know about valuable. It's just that maybe I was thinking that I was going to one day return to be able to do that stuff. I don't know.
Interviewer:
Yeah, because they were tied to something that you really enjoyed?
Participant 043:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Interviewer:
When you're thinking about your possessions, do you base their value off of monetary, off of them being a family-related object? When you see your possessions and you decide mentally, "Okay, this is valuable to me" how do you go through that process?
Participant 043:
It's more emotionally related. I don't think I have anything that's really valuable as far as money-wise. A lot of the stuff it's stuff that can't be replaced like pictures and stuff that I have. You wouldn't be able to go buy.
Interviewer:
Right. Things that have an emotional and important connection to you, those would be valuable?
