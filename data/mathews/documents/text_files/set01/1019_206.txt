Interviewer:
How about with papers and files?
Participant 019:
Papers and files are in two locations, I have one, two, three, four, I have six file drawers.
Going through my daughter's room, we have a five-drawer cabinet which my wife cleaned out and disposed of all the old papers and got the file cabinet out.
So that was a good project, again, you can tell that she is ...
Interviewer:
Pushing you to ...
Participant 019:
She is pushing me and making my life better.
Honestly, there's another feeling like, while my wife is still here and we're still healthy, we need to use this time to make our lives better and happier.
Interviewer:
So you see the process of going through your stuff as an activity that you can do with and for your wife to improve your lives together as you age.
Participant 019:
Right.
Interviewer:
That's wonderful.
I love it, the organization as a loving activity is really nice.
Participant 019:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Because I know it makes her happy, it makes me happy and then her too.
Interviewer:
When you think about the things that you save, which do you think are the most important or valuable for you?
Which things would you have the hardest time giving up?
Participant 019:
I would say the projects that are currently active, which are things like my painting around the house, the gardening tools, the maintenance of the grounds, like my tractor and my lawn mower and the tools I use for dirt moving, wheelbarrow, things like that.
Interviewer:
So most important possessions you have are the ones that you use the most.
Participant 019:
Yes.
Interviewer:
So would it be fair to say that when you think about all the things you save, the thing that makes them valuable is that they are useful, they are useful and used by you?
Participant 019:
Yes.
Interviewer:
So when you're going through the process of organizing or trying to, for example, you can think about the garage, when you were going through the garage, how did you make decisions about what was trash and needed to be thrown away and what needed to continue to be saved?
What was that process like for you?
Participant 019:
Obviously, if it had aged into un-usability, meaning rusting or hardening of paint or things like that, that was an easy hit.
Going through it also thinking that probably that I'll never ...
That project is beyond me now, is another factor in deciding how to do things.
One of the important elements for me is to somehow try to regroup the scattered-ness of the elements that I have.
In other words, I don't think we've talked too much about the fact that I tend to use something and just drop it.
That's a very important element of my character.
Once I've solved the problem, I don't clean up after myself.
I think that probably should go back in some list.
