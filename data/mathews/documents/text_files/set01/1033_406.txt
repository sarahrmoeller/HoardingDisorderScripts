Interviewee33:
Yeah, well, for a while it did because we couldn't drop stuff off at the donation centers.
I was sort of keeping stuff that I felt might have a use for donation centers, but then we did that whole yard sale thing.
After we did the yard sale, the donation centers were open at that point, so we just deposited everything that we thought might be of value, and we threw everything else away.
The donation centers were still restricted in what they were accepting.
For instance, they did not accept furniture, or else we would have given them that futon.
I guess the one thing COVID changed was since there were restrictions, we started realizing we just had to throw things away because there was no way people were going to casually pick something up anymore.
Everything would have to be able to be sanitized or cleaned in some way before anyone would accept it.
When you realize that, then you're more likely to throw something away I guess.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
People are not...
Are at least more cautious about taking things from other people.
Interviewee33:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer:
Have you had any more time for organizing?
It sounds like you're still fairly busy.
Interviewee33:
No, we're as busy as ever.
In fact, I somewhat jealously see everyone online talking about all the spare time and what are they going to do with it.
I'm like, "Boy, I could fill your spare time with half a dozen things."
Decluttering is only one of them.
Interviewer:
Right, but it could be one of them.
Okay.
Looking at its impacts just generally again, has COVID-19 had any impact on your overall physical health?
Interviewee33:
No, not.
Interviewer:
What about any impacts on your overall mental health or wellbeing?
Interviewee33:
Not mine personally.
I mean it increases worry for my parents and of course, as I said, my dad got very anxious about it.
I had to sort of mediate his anxiety as well, but I feel like, personally, I'm not excessively worried about it.
It's something that just I feel like has to run its course.
I mean we do what we can.
I think that it's really important to socially distance as much as possible and wear your mask.
I'm really fortunate that I work in an environment where I have my own office.
I can sort of shut myself off from most people a lot of the time.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Interviewee33:
But I don't see a point in getting really worked up about COVID.
Interviewer:
Have you found that there's any coping techniques that are helpful or no?
Interviewee33:
No. Nothing recently.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Just making sure I have everything.
Just in general...
It's okay if you don't have an answer for this or anything, but where do you generally seek comfort from?
From others, possessions, something different.
