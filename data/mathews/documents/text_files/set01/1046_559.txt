Participant 46:
Right, family objects. Very expensive items like jewelry. Family objects, and the more pretty things. When I say more pretty things, so if I have 25 vases, and 22 of them are the standard florist vases, but one of them is a Baccarat crystal, I want to keep the Baccarat crystal. But I can-
Interviewer:
Would you get rid of the other vases? 
Participant 46:
Well, and that's what I'm trying to do now. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 46:
I'm looking at them, and that's my probably right now, is I can only tackle one item. I try to do one item a day. I try. It doesn't always work. And my last thing, my worst hoarding object is paper. 
Interviewer:
What kind of paper? 
Participant 46:
Newspaper, personal notes, like you told me to make this list, right? 
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 46:
So now I'm going to keep this list for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks. I dated it, already have it here. I want to look at it. I will keep paper. I have paper in my house, I found a note that was 34 years old. By the way, I found canned crab that was 44 years old, they used to date them, from Walgreens. A note. So it wasn't busted or anything, and I opened it. I said, "Oh, you're not going to eat this." But I opened it just to see what a 44-year-old can of crab looked like. But I'm a great paper saver. Even though there's computers, I have to save a lot of paper, and even my taxes. I've got 50 years of taxes. What am I going to do? I have to figure, nobody's going to care what happened in 1970.
Interviewer:
So all of these papers, why do you consider them valuable? 
Participant 46:
Because I haven't read them. There might be something important that I need to know. Oh, that may be another reason. I was not educated properly and people used to make fun of me, so I self-educated. And so now I spend all my time reading everything, in case I miss something that might be useful to me, and I do throw it away once I've gathered the information. However, I do have over a thousand cookbooks so, and I just love cookbooks. They're like reading material for me. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So if you lost any of these papers and you hadn't had a chance to read them, because it sounds like once you have consolidated the information, that is when you decide to throw it away, would that be correct? 
Participant 46:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So if you-
Participant 46:
But if I read an article that I think I need, I keep it. So you could imagine.
