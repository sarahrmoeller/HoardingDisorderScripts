My first question is going to be, can you please describe your hoarding and how long it's been going on?
Participant 45:
Okay, you have my age there. I'm 73. I would say my hoarding started probably in my 30s or 40s, the really bad hoarding. I didn't have many things growing up really. So there wasn't much hoarding but then as you accumulate in life as you get older. Also, my personal circumstances I think started causing a tendency toward hoarding and I'm just trying to think like, '85, let me just thinking, Yeah, that's about right. Late 30s to early 40s is when it really started being bad, a problem.
