Interviewer:
Has it ever impacted friendships or romantic relationships?
Participant 035:
I haven't had a romantic relationship in so long.
Interviewer:
This all happened after that?
Participant 035:
Yeah.
That doesn't really apply.
It affects friendships in that, I'm not comfortable inviting people to come to the house.
I'm missing out on that.
Interviewer:
Has it ever impacted your work?
Participant 035:
Yeah.
When I couldn't find things.
Yes, it did.
Interviewer:
Have you ever tried to get help with this behavior?
Either from somebody to help you organize, or going to see a counselor or a psychologist about it?
Participant 035:
No. I saw a psychologist, gosh, in, let's see, it was in the late '90s, saw a psychologist, and everything seemed to be related back to the depression.
I felt like I had, and depression's, that's my family illness.
I can look at it from the both maternal and fraternal sides of the family, going back to my grandparents.
Of course, I felt like I have worked through all of the growing up things, and resentment and anger, and I'm at peace with a lot of that.
I'm going, let's think about this as a chemical imbalance, and find the magic pill that will help me manage it.
I've been on different antidepressants for years now.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like any of that has been helpful for you?
Participant 035:
At least once a year, I'll go, I don't think any of this is doing any good, and I will do a period of abstinence from it, to see, does it get worse, or what.
Yes, it does seem to get worse, that I would, not only would I still be sitting still, but I'd be crying a lot.
It's never gotten to ...
I've never made a suicide gesture.
I would have periods of time where I thought about it, and that's why I started on meds, but anyway.
I thought, yep, it's kind of like, I needed to quit taking it to see what would life be like without it, and to see is it helping at all.
Anyway.
It hasn't cured my cluttering thing, my need to put myself about ...
You keep your house so messy, that's why you can't have friends over.
It's your own fault, this is controllable.
Interviewer:
Yeah, it sounds like-
Participant 035:
It keeps my emotions more on an even keel.
Interviewer:
It sounds like you saw help for the problems with depression, you feel like you've worked out a lot of the issues you needed to work out, but there's also a biochemical component.
While that's helped by antidepressants, it's not solved by antidepressants, and it doesn't seem to be solving at all the cluttering aspect.
That sounds like-
Participant 035:
No. Interviewer:
Again, I'm just saying this back to you to check in with you, so feel free to contradict me if you feel like this is incorrect-
Participant 035:
No, you've got it.
