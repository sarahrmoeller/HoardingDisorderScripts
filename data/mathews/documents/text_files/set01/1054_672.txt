Participant:
But I have a price tag on things too. The most I ever spent for a piece was like thirty dollars, but a lot of my stuff is five, ten, you know, because I’m very particular. So, now that now, and uh, there’s another thing I just started and [laughing] well, I have my cups and saucers, the regular size. Then, I have what they call “demies,” which is the small one. Well, I’ve seen something new I kinda like where it comes with a saucer, you know the saucer for your, your cup, but it’s a plate too! There’s a little place on it where the cup fits. And, so now, I’ve been on a hunt, like, to find more of those kinds of pieces.
Interviewer (35:38): Okay, so, we can see you kind of go through stages of like what you like to collect?
Participant:
Right, right. Exactly, yeah. 
Interviewer (35:46): Okay. So, now it's, you know, the cups in the saucers with the plates. Do you remember, in particular, something from your past that you really like to collect, other than the purses and the wallets?
Participant:
Um, let me see… I’ve never been a show freak. When I was married to my first husband for twenty-five years, only had two pairs of shoes to my name.
Interviewer (36:15): Right.
Participant:
And the shoes were not something. Um, let me see… I would, I’d I have to go back to wallets, you know, because I like them. If I can find something real nice and not pay a lot of money for it, that's like a price to me.
Interviewer (36:30): Right. Yeah, I understand. So, you know with, um, with your ex-husband that you mentioned, did he have a lot of stuff, or was he very minimal in terms of the stuff he had?
Participant:
I think he was pretty minimal, you know. He had a desk in one room, and then he had his article of clothes in another room. So, he was pretty, you know he's very organized, yep.
Interviewer (36:58): Okay. And, so, his organization and you know, your tendency to collect things, that kind of, you know, definitely caused some issues between you?
Participant:
No, no. Because I couldn’t bring anything in the house.
Interviewer (37:10): Right. Okay, so, in what way did he prevent you from bringing things into the house?
Participant:
Well, when I first, you know, we got married and everything, and I, you know, I want to bring in some of my things, you know, because I had these beautiful wooden bookcases with glass doors on them. 
Interviewer (37:27): Mhmm.
Participant:
Uh, he didn't want them. He didn’t want those in. I couldn’t even bring in pictures of my family or grandchildren.
Interviewer (37:35): Wow.
Participant:
Because it just didn't feel like it was my space to do anything with.
Interviewer (37:40): Alright, and because of that, where did you end up keeping this stuff?
