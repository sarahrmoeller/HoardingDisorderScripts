Interviewer:
Okay. And so your children, I know we've briefly talked about this before, but you said that they don't really get upset about it at all, right?
Interviewee:
Not really.
They'll say something like, "Man, you've had that forever."
Or something like that, "Why don't you get rid of that?" But I wouldn't say that they get upset or anything.
Interviewer:
Okay.
They've never tried to be like, "I'm going to like help you clean this out."
Or anything like that.
They just say, "Oh, you've had it a long time."
And then move on.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Only if I say something to them like, "I need to get rid of some of this stuff."
And then they'll say, "Well, let me help you."
They're very supportive, but I would say they're not critical of me they're just-

Interviewee:
Yeah.
Exactly.
Interviewer:

Interviewee:
I would say I would just so things are neater.
And so I can find things easier.
If I put stuff in the right place the first time, instead of placing it down then I would know exactly where to find it.
And I probably should just let go of some things.
For instance, jewelry, I've got some that's extremely old and I really never wear.
Well, why don't I just say, "Okay, I'm going to limit myself to 10 pairs of earrings and that's it."
But instead I have plenty more that I don't really wear.
So I would like to change just to ease up and make life simpler.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That makes sense.
Okay.
That kind of concludes our-
