Interviewee:
I have no problem getting rid of furniture that I don't use.
Another thing I can say, going back to the question what do I collect or hoard, artwork would definitely be up there.
Interviewer:
Artwork.
And is this ...
Interviewee:
Other people's.
Interviewer:
Like friends' artwork, or ...
Interviewee:
Friends, either.
Yeah.
I don't think I have anything from people I don't know.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I don't have any Van Gogh prints ...
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
... Or anything like that.
It's all work people that I know.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I thought about that as something I hoard or collect.
I'm looking at the walls.
Got a lot of artwork on the walls.
Interviewer:
Got a lot of art work.
Do you think that's the most precious stuff is the artwork?
Or what do you think is the most valuable thing, like, if you were to lose it would be absolutely devastating?
Interviewee:
The most valuable ...
From time to time, I've done creative writing.
So, I would say any of that stuff would be the most valuable.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
What would it be like if you lost it?
Interviewee:
It would be like losing a part of myself.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And do you think you have too much stuff, or do you think it's pretty normal?
Interviewee:
Every time I move I think I have too much stuff.
I have quite a bit more than my wife.
And it's irrelevant to the survey here, but my mom and her side of the family are sort of the opposite.
They're complete declutter immaculate houses.
Interviewer:
What's that like, seeing that?
Does that inspire you to clean your stuff more?
Interviewee:
It does, absolutely.
It's kind of intimidating sometimes, but it's definitely inspiration and sort of envy sometimes.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Interviewee:
It's just so easy for them to get rid of stuff, or declutter, or oh, I don't use this anymore.
I got rid of it.
Interviewer:
Would you say that envy, does that come up when you see, when you go over to friends' houses and see that their house is clean and stuff, and you wish it could be that easy for you?
Interviewee:
To be honest, I don't really ...
Most of my friends, and even in school, there's nothing ...
Even my house, outside of that room right now, it's no worse than anybody else that I know.
But as far as ...
It's certainly whenever, and I have moved a lot, unfortunately, is when I really notice it.
Even with my wife, she has quite a bit less stuff than I do.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
And you live with your wife?
Interviewee:
It's just a lot to manage.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
