Participant 32:
It's because I think of the lack of socializing that I can do now, some of these objects just feel more like familiar old friends and so they are there instead of... I mean they kind of replace the socializing in a sense. 
Interviewer:
Definitely, mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 32:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
And has the pandemic affected your attempts to declutter? Have you been spending more time trying to get organized? 
Participant 32:
Hmm, I think I've had more time to get organized. Not saying that I've spent a whole lot more time. But yes, I've spent some more time organizing, yes. 
Interviewer:
And these are more about your general functioning but has the pandemic impacted your overall physical health? 
Participant 32:
No. 
Interviewer:
Has it affected your overall mental health or wellbeing? Like has the lack of socialization taken a toll mentally or anything? 
Participant 32:
Yeah, I think a little bit it's taken a mental toll, the lack of social times, yes. 
Interviewer:
And has the pandemic affected you or your family financially? 
Participant 32:
Hmm... Not me so much and I don't really know about my family. Hmm, I think the answer's no. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And how have you been coping with this pandemic? Have you had any specific techniques or things that you do to help you find comfort or ease? 
Participant 32:
Hmm. Well yes, I talk to friends and family and so having conversations about it is somewhat soothing although it depends on who I talk to because a couple of my three sisters I disagree with very, very much about their beliefs about this COVID thing and so... Now I forget what the question was. 
Interviewer:
How have you been coping or what specific techniques? 
Participant 32:
Oh, copying yeah. Yeah, so conversations with... Yeah, with my friends primarily. 
Interviewer:
And if you were to pick, would you say that you find more comfort in your objects or your conversations with your friends? 
Participant 32:
Conversations with friends. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Have you sought any treatment, resources, or some other kind of professional support during COVID-19? 
Participant 32:
Hmm, I'm trying to remember. I've gone... I know I've gone to counselors and a couple of body work type of people, physical therapists, and acupuncturists and that kind of thing for some things. But I'm trying to remember though before... I think it was before COVID. No, I've gone to see a physical therapist. This was a thing that... Whatever, just from my moving and all that, I sprained my back and so I needed some help with that. But as far as psychological sort of counseling or whatever, no, I haven't done that since COVID started. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And has COVID affected your motivation to seek help for your hoarding behavior specifically?
