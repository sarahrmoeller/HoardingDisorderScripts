Interviewee:
Okay. All right.
Do you think you have too much stuff at the moment?
How do you know when you have too much?
Interviewee:
No more room.
Stuff put away in boxes that you never even look at because there's so much stuff.
Why have it if you don't have it out and enjoying it?
You get to that point and there's just plain no more place to put stuff.
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Okay.
You're kind of limited by your physical dimensions of your house?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
If you moved into a bigger house, you would just ...
Interviewee:
Oh, man.
Means more stuff.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Actually we're at the point now where we're going to decrease in size and I have to face the reality of what do I do?
What do I get rid of?
What do I keep?
That's going to be a big challenge in the next year or so?
Interviewee:
Okay.
Kind of going off of that, if you have to choose between items, how do you choose?
How are you going to make that decision?
Interviewee:
I don't know yet.
That's what I'm trying to figure out.
I'm trying to go through.
I don't know.
We just went through it with my mom and it was so hard for us even to handle getting rid of her stuff and my father's stuff.
Now that's all added in here.
Yeah.
I have no idea how I'm going to do it.
I really don't.
Interviewee:
Were you able to get rid of anything when you were going through their items?
Interviewee:
The things that just were falling apart and stuff.
Yeah.
There were things that nobody wanted of my parents.
Those we did get rid of.
The things that were sentimental to us all, those we all kept.
Even if they were in bad condition.
I'm talking about my siblings.
We just added it to our piles.
I have my piles.
They have theirs.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Do your siblings collect as much as you do?
Interviewee:
No. One of them does.
The rest don't.
No. My baby sister and I both have issues with it.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Did your parents collect a lot also?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Yeah.
So did our grandparents.
It's genetic.
Interviewee:
Okay.
You'd say a lot of your family members then [CROSSTALK].
Interviewee:
Well, I mean, not of my siblings but, yes, generational.
Yes.
