Interviewee:
I keep my keys and my pocketbook in a specific place. If I put it somewhere else ... I'll give you an example of a couple of weeks ago. I had my keys in my hand and I came in from doing roofing work on the apartment building that I live in. I came in a different entrance and I had a piece of paper in my hand and my car keys. Of course, I had to go to the bathroom right away. So, I put those down and then I couldn't find my car keys.
Fortunately, I have another key that I could use and lo and behold, I had put the keys and then put the piece of paper on top of the keys. So, I didn't see the keys when I was looking for them and it was sheer good luck that I found them. I would say that I'm early 99% of the time and rarely late because that's how I grew up. You get there early. At least, 10 minutes early or, else, you're not on time. So, that is not me at all, but if I don't put something in exactly the same place, then I lose track of it easily.
Interviewer:
Okay, and do you think that his behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
See, I never considered this ... I never heard that a psychiatrist would treat that. If there's treatment available, then yeah, that'd be super.
Interviewer:
Okay, yeah. There are treatment options available if you see a psychiatrist. Okay, so you would say that one does?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. Oh, excuse me. Okay. So, this next one, John Doe has books that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. Books occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove ... Oh, my god, excuse me. Okay. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of the items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallets, so he'll spend 10, 20 minutes looking for them, until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.
Interviewee:
My opinion, yeah, I would say ... I'm grateful to say I don't have to move anything out of the tub or move anything out of the [CROSSTALK] door. I'm feeling a little bit better about myself. [CROSSTALK] Not that I would take pictures of my place and send them to you, but I, at least, can get from point A to point B, and take a shower, and walk indoors, and wash my dishes and use my stove.
