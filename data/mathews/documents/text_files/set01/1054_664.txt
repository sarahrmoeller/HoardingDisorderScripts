Interviewer: Right.
So, what does your hoarding look like?
So, in your space in your, you know, bedrooms in your house or—
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer: What does that look like?
Participant:
Well, um, uh, I don’t remember too good right now.
Um, let me see… oh gosh… okay, let me—
Interviewer: No worries.
Participant:
Yeah, um, I’m talking to somebody [inaudible; ].
Okay, alright.
Can you give that question again?
Interviewer: Right.
So, you were talking earlier about how, you know, you couldn't really bring stuff into the house with your second husband.
But now that you can, what does your space look like?
Participant:
Um, my bedroom’s a wreck.
Interviewer: Okay, so, what do you mean by wreck?
Participant:
Well, I’ve got, um, I’ve got stuff everywhere.
I have wrapped up my, my um, my bed has not been cleared.
I sleep on one side.
Interviewer: Okay.
Participant:
And, uh, yeah, I would like to have a bed.
Interviewer: So, what are you keeping on your bed that's preventing you from sleeping on the other side?
Participant:
Oh my god.
Uh, [inaudible; ].
Sometimes I put things, you know, to put them into a container, so I can find somewhere to put that.
Um, it’s, it's just all kinds of different things.
What mainly stays on my bed is, um, I always have my Bible with me.
Interviewer: Okay.
Participant:
It’s always on my bed.
That’s, that’s my supportive thing.
Interviewer: Right.
So, the other things are just kind of, you know, uh, random things that need to be sorted?
Participant:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: Okay, so, there's no particular thing that you tend to hoard more than others, like papers or anything like that?
Participant:
Umm… um, I have a huge, uh, selection of cups and saucers.
Interviewer: Of what was that?
Participant:
Cups and saucers.
Interviewer: Cups and saucers, gotcha.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
And right now, I have so many that I have to, uh, put them in the uh, um, the storage room, right?
In my laundry room I have a big place of bins around.
Interviewer: Gotcha.
Participant:
So, that I have managed to control.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, other than your bedroom, do you hoard in any other parts of the house?
Participant:
Oh, uh, you see, I say in… probably the kitchen.
Interviewer: Okay.
And what does that look like?
Participant:
It’s uh, where I keep, well… Um, I have a lot of things in the pantry that are for putting things in the pantry.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, things like dishes or Tupperware, or things like that?
Participant:
Um, I have, um, wooden spoons.
Interviewer: Wooden spoons, gotcha.
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, when you go about collecting these things that end up, you know, um… that you end up hoarding, where do you get these things?
And why do you purchase them?
