Interviewer:
And when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?
Interviewee:
They bring memories.
Interviewer:
Okay, so that nostalgia?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Nostalgia, that's the word.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
Interviewee:
Well, pretty much if it has any use at all.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So just any utility for specific purpose?
Interviewee:
Yeah, yeah.
I don't like wasting things, so.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And how do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Interviewee:
When I can't think of any use for it.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And what do you consider trash?
Interviewee:
Something that has no function and no sentimental value.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So I know that you mentioned that your photographs are the most precious item in your house for you, but what would happen if you lost all of them?
Interviewee:
I would feel terrible.
That's all my memories.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
And do you personally think that you have too much stuff?
Interviewee:
That's a good question.
Probably to a certain extent.
And like I said, these boxes that we haven't gone through yet, I'm sure there's plenty we could get rid of still, but most of the stuff I think we should keep.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And how would you decide when you have too much?
Interviewee:
Mm, that's a good question.
I don't know.
I guess if it was interfering with the quality of life in the house, if we couldn't get around the stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So when it would start to interfere with your daily life?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Interviewee:
Back to the same old thing, if it had a sentimental value and if it had a use, I would want to keep it if it didn't-
Interviewer:
Would you prioritize one over the other though?
Would you prioritize your sentimentality over the utility?
Interviewee:
Probably.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behaviors, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Well, collections are organized for one thing and they usually have value.
I do have a stamp collection.
Interviewer:
Okay, so just-
Interviewee:
But most of it-
Interviewer:
Go ahead.
Interviewee:
And I have lots of video tapes that I've accumulated through the years and I know they're getting deteriorated.
So as soon as I retire eventually, I'm going to have to transfer them all to DVDs.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Okay.
So the difference would be the organization and the monetary value?
Interviewee:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Interviewee:
I guess, without going in?
If there's an odor coming from their home or if they can't leave, if friends and family are complaining, things like that.
