Interviewer:
And when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?
Participant 014:
They bring memories.
Interviewer:
Okay, so that nostalgia?
Participant 014:
Yeah. Nostalgia, that's the word.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
Participant 014:
Well, pretty much if it has any use at all.
Interviewer:
Okay. So just any utility for specific purpose?
Participant 014:
Yeah, yeah. I don't like wasting things, so.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And how do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Participant 014:
When I can't think of any use for it.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And what do you consider trash?
Participant 014:
Something that has no function and no sentimental value.
Interviewer:
Okay. So I know that you mentioned that your photographs are the most precious item in your house for you, but what would happen if you lost all of them?
Participant 014:
I would feel terrible. That's all my memories.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And do you personally think that you have too much stuff?
Participant 014:
That's a good question. Probably to a certain extent. And like I said, these boxes that we haven't gone through yet, I'm sure there's plenty we could get rid of still, but most of the stuff I think we should keep.
Interviewer:
Okay. And how would you decide when you have too much?
Participant 014:
Mm, that's a good question. I don't know. I guess if it was interfering with the quality of life in the house, if we couldn't get around the stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay. So when it would start to interfere with your daily life?
Participant 014:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay. And if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?
Participant 014:
Back to the same old thing, if it had a sentimental value and if it had a use, I would want to keep it if it didn't-
Interviewer:
Would you prioritize one over the other though? Would you prioritize your sentimentality over the utility?
Participant 014:
Probably.
Interviewer:
Okay. And what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behaviors, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Participant 014:
Well, collections are organized for one thing and they usually have value. I do have a stamp collection.
Interviewer:
Okay, so just-
Participant 014:
But most of it-
Interviewer:
Go ahead.
Participant 014:
And I have lots of video tapes that I've accumulated through the years and I know they're getting deteriorated. So as soon as I retire eventually, I'm going to have to transfer them all to DVDs.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. So the difference would be the organization and the monetary value?
Participant 014:
Right.
Interviewer:
Okay. And is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant 014:
I guess, without going in? If there's an odor coming from their home or if they can't leave, if friends and family are complaining, things like that.
