Interviewee:
Yeah I'm getting better as I get older, because I know none of it goes with us when we leave this world.
I'm learning to be content with less.
It's not about stuff.
It's really about what life is about for me.
It's not about stuff.
It's about people, about relationships and memories and experiences.
Interviewer:
Is this something, like a mentality that you've acquired you think with getting older, or has this especially happened over this period where you are unable to see as many people?
Interviewee:
No, no, no. This is something that comes with maturity, I believe.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
How are you doing since about mid March with your physical health?
Interviewee:
Well I put on a few extra pounds, but otherwise, a little depressed, if you want to know the real truth, a little bit depressed, because I'm a people person and I like social interaction, so it's difficult to be isolated.
Otherwise, I know it will all come to an end at some point, so we make the best of it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Has this time affected your family financially at all?
Has that been an extra stressor?
Interviewee:
Yeah, it has.
We had a business that my husband was doing, and it's only about four years old so it wasn't a really big, huge, thriving business, but nevertheless it was a business that he was diligently working to build.
It sort of has died.
I mean a little bit trickles in here and there, but that has died off, that source of income has died off.
It wasn't ever a big source of income but it was something, and it's all but gone now.
He's had to go take work outside the home, and then I have taken on a part time job.
Yeah we have kind of mode, since all this started, to get our debts paid off, and get situated with our finances.
Interviewer:
That's good to hear that you guys were able to find jobs during this period.
I know that can be rough.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like it was almost helpful, in a way, to have to find a job in order to interact with people?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I like it.
I don't know, he complains about it, but I think it's good for both of us, I do.
Actually I was sick during the month of July and this job that I have, it's real flexible so I can pick and choose when I want to work, so I wasn't able to work for about three weeks because I had allergy symptoms and I had to get tested for COVID and it was negative but that all took some time so I couldn't go back to work for like three weeks.
I've just started working back this week.
I've missed having that social interaction, getting out of the house and being around people.
