Interviewer:
When you talk about things that could be of value to you or your family, you mean they could be sentimentally of value, they could be important in the history of your family and in kind of the memories of your family, or they could be valuable in an objective sense because they're antiques?
Participant 018:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like right now you have too much stuff?
Participant 018:
Yes. I'm still working on going through it.
Interviewer:
How do you know that the stuff that you have now is too much?
Participant 018:
Well, the high cost of rent.
Interviewer:
If that wasn't an issue, if you had a bigger space where you could keep all of your stuff, would you keep it all, if the money wasn't an issue?
Participant 018:
Well, I would still try to keep things organized.
Interviewer:
So, if you didn't have to-
Participant 018:
If I were able to organize it, then... I mean, if it was totally organized and it looked like everything was in the proper place, then I wouldn't necessarily consider that a hoard or clutter.
Interviewer:
So, even if money wasn't an issue, you would be okay with the amount of stuff you had, as long as it was all organized. So, organization is really the key for you.
Participant 018:
Yeah. That's the main thing.
Interviewer:
So, if money wasn't an issue and you could get it all organized, you would keep everything, but in an organized way?
Participant 018:
Well, I still don't think I would want to keep everything because I would prefer to be able to hand off some things, as I found someone else who could use it.
Interviewer:
So, this goes back to something that we talked about before. When you think about your behavior, how do you distinguish between keeping things in a collection or just normally saving or preserving things, and something that's hoarding or something that's clutter? What makes a difference? Is it that organization?
Participant 018:
Well, yes, organization and livability. So, if things are all in the way and causing you anxiety in life, then it's hoarding or clutter.
Interviewer:
So, it's not about the amount of stuff. It's about how organized the stuff is and whether or not it's in the way?
Participant 018:
Well, it could also be the amount of things if later in life it's going to cause stress in order to deal with what to do with things.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So, even if it was perfectly organized, if it was going to cause you stress to deal with it in the future, it would still be too much?
Participant 018:
Yeah. Now, I have been in collector groups, like an antique collectors' group, and some of them have things very well organized.
