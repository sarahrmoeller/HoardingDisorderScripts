Interviewer:
And you said you have an apartment and you mentioned that you have maybe more in too big furniture than would fit in that apartment.
Are you able to use all of the rooms?
Are you able to go in and out of the spaces comfortably?
Interviewee50:
Not comfortably.
I have to be really careful or I could easily fall down because I'm skipping around things to get where I needed to go.
And I sleep in a small space on my bed like the people on the TV.
Interviewer:
But you're able to get onto your bed.
Are you able to use your kitchen, your bathroom?
Interviewee50:
Yeah, I can use it, but it's not pristine or anything like that.
So yes.
Interviewer:
So the space is still basically usable by you for the things that you need to do, but it sounds like it's difficult for you to navigate and not easy for you to kind of do the things that you might want to do, and you're worried about falling that sound, right?
Interviewee50:
Yeah.
Because there's boxes and there's just stuff because it's been my apartment for the longest time, because it's just been me.
It's been a drop and go situation where I don't, sometimes it gets too quiet.
I love movies, so I like to watch movies.
It's my way of escaping as opposed to somebody who might have a drink because drinking scares me because my mom was an alcoholic.
So can't use that to shake off the day because my job stresses me out because it's just, sometimes I feel like a whore because basically I'm doing it for the money, not for the joy, not for anything other than a paycheck.
Interviewee50:
And it makes me have to dumb down for eight hours a day.
So I don't like to sometimes stay here even though maybe I can watch a movie or something because it's just too quiet.
So that's part of the shopping thing is just to get out of the house-
Interviewer:
It's like your recreation.
Interviewee50:
And not to be here, not because it's dirty, but almost just not to be here because there's nobody there but me.
I really miss having a dog that helped a great deal.
Although I'm having the doctor stop it just got worse after I stopped having the dog.
Interviewer:
And you feel like having the dog was helpful because you had company and so you didn't shop as much?
Interviewee50:
I had to be home because you just got to walk the dog or I was going to have poop to clean up when I got home and stuff.
Interviewer:
It gave you a routine.
