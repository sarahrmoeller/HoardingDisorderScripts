Participant:
Um, my sister's bedroom pretty much is clutter-free.
Interviewer (24:47) Okay, and is that her doing?
Participant:
She’s OCD.
Interviewer (24:50): Right. Okay, so, how about the common areas? Are there any common areas that are clutter-free?
Participant:
Um, right now I’ve got some stuff in the dining room which I’ve gotta move.
Interviewer (25:00): Gotcha.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer (25:03): Okay, so, how about like bathrooms, or maybe like the living rooms?
Participant:
Um, I have a few things in the living room and the dining room.
Interviewer (25:14): Gotcha.
Participant:
You know, because I've been trying to go through things, you know? The only way I've found that I can actually do something when I, when I look at a room the way it is, I get extremely depressed.
Interviewer (25:28): Right.
Participant:
The way I had dealt with some of that is I would pick up an item, which is the only way you could do it, and say, “Where can I put this? Where is somewhere?” And that's how I have to do it because I cannot face the bedroom.
Interviewer (25:45): So, for you, it's better to look at things one at a time and kind of deal with them on a piece-by-piece basis.
Participant:
That’s the only way I could do it.
Interviewer (25:55): Right. So, in that case, you don't get overwhelmed like you said?
Participant:
Right, right, right.
Interviewer (26:01): Okay, so, um, in terms of, you know, the clutter in, in your house has it prevented you from maybe having people over, or maybe has it ever caused like, an issue with a landlord or someone visiting?
Participant:
Oh, well, actually, my oldest sister wanted to come to the house, and I told her she couldn't because it's such a mess.
Interviewer (26:19): Right.
Participant:
It was so bad, you know?
Interviewer (26:22): Mhmm.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer (26:24): So, when something like that happens, do you typically try and like, clean it up or did you just say, “No, I'm sorry,” or something like that? 
Participant:
Well, when I told her, I said, “Hun, it is such a mess for you to come in here.” And she said, “If I don’t come in now I’m not coming ever.” So, it's like her decision.
Interviewer (26:48): Right. Okay, so, but nothing like a conflict with like, a landlord or like, a property owner, or anything like that?
Participant:
No, no. Um, I own my own condo. I do that, and um, no, no. I won't even let the pest control guy come in.
Interviewer (27:06): Okay, so is that because maybe you're a bit embarrassed about the clutter or, you—?
