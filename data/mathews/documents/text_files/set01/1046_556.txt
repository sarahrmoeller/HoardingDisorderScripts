Participant 46:
I feel like I lost something, but I also have to talk myself into, "If I really want another one, I can get it."
But I'm not understanding the loss of that spice jar, or I'm not understanding why I feel so terrible throwing things away.
Now I do throw garbage away.
It's interesting, but I don't consider a spice jar garbage.
You can get them in the store a dime a dozen, every time you buy a spice, so there's one always available.
By the way, I have plenty of other spices, so I don't know the attachment to that thing.
I have no personal attachment, so I don't understand why I had to think about this the whole week, and it just drained me.
But I did get rid of it, but I'm still talking about it.
Now some days it's a little more clear, and I feel...
The good side is, maybe if you think of the tenths.
One tenth, two tenths, three tenths.
There is now a one-tenth thing going, "Hey, I don't feel bad.
I feel good I got rid of something, that's one less thing I have to worry about," but it's still nine tenths, "Why?
Why do I have to let stuff go?"
Interviewer:
I imagine that this must be very difficult and confusing for you.
Since you expressed a lot of distress around this situation, it sounds like you're very aware, and are working on improving some of the changes you'd like to see.
Have you ever sought professional help, or asked anyone else for help with your behavior?
Participant 46:
Yes, I did go to a psychologist for many years.
I even took medication, while being-
Interviewer:
When did you see the psychologist?
Participant 46:
Okay, so let's see now.
It's been about 10 years, and I went to him for about... I went to a psychologist, but before then I went to a, what is that called?
They're not psychologists, but they're family-
Interviewer:
Psychiatrists?
Participant 46:
No, no. They're-
Interviewer:
Family counselors?
Participant 46:
Yeah, family counselor.
Because I was having issues with my relationship, based on the hoarding.
Interviewer:
That was your ex that you mentioned earlier?
Participant 46:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Yes, okay.
Where did you-
Participant 46:
So I went to a family counselor to figure out why we keep breaking up and why...
And then later I had to go to a psychologist because they thought maybe medication will bring it down.
But it turns out I did need some vitamin D, so that's helping a little bit, I think, so-
Interviewer:
Did you...
It is?
Yeah, it probably would.
I also find it helpful.
I take a lot of vitamins, too.
I definitely feel better when I do that.
Do you remember what medication you took, and are you still on it?
