Interviewer:
Okay. So then my next question is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items? There's no way around it, you're going to have to get rid of some of this stuff, would that really upset you?
Participant 45:
I would need a lot of time to prepare myself and get in the right mental state. Every once in a while I will throw something away and it will feel good but a lot of times it's just agonizing to throw something into the garbage. Could I do it if I absolutely had to? For most things, yes, but I would need a lot of time to get prepared and be able to do it. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 45:
To work through all the emotions, get myself prepared. 
Interviewer:
So when you say that you experience this distress when you throw something away, is it this sadness or you feel that you didn't, I guess, respect the item enough or you didn't get full use out of it? What kind of emotions are you, I guess exactly experiencing when you throw something away?
Participant 45:
Yeah, all of the above. A huge matrix of emotions to the point where you just sort of ... your brain almost fogs over. At the time you really have to take a lot of deep breaths and really ... and that's one of the things I do. If I really had to throw something away I didn't want to I'd have to go out and do some physical exercise and then get my deep breathing and my mind in place and then I would have to go through a huge amount to get prepared. 
Interviewer:
Okay. And so earlier you mentioned you don't have the best relationship necessarily with your sister but you mentioned that you have a book club, how did they feel about your hoarding problem?
Participant 45:
I don't think they were terribly aware of it because I had things in reasonable shape in the only two rooms they saw. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So they didn't have access to the rest of the house at all?
Participant 45:
Not at all. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 45:
In fact, fortunately somebody had a toddler so I was able to put a blockade across the other part of the house so that the toddler didn't go down there and then so it was clearly off limits to go there. And people don't just charge into the rest of your house in the book club. They just come and sit in the living room where the chairs are set up.
Interviewer:
Okay. Okay. 
Participant 45:
And then we have something to eat so I needed to have ... it was good to have the dining room table so the food and stuff could go there. 
Interviewer:
All right. So then you've never really had any other arguments about this besides with your sister?
