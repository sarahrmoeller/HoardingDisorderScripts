Interviewer:
So, they can be a little long but if you need me to repeat it just let me know and I can start okay.
Interviewee:
Sounds good.
Okay.
Interviewer:
So, this is the first one.
John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.
He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms.
His house is not always organized, but is usually not cluttered.
Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.
Interviewee:
What was that last sentence?
He barely what?
Interviewer:
Oh, I said he sometimes has difficulties finding his keys and wallet so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them, but when this happens he's rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.
Interviewee:
Thank you.
Interviewer:
So, does the person depicted in this scenario, do you think they have hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Well, they might have a mild case.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Oh, so I didn't really that fully, it's either do they have hoarding disorder or do you think their behavior is more like clutter problems?
Interviewee:
Oh, I would say it's more like a clutter problem.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, do you think this person should try and change their behavior?
Interviewee:
Yes, if it's a problem for them.
If he stresses about finding his keys and wallet.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?
Interviewee:
Probably not.
Interviewer:
Why would you say not?
Interviewee:
It doesn't sound severe enough that he would...
There might be other options like a group or some sort of support group or something like that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
Other than a psychiatrist.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And then, last question is is this behavior similar or different from your own?
Interviewee:
It is similar in that I do save boxes myself.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Is that the only way that you think it's similar?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
In-
Interviewee:
Because I rarely, I mean, my keys and my wallet and things like that I pretty much know where they are.
I put them in the same place every time, so.
