Interviewer 0:06- Ok, so to start off as you know this study is investigating individual’s attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. So the first question I’d like to ask you is what term would you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding? Are you ok with hoarding disorder or would you prefer another term?
Participant:
No hoarding disorder is fine. 
Interviewer 0:36- Ok great
Participant:
I mean I know why I [unclear] (0:39). But it is called hoarding; you can’t hide it. 
Interviewer 7:28- Ok. Thank you. So now we are going to be moving on to the next part of our interview which is just normal more conversational questions. So, could you please describe your hoarding disorder? How long has this been going on? 
Participant:
I want to say when I got into my teens because I [unclear](7:55) so I time everything around and then when I got married at a young age I didn’t have my stuff; I couldn’t get my stuff. There was even a time where I was actually without food, without that and I think that was when it really started.  Because if I don’t keep and I don’t have it and I see it, I want it. And let me tell you I don’t know if this is me talking to you right now in this conversation but if I go to the store, I will get things I don’t need, thinking I’m going to need them later. And I know that’s hoarding because when I bring it home, it sits. You know it just sits there. So, I just wanted; you know I started in my teens. I started to accumulate stuff and then I lost stuff. I was afraid. I was afraid that I would lose the chance to get stuff I wanted when I could see it. You would actually go nuts if you came over here right now. It’s not cluttered; it is cluttered but on my desk I don’t have a desk. 
9:03 Interviewer:
Ok. 
Participant:
I have a chair in the living room with stuff around it. 
Interviewer 9:06- So you’d say that your hoarding is more because of you just want to make sure that you have everything and you don’t lose anything?
Participant:
Yes and I don’t lose it. You know I just want it near me. I want to be able to [unclear] for it. 
Interviewer 9:20- And you said that this started maybe when you were in your teens?
Participant:
Yeah. 
Interviewer 9:25- Ok. 
Participant:
I had everything then I lost it.
Interviewer 9:30- How severe would you say that this behavior is now?
Participant:
Well for me, I mean, it’s actually if I had to do a one to ten I would say maybe a seven and a half. 
Interviewer 9:44- Ok.
