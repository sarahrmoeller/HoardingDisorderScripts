Interviewer:
Right so you would say that would attach feelings to inanimate objects to justify her saving or collecting tendencies.. And then that got caught on to you.
Interviewee:
Yes, yeah. My grandma getting through that she just kept everything my grandma was like the fire hazard keeping all the magazines type of a person, but not because she felt sorry for him because he felt that she would need them. My mom wasn't a fire hazard person, but she had, you know. She had the little trail through that house, but, um, but all of those things had personality, everything had a personality. We've been growing out of clothes and it didn't want the clothes. It was, you know, “oh no [UNCLEAR] they’ll miss you.”  So, there wasn't a flow of items. It was like a backlog of items.
Interviewer  I see. Okay, so maybe potentially poverty could also be a cause of hoarding disorder.
Interviewee059
Oh, yes. I suppose so yes.
Interviewer:
Okay. And how long has your hoarding disorder been going on for?
Interviewee:
Well, I’m 67 so I’d probably say maybe 50 years.
Interviewer  -Okay. And I know that you've mentioned that your behavior isn't as severe. But do you believe that your behavior is a problem?
Interviewee:
Um, I think that it is a problem. Yes my behavior is a problem because I've had to move several times and it's exhausting moving. And, especially common things that are easily replaceable and multiple things. So, it’s a problem, because; whereas if I had, If I had the correct number of things, all my things would fit in all the drawers that. But there are things on the counter that could be in the cupboard or in a drawer. But there are on the counter, because there isn't room in the drawer and that's not a problem. But I mean, it doesn't need to be considered a problem. It’s work for cleaning where as if it was empty it would be easier for cleaning so it just causes more work and more slowing down, and which is unnecessary. There are already five can openers.
Interviewer  Okay. Um, so you believe that your behavior is a problem because it creates unnecessary difficulties that that shouldn't be there.
Interviewee:
And extra work extra.
Interviewer:
Would you say that this behavior like you've gotten better through time, like your behavior, used to be more severe or…
Interviewee:
Yes, I guess my behavior would have been more severe because I was because I didn't have a partner who was who felt strongly about limits to items and adversity to shopping or stopping a car to look through a trash can.
Interviewer:
Okay. So, you would say that you would attribute the decreasing of the severity of your hoarding disordered due to your partner because he decreases you're collecting tendencies.
Interviewee:
Yes, yeah.
