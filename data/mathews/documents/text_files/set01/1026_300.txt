Interviewer:
Yeah, when you look at let's say, the folding table in your family room and you look at the papers that are on it and you pick one up, how would you know if it was something you needed to keep and save and go through or if it was something that you could just put straight in the trash?
Interviewee6:
All of it truthfully, can go in the trash, but I just feel this compulsion to read what's there, and I don't mean cover to cover just kind of scanning and seeing if I missed anything.
And it's a little bit irrational.
Interviewer:
So you recognize that you're not necessarily going to read every word but when you pick it up even though you know you don't need to save it, you like to just look through it and to make sure that there's not information there that you could use?
Interviewee6:
That's a big part of it, yeah.
But also I'm just curious, I love to read, I'm kind of a news junkie, so-
Interviewer:
So it's true curiosity, you're actually interested in whatever is on there?
Interviewee6:
Yeah it's a form of entertainment I would say.
Interviewer:
Definitely.
But then when the paper gets moldy or damaged in some way then you're totally fine with not even looking at it, just tossing it in the trash?
Interviewee6:
Exactly.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So, now I'm going to start to ask you some questions about hoarding disorder, which is not the behavior that you're describing.
Again part of this interview is to understand how people think about hoarding disorder.
So when you think about hoarding disorder, how would you distinguish somebody who has a problem with saving, like in hoarding disorder from somebody who has more normal saving behavior like maybe somebody who has a collection?
Interviewee6:
I would say the hoarding is more of an irrational thing.
That it's just a compulsion to save things, and my grandmother was that way, so I'm kind of familiar with it.
Interviewer:
So in hoarding disorder as opposed to collecting, there's not really that rational cognition behind it, it's all just a kind of impulse.
Interviewee6:
Right, and I think with collecting there's an element of pleasure there.
Interviewer:
So people who have hoarding disorder don't take pleasure in the same way as a collector in their items?
Interviewee6:
Right, right.
Interviewer:
They just have to save them even if they might not want them.
Interviewee6:
Exactly.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee6:
Right, right, right.
Interviewer:
So you said you had experience in this with your grandmother, could you describe what you feel like hoarding disorder looks like and how you know when somebody has it?
Interviewee6:
Well you mean in her case?
Interviewer:
In any case, yeah, or wherever you have experience with it?
