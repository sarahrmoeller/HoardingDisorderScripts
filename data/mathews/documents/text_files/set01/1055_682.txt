Participant:
Well, in the living room I have tons and tons of papers. Just paperwork that I’ve got to go through and see if there’s anything important I need to keep. And, at this point, other papers have gotten mixed up with the papers, like, from my mother’s house that I’ve got to work on going through. And, uh, the garage and… it’s just, uh, stuff I brought from my mother’s that I need to take a second look at while I’m going through things. So, the same way with the [INAUDIBLE] and the two out-buildings. It’s just stuff that I need to just, take the time to go through and kind of decide what’s what.
Interviewer : Right. So, how about any like objects in your house? Are there any, are there any objects that you can't use the way they're supposed to be used? Like, maybe you can't use a stove because there's stuff on top of it? Or, maybe a bedroom or, you know, anything like that?
Participant:
Well, the office you can't use very well because of all the boxes. Um…
Interviewer : But that's about it for you? Other than that, nothing else?
Participant:
That’s pretty much it at the moment.
Interviewer : Right. Okay, so, ideally, what would you like your home to look like?
Participant:
All organized, clean, um… not chaos everywhere.
Interviewer : So, a lot of people find comfort in, you know, the things that they keep. But, it sounds like to me, that for you, it's more of a stress to have all these things, and you don't really have like personal attachments per se to them, but you just haven't gotten around to, you know, sorting through them. Is that about right?
Participant:
Well, I do have some, some uh… personal value, where I would say things like from your childhood that you want to keep. And, I mentioned I’m staying at my mother’s house right now. It’s a three-bedroom house, and two of the bedrooms, uh… I’m having to sleep on the couch because two of the bedrooms you can’t get into. Because of all— you can’t you can’t walk in the bedrooms. One of the bedrooms has a mattress and back spring but they’re up against the wall. You can’t walk inside the door. Uh, so I guess I come through this naturally.
Interviewer : Mhmm. So, when you were growing up was your mom a hoarder, you know, when you were a kid, or did this develop later?
Participant:
She was a hoarder also.
Interviewer : Okay, so you definitely saw some of this behavior when you were growing up.
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer : Right. And, did it ever cause any conflicts between her and her husband, or her and any of her friends?
Participant:
Well, between her and her husband. But she was always able to use the excuse that she worked and, you know, um…
