Interviewee:
The memories that I have associated with them.
I have some head scarves that my grandma gave me, and my grandma passed away three years ago.
She gave them to me when I was in high school and I still have them, and then pictures.
I have a stuffed animal from when I was five.
I got it for my fifth birthday.
It's on my bed right now.
So, yeah.
It's like the emotions that you have attached to them and then the different memories that you have with them, like some nail polishes, like, "Okay, this is a color that my mom likes or my grandma," she would've liked different things like that, or, "This is some jewelry or a bag that my grandma gave me or my mom gave me."
Interviewer:
Okay.
So the memories associated and all the emotions associated with the object makes them more valuable.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So the opposite side of that is what is trash for you?
What do you discard and how do you know when it's time to get rid of something?
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE], like I'm learning if I don't wear it or if I'm not that size, then it doesn't make any sense.
I'm a 16/18 now.
Of course I don't want to be that size forever.
I've been that size for several years now, but it doesn't make any sense for me to keep [INAUDIBLE] size 10 or a size 12 because I'm not that size yet.
[INAUDIBLE], and then trash.
I know what's trash.
I'm not holding onto used tissues or anything like that, or if something rips and it can't be fixed, I'm not keeping it.
If it's something that's raggedy, I'm not going to keep it because, yeah.
I like a lot of things, I like to have a lot of things, but I like quality items.
I don't hold onto things that look raggedy.
Yeah, I don't do that.
CROSSTALK hold onto cheap things.
Interviewer:
Okay.
That's just in there because some people have a hard time processing the value of something CROSSTALK-
Interviewee:
Right.
I understand.
Yeah, no. This is for people on very different spectrums, so of course I understand.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So our next set of questions is what is the most precious item in your house for you, and why is it valuable?
Interviewee:
Wow, that's hard.
My most precious items?
Interviewer:
Yeah.
So if you could choose one, like if your house was on fire and you have to grab one thing, what would you have?
Interviewee:
Probably, what would be the one thing ...?
Probably my purse because it has my passport, my ID ... something identification-wise.
I'm just thinking about like, "Okay, what's something I'm really going to need?" I could just take my cellphone.
I don't know.
My cellphone?
That has everything on it, but now I'm like, "Okay ..."
Yeah, my cellphone.
