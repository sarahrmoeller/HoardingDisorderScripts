Interviewer:
No, that makes sense. Okay. The next section is kind of talking about the disorder itself, and so what do you think the most important differences between what's considered normal saving behaviors, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?
Participant 021:
The difference between normal behavior and hoarding disorder?
Interviewer:
Yeah, like normal saving behavior, like a collector, and then hoarding.
Participant 021:
Well, I think one of the main differences is the satisfaction, like I say, that I get from buying something. I don't quite understand this, but you do get... I get some satisfaction and sometimes from just purchasing something.
To give you an example, last week I was playing around on the computer. I saw on YouTube a picture of a drone. I already have two or three drones. Some of them are still unopened. This guy was describing one, and he was showing it and how easy it is to fly, and their price wasn't real expensive. I think it was only $100, and it's like I just said, "What the heck? I'm going to order it." So I went ahead and ordered it. It hasn't come yet, but it's like... and it gave me a good feeling, so I think that feeling is the difference. 
I collect coins, but I don't get that... I get a feeling, but the coins, there's a potential there that maybe you'll get something that has a lot of value. With a drone I enjoy purchasing it, but I know it's never going to have a lot of value. The coins, even though I do enjoy them, it's sort of different because the potential is there. You read about a 1909 VDB penny is auctioned off for a million dollars. So there are some coins that are worth a lot of money, and you never know. You might accidentally, somebody might be selling something they don't realize. Especially you see those at auctions. Sometimes someone passes away and they have a collection of old coins, and the wife will just say, "Hey, I don't know anything about those. I want to just sell them all off." So that has potential.
I think that's the difference between a collector and a hoarder. A hoarder does it because he gets that really good instant [inaudible 00:47:06] from just buying something, where the collector does it because there's a potential there and a little bit of an excitement as you go through the coins, of hoping that you'll discover something that has a lot of value to it.
Interviewer:
Okay. That makes sense. They kind of have, like collectors are kind of more specific and on one thing.
Participant 021:
Oh, sure. I think collectors, they take the time. I just play around with it. It's a hobby. But it's kind of interesting to see some of these things and learn... Like, Kennedy half dollars, 1964 Kennedy half dollars, are about 70% silver, and people hoard those because they at one point they were melting them down because the silver was worth more than the half dollar. So for a while I was going to the bank and ordering 500 Kennedy half dollars in rolls, hoping that I would get 1964 half dollars. Not that I'm going to melt them down, but they are valuable because everybody that's into coin collecting knows about them, and you can sell them online for probably 20 bucks a piece.
Interviewer:
Okay. What does hoarding disorder look like, and how is it different or the same from your behavior?
