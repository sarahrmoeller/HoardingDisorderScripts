Interviewer:
It's kind of this idea of need and if you or someone else will need it?
Participant 042:
Yes, exactly.
Interviewer:
On the other side of that question, what is trash for you? What do you discard and how do you know when it's time to get rid of something?
Participant 042:
Wow, that's a good question. Oh my. Plastic. I had this thing that I don't like anymore plastic. I did live with a person for four months, it was everything has to be in plastic, and I was just like, "No. I'm not going to buy or use any of the one time use plastic if I can help it." What's the other thing? I know the plastic is the main thing. There's got to be something else. I'll come up with it. Probably anything that's really outdated. I have correspondence from 30 years ago. It's ridiculous. Somebody handed me stuff that was mine from 30 years ago. I said, "Wait a minute." That's not good. I'd rather be mobile and not have that stuff follow me around. I guess anything outdated and totally irrelevant.
Interviewer:
When you say irrelevant like outdate, is that like outdated clothes, appliances or just like is something that's not necessarily useful to you anymore?
Participant 042:
That's true. Well, I say I'm writing a book about my life, then I don't get very far, because it's based on letters I lost, letters I got back, letters I wrote, and letters somebody found and sent back to me. It doesn't get... Some of that stuff from 30 years ago, I think it probably just has to go out the window and into the garbage, but there it is. I think, yeah, but it's going in the book. I'm going to write the book. 
Interviewer:
It's kind of this like you're torn between keeping something because it's for a project, but it's kind of been around so long that it's not necessarily valuable anymore.
Participant 042:
Someone else in line, I couldn't believe it. Why did you save that? Then I thought, "Well, let's examine it." It something I need help with and I don't have a clue really about... Maybe it's a calming effect when I can go through something and say this is how I was before, this is a letter of proof that I did this and I did that. Maybe I just convince myself that it need not be garbage.
Interviewer:
Out of every single item, what is the most precious item in your house for you?
