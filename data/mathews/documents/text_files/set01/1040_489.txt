Interviewee:
I would have to shove things aside if someone came.
The top of the bookcase would not be loaded with books.
There might be something pretty on it, but no, it's got more books.
There's no room for pretty.
No knickknacks around.
My children did tell me I didn't have any pictures around, photographs.
So I had opportunity to get some photographs.
My younger daughter's wedding, she presented me with pictures of everybody who attended the wedding, the family.
And from there, I started to put other little pictures.
That's now almost 13 years old.
And the pictures of my grandchildren and my in-laws and such.
Interviewer:
So it sounds-
Interviewee:
That's very neat.
There is one knickknack.
I didn't get an angel put away, so an angel's there and there's a box of candy.
Interviewer:
So-
Interviewee:
[INAUDIBLE] covered.
Interviewer:
So overall, ideally, you would like to be able to have people be able sit on your living room couch, and you'd like to be able to put out some decorations and stuff like that, but those are things that you just can't do.
Interviewee:
Yeah, not too much, not too much.
Interviewer:
Got you.
Interviewee:
Because they're dust catchers.
Interviewer:
Right.
Interviewee:
But just the idea that I could.
I've got some really nice pieces of Maud Humphrey figurines.
I owned a store for a while, and I've got a couple of those, and I should put those out.
Interviewer:
Are there parts of your home that you don't currently use?
So it sounds like the kitchen stays pretty clean because of your husband.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
And it sounds like the bathroom is pretty clean as well.
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
So are there any parts of your house that can't be used the way that they were meant to because of things being on them or stuff like that?
Interviewee:
The dining room table, the dining room, we added an addition on the back to give us a dining room so that my mother and my family, both families, my daughter's families, you have 13, 14 around the table, and there would be no way.
This is a small house, one of those starter houses that people get into, you know when they have kids, or one young child.
And we finished off the basement, which gave us some more room.
But without that room back there...
I've sort of taken it over too with stacks of fabric and stacks of things that I haven't quite gotten around to.
What's known in the sewing/quilting trade is UFOs, unfinished object CROSSTALK.
UFOs, unfinished objects.
Interviewer:
That's funny.
I haven't heard that before.
Interviewee:
And there are a few of those in there.
I look at it and I say, "Hmm, I'm tired," or I'll do part of a cleaning project and give up, never quite get back to finishing picking up.
Interviewer:
Got you.
