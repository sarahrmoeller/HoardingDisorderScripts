Interviewer:
All righty.
I was wondering if you could start.
We're going to do these things that are called free listing prompts, but before we get started with that, I just wanted to ask what term you would prefer when you're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding.
Participant 27:
Would you say that again please?
Interviewer:
Sure.
Do you have a specific term you would prefer when we talk about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?
Participant 27:
No, I don't have any problem with it.
However you want to call it.
I think that I have both, but it's not a problem for me.
Interviewer:
Okay, do you like the term hoarding or do you prefer a different one?
Participant 27:
No, hoarding is fine.
I tell people I'm a hoarder.
Actually, I am a collector.
Interviewer:
A collector.
Would you prefer me to use the term collecting?
Participant 27:
I really don't care.
You can use whatever you want.
It does not bother me.
Interviewer:
Okay, that's good to know.
I know some people do have preferences, so we want to be cognizant.
Participant 27:
No, I'm proud of both.
Interviewer:
Gotcha.
I think I have a good picture.
Thank you for that.
Now, we're going to go through some more standard questions.
You've described a few different things that you collect.
How long has this been going on for you?
Participant 27:
I would say that I hoarded when I was a child.
I came from a family with my dad was extremely abusive, physically, emotionally and sexually.
Interviewer:
I'm sorry to hear that.
Participant 27:
I'm sorry, what?
Interviewer:
I just said I'm sorry to hear that.
Participant 27:
Yeah, that was not good.
I think that I recall hoarding my Halloween candy or anything that I got.
I felt like it was not safe if it was out in the open, so I would hide it.
To this day, there are silver dollars from the 1800s that my grandfather that gave me that are buried under a tree in my backyard in New Jersey.
I don't know where they are, but anyway...
I remember burying them.
I hid my grandmother's wedding ring.
When she died, that's what they gave me.
I was probably around 10, and I hid that in a board in the house.
I never recovered that.
I think I've been doing this my whole life.
It's just that at this point, I have a very large house, and we're putting another addition on it.
I have a second house, so I have room for these things.
I also have a barn.
I have a four-car garage, so I have a lot.
Interviewer:
Okay, so lots of spaces.
Participant 27:
I have lots of space, yes.
