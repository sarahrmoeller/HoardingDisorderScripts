Interviewer:
Has it ever before maybe gotten in the way of something you really wanted to do, like have a new friend over or anything like that?
Participant 30:
Yeah. One of the organizations that I'm active in was having a volunteer appreciation party, and it would have been appropriate for me to host it, but I knew that there was no way that that I was ready for that. So I asked someone else to host it. It doesn't have serious affects on my day to day life. It's just kind of always there. It's always this thing hanging over me that I really need to sit down and go through all of this stuff, and clean out that room, and organize things.
But there's always some other, more pressing thing that needs to be done, and it's easy to just put it off. I think procrastination, I think that's something, at the very beginning when you're having the bullet list, I think procrastination is a big... I tend to procrastinate, and I think that's a big contributor to it.
Interviewer:
Okay. I know you said that your husband, who you live with, is quite understanding, and that there was a time in which it did cause some conflicts with your mom, but other than that, have you every experienced any sorts of impact of the clutter problems on your romantic relationships or your family relationships, other than the ones you've already told me?
Participant 30:
No, I don't think so.
Interviewer:
Okay. Back to your husband, you said that he's very understanding of it. So what does that look like for you?
Participant 30:
It look likes, he's not... He's a little bit sloppy. He doesn't always put everything away, but I think he, but he's not as bad as I am, and I think he tolerates it because, to him, the benefits outweigh the irritation or whatever. We have a good relationship. We're older, but we've only been married like 22 years, this year. 
I think he would be happy if I cleaned everything up, but as long as... I think he's able to tolerate it because he's basically happy otherwise, I think.
Interviewer:
How about any sorts of impacts on your work or your career? Has there ever been anything like that? 
Participant 30:
I don't think it ever effected my work. I've been retired for about 10 years, but I don't think, I wouldn't say that it ever effected work. I always had a messy desk at work, but it wasn't really that much worse than a lot of people's. There's always a couple people that have, always, absolutely neat desk. And that was never me, but it was never really a problem. It never effected my work, I don't think.
Interviewer:
Okay. You would ideally though like to change your behavior, if not because it's impacted any relationships, but mostly just like for personal reasons, you feel personally motivated to change it?
