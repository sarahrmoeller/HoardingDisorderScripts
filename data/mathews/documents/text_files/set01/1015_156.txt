Interviewer:
So all the reasons that someone might want to seek treatment would be they can't move around their house.
They're criticized about their mess, family pressures, and maybe they can't locate certain items because there's just too much stuff around.
Interviewee:
Right.
I guess also to add to it would be that something begins not working, a sink, or a toilet, or something.
So the house becomes unfunctional in a lot of ways and that forces them to seek help.
Interviewer:
Okay.
All right.
So for the complete list so far, I have, they can't move around their house, they're criticized about their mess, they have pressures from their family.
They can't find stuff and then their house might be home on functional, things might break and then they're not able to fix them.
Would you like to anything else?
Interviewee:
Nope.
Interviewer:
All right.
So that completes the free listing portion of the interview.
And the next section is kind of more conversation style, and it's just broken into a few different topics.
So this first one is going to be behavior and treatment seeking.
So can you please describe your clutter problems and how long they've been going on.
Interviewee:
From me?
I would say...
We moved here 22 years ago, so maybe 20 years ago it began to get easy just to settle in and not have to throw things away so much.
And I wouldn't say it's a horrible problem for me, but I do keep more than what I really probably ought to and what else?
Interviewer:
Okay.
So you said it started about 20-ish years ago.
Interviewee:
Yeah, I would say.
Interviewer:
Is there any specific reason why you think it started or you just got settled in a permanent home?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I think that was it.
Prior to that we had moved a number of times and we had smaller houses than we do now.
And so with moving and not having the space, I think you tend to just get rid of things as you have to.
Although there's things that I've...
My youngest child is now 26 and for all those years I've had the crib for instance.
And I finally just turned it into...
Got rid of the mattress and put the frame up for some shelving down the basement for toys for the grandkids.
So that was something that I probably could have gotten rid of what 24 years ago, but I didn't, and I don't know why I didn't.
Interviewer:
Did you have any problems when you were a child at all, growing up?
Interviewee:
No. I would say I had a happy childhood.
My mom stayed at home.
My dad worked kind of a traditional style.
I was the oldest of five and I think we had enough food and good shelter and stability.
I don't know maybe because I was the oldest of five and afraid that my brothers and sisters were going to take my stuff, maybe that's what kind of plays into it, I don't know.
