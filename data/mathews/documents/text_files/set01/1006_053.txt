Interviewer:
I was going to ask what you thought would have been progress for you, or baby steps?
Participant 006:
Well, I think I made progress with the books. I am trying to go through the sewing room, and cleaning out stuff. But every time I look at something, I think I can use that. I really need to just decide, I could replace this if I needed to, so it's okay to let it go now to someone who could use it. I just have a hard time. I know logically what should be done, but emotionally, it's very, very difficult for me. 
Interviewer:
Yeah, that's a good answer. Yeah. Part of throwing things away is that they won't be able to be used anymore, and that'll just be the end of the item's life cycle. 
Participant 006:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
So you would rather give them away to someone where it can still continue to get used?
Participant 006:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Thrift stores and places like that, would that make you feel better if you gave your stuff away to thrift stores instead of throwing it away? 
Participant 006:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay, good. Back to the vignette, do you think that the person's behavior is similar or different to your own? 
Participant 006:
Similar. 
Interviewer:
Similar? Okay. In what ways? 
Participant 006:
Well you mentioned antiques in this vignette. I do have some things that are, like I said, I have a lot of collections that I kind of treasure. But I know that to somebody else they're probably valueless. Although, I also know there are other people like me that might want them. I just know that, I guess they're providing emotional support to me in some way, or I wouldn't bother with them. Because I have friends who have no difficulty when something's been used and they're done with it, they just toss it. Even though I see value in it. 
Interviewer:
Right. 
Participant 006:
They don't have any trouble letting go. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 006:
I do, and I don't understand that. 
Interviewer:
Yeah. You would definitely say that it's more emotional? 
Participant 006:
Yeah. 
Interviewer:
Okay good. So you can recognize when something has reached the end of its use and you still wouldn't want to throw it away? 
Participant 006:
That is correct. 
Interviewer:
I know you mentioned that you wanted to get sewing back again. What if it was a sewing machine that had broken, and it was beyond repair? Would you be willing to throw that away? Or do you think that you would still try to get some use out of it? 
Participant 006:
Yeah, I would pass it along. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
