Interviewer:
Okay. The opposite side of that question is, what do you consider trash and what do you throw away? Do you know when it's time to get rid of something?
Interviewee:
Well, one of the problems with throwing away things is I really believe, strongly, in recycling and reusing, so it's very difficult for me to just throw something away. In fact, I have a broken scale that used a nine volt battery, but the battery, I mean, it's years old and the battery had rusted onto the gizmo that the nine volt battery hooks into. It has the two round things on the end that snap. So, it's unusable. You can't get a weight without the battery and the battery is rusted onto the ends of it, and I checked with the local head. You can't recycle things like scales or a coffee pot that doesn't work anymore.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
You have to throw them away and I haven't been able to do that because I just think there should be something better to do with it. It's very strange.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
You'll be dealing with a lot of strange people.
Interviewer:
When it comes to discarding, you have difficulties throwing something away because you really believe in recycling and when you don't find the right place, you just hold onto it for when something will change?
Interviewee:
Yeah, probably, or just ...
Interviewer:
A guilt thing?
Interviewee:
One of the problems, as I said, I have something called spinal stenosis, which I didn't know till late last year, and it has impacted my ability to walk and to stand, and when you are sorting things and going through things, you have to be just, generally, standing up.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
So, about 10 minutes is my limit for standing up and instead of saying, "Okay, I'll take a break for 20 minutes and come back to it," I'll do 10 minutes and stop. That's an issue that I have.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah, sounds like it would be very difficult. You mentioned that you do think you have too much stuff and that you know that you need to be getting rid of some things, but what would you consider your most precious item in your house for you?
Interviewee:
Probably the photographs and there's a box of photographs. Then, I have a vase that my daughter made for me. Sentimental things. There's an ornament from kind of close to where I grew up that a relative was involved in, starting a Christmas Eve choir of men that go around and sing. They still do it. 170 years later, they're still going around the town and singing the Christmas carols on Christmas Eve. They start at midnight and go all night. I have an ornament from that. So, that is something that I want my children and grandchildren to appreciate. I guess it's things that I would want my family to, maybe appreciate is the wrong word. Maybe that's my problem, is a I appreciate it too much.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
