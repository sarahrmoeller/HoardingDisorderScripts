Interviewee:
So I'm not one of these old guys who are going to get dementia because I'm always looking for something that I can't find.
So that keeps my memory fairly sharp.
So it's kind of a lesson in disguise, but I'm not giving myself credit for having so much clutter that I have to remember where everything is, but it does help to have a good memory.
I can go to my garage and sometimes I can find things that I remembered that have been there for 10, 15, 20 years.
And like I told you earlier, I don't have to go out and buy a new ratchet saw or something.
I have one already and I remember where it is.
And some of my family finds that they say, "Gee, you're amazing Len, that you can remember all this."
They're always telling me that.
I say, "Well, if you have all this junk that I have, you got to have your memory good."
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
So that keeps my family at bay and they admire me for having the memory to keep track of all this stuff, which a lot of people can't keep track of.
They just go, "Oh my God, how do you keep track of all that stuff?" I said, "Well, it's all in my memory, but I don't want it to be there.
I wish I had all this stuff that keeps in my memory."
It bogs me down, it ties me down.
I'm memory bound as they say.
So that's the answer to that question, I'm memory bound by having all this stuff, which I don't want to be memory bound.
I want to be able to free my memories from holding on to years and years of accumulation so that I could be a little bit freer in my memory.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Yeah.
Can you go ahead and please describe where you live now, such as do you live alone or what does-
Interviewee:
Pardon me?
You're not coming through that loud and clear.
I don't know how I am on your end but-
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Go slower.
