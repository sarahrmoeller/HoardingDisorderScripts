Interviewer:
Yeah. No, I get it. You mentioned briefly that you said lived rurally. How big is your house? How many rooms are in it?
Participant 013:
It's like 2500 square feet or so plus the basement. We have a big great room area, blah, blah, blah, then two bedrooms and a bath upstairs, two bedrooms and a bath downstairs, and then a big den downstairs. So I have for instance, one of the rooms is my office but it's all full of stuff. But it's getting organized. I have now boxes with these are all stuff that's listed on eBay. This is all stuff that I'm going to list once I get to it. This is all stuff that needs to go.
The other thing is with the pandemic, now all of our festivals for the summer are canceled. I usually do several flea markets and that kind of thing. But again, I haul all this stuff here, maybe I sell 10% or a quarter of it, it makes me feel really good because I'm like, I got rid of all that stuff and I made a few dollars. I haul the rest back and I'm like, this is so much work and it's just crazy. But it's like I don't have a choice though.
Interviewer:
All right. Which living areas would you say are cluttered? How cluttered are they? Can you walk through them? Or is it kind of like you only have a narrow pathway to get into those rooms?
Participant 013:
It's just basically like, well, the basement, which was just a nightmare, full to the rafters recently. But like I said, the last few months I've really been making a dent in it. So now it's kind of good because you can walk around. It's nice for my partner because he's had this workbench down there and he needs to go down there once in a while for stuff. Now it's a little bit better at least for him. So made some strides down there.
I do have one whole room that could be a bedroom, which we don't need as a bedroom. But it's very full. Like I said, at least it's kind of starting to get organized full. I know what everything is. We have separate bedrooms because I snore really badly. So my room is not bad, my room's okay, it could be a little neater. But otherwise, no, everything else is okay. We have a nice guest room, he has his bedroom, the bathrooms are fine. The little den is fine, the living area's fine.
Interviewer:
Okay, so it's mostly-
Participant 013:
Honestly, if he wasn't here, it probably would be worse. He's very diligent about making sure I keep things that way and he keeps things.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like mostly you just have the basement and then one room that are kind of cluttered. But everything else is pretty neat.
Participant 013:
Yeah.
