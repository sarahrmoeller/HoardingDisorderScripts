For a while, the living room, the one area of the house that I could let people into and not be embarrassed by clutter, I had boxes that I had not unpacked.
Stuff that sat there for a month, and then I guess, two weeks ago, I finally went, enough, this is ridiculous, unpack everything, recycle, flatten the boxes out, put them out in the recycle bin, et cetera, et cetera, and dealt with it.
I'm going, yeah, yay, you did something.
Interviewer:
You went through a period with COVID where, when there were all the shortages, you decided that it was time to stock up.
Then you stocked up and found that you didn't necessarily need all the stuff you'd stocked up on, and it was just piling up and building up around your house.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Then there were unrelated, the COVID just impulse buying.
Oh, this looks cool.
Interviewer:
I can relate to that.
When you're stuck at home all day, you don't have that much to do, it can be easy to creep back on Amazon.
Interviewee:
Absolutely.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like you have been able to discard anything during this period, or do you feel like your getting rid of stuff-
Interviewee:
No. In fact, I've been beating myself up about that, that it's like, Interviewee, there's just no excuse for all the mess you've got around here, because you've got the time, you've got the physical ability to deal with it, and you're not.
That frustrates me.
Interviewer:
It's been easy to be hard on yourself about that as well.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
The only positive thing is usually when I'm beating myself up about something, I overeat.
I haven't been doing that.
Interviewer:
Good for you.
That is a positive.
Interviewee:
I didn't pick up the COVID 15.
Woo.
Interviewer:
Amazing.
That's great.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
That's an evolution for me.
Interviewer:
Definitely.
Interviewee:
Anyway.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like COVID has impacted your depression or your mental health more broadly?
Interviewee:
Yeah, because again, it's given me more unstructured time.
I recognize that, and back in, I guess it was late April or early May, a call went out for contract employees to be hired as contact tracers.
Since I'm an RN, I was a pretty desirable commodity, and went to work as a contact tracer, and started in mid-May.
No, it was second week in May, I guess it was, for the county.
It was four 12s and three 12s, and I'm going, I'm 71, and this is ... I can deal with this.
This is great.
