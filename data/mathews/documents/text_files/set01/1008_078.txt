Interviewer:
Gotcha. Okay. And then, here's the next one.
John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.
He is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later.
Stacks of boxes occupy every room.
Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes.
His house is extremely cluttered, and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.
Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet.
So, he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.
He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
What do you think about this person?
Participant 008:
Yeah, definitely a disorder.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, why do you think this person has it versus that person that doesn't?
Participant 008:
Just from the impact on his quality of life.
Interviewer:
Okay.
And where do you see yourself in between these two people?
Participant 008:
Pretty close to the first one.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 008:
But not ...
Maybe on the surface it looks very similar, but when I'm hearing the two stories what is not being described, it's all from an outsider's perspective.
Interviewer:
Sure.
Participant 008:
And there's no sense of the inner emotional state of either John Doe, and I think that that inner emotional state probably is tied to why, for one, he values the boxes so much more than he values other things.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 008:
Like being able to get into his bathroom.
Interviewer:
Right.
Participant 008:
And that's probably the key point, is that internal value system, how out of whack is that relative to just being...
Interviewer:
Yeah, that makes sense.
Definitely.
Participant 008:
You have sort of practically function in life in that sense.
Interviewer:
So, it's the quality of life.
Participant 008:
On the surface I'd look like number one, but I probably have all that stuff of number two.
Interviewer:
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Participant 008:
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Just the difference in severity.
Definitely.
Participant 008:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay, I've got two more.
Let's see.
John Doe has books and papers, papers from school and things that are from the past, that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future.
These items occupy most of his rooms, except for the kitchen and his bedroom.
Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.
Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
When this happens, he is usually late to getting where he needs to be.
So, what do you think about this one?
Participant 008:
Definitely disorder.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Okay.
And then, this last one.
And why do you think that, really quick?
Participant 008:
Again, it's affecting his daily life.
He can't take a shower without moving stuff around.
