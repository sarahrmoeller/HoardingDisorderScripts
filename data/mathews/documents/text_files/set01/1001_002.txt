Participant 1:
The fact that I'm going to use them again. I mean, there's some left-in valuable memories, memories that are attached to them. And sometimes clothes that I can't wear anymore, I won't give them away just because they've got memories attached to them. Or I think maybe someday I'm going to wear them. But I have two full closets full of clothes. I've given some stuff away. I give stuff away all the time to Goodwill, but I still have tons of stuff. I have more stuff that I could ever use.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And so what do you think is trash for you? What would you discard?
Participant 1:
I clean my bird cage every day and discard the papers under the cage. I throw away bottles after I use them. We recycle things down here, so I get rid of stuff all the time. Everyday I throw out bottles that I use. Newspaper. But I usually recycle the newspaper and use it. Food and discarded food. And then I throw things away after they're just beat up. I throw away purses. I throw away clothes when they're worn out. And a lot of times I'm given things as gifts that I hold onto out of probably more ... what's the word I want to use? I feel bad because I don't like them, but I hold onto them, you know?
Interviewer:
Yeah. Uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.
Participant 1:
But I shouldn't do that. I should just get rid of them. I wish I was a better ... just go through and just say, "I haven't worn this anymore. Get rid of it." But I mean there are things that I've made. I took tailoring and I made coats that I know I'll never wear them again but I worked on my ass off on them, right? So they're still in my closet. So things that I've worked really hard on that mean something even though I don't wear them, they're there to bring a memory to me about something because as I get older, my memory is bad and sometimes I need tangible objects. I'm more of a spacial person.
And so the way I work well if I have papers laid all out and I look at them and when I'm interviewing on the phone, I have my resume and I've got bios on the people that I'm working on and I've got something hold up or I'm looking online to see if they've written something that would be interesting in the conversation. I just pull. I pull from a lot of different things. That's kind of the way I operate.
