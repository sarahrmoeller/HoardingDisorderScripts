Interviewer:
Okay. We just have one left. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows their valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he finds them or forgets what he's looking for. He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and, sometimes, he does not show up at all. 
Participant 007:
He, obviously, has a disorder as well. That would be obsessive compulsive, wouldn't it? Where he has to have antiques since he's buying new antiques?
Interviewer:
Well, he could be a compulsive shopper. It would be hard to say it's OCD just from this one description, but it is possible. 
Participant 007:
Yeah. That's certainly very extreme and I'm, again, grateful. You're making me feel better about myself. Yeah, I can't relate this to that. I can relate to this thought of the antique thing, but I don't really have any valuable antiques. I have some things that have been in my mother's family, like my kitchen table from the farmhouse where she grew up, but I don't think there would be any value as far as selling it to antique dealers. 
Interviewer:
Okay. No, that's understandable. Okay. I think that we've covered everything. I'm just really quickly looking over all my questions just to make sure. Okay. I'm going to stop recording now. 
Participant 007:
All right.
