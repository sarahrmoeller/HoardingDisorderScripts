Participant 28:
What's that? Say it again?
Interviewer:
I need to redecorate my place now that you say that.
Participant 28:
Right.
Interviewer:
Now, I have a few last questions for you, and that's kind of the view on hoarding disorder in others and how you would distinguish hoarding disorder from what people might call normal collecting or saving behavior. How would you distinguish between the hoarding and saving things?
Participant 28:
When it gets past the point where you could actually realistically use all of it, where you really can't rationalize anymore that you're going to use it. I mean, I kind of rationalize now that I like to look at these things I thought I was going to use someday, like all the metal pieces for welding, sculptures, and stuff like that. I have so many ideas in my head and I'm capable of making them but it's just not getting done, so I'm saving those things now because I like looking at them and imagining what it could become, and I can rationalize anymore. I'm saving them because they will become something, and some of them will, but certainly in my lifetime not all of them can.
Yeah, so it gets past a certain line of being able to really rationalize their usefulness, and I guess also when you can't use a space anymore that you would like to use, because it's covered with things that you are saving, that's a line where I judge myself.
Interviewer:
It also seems that you mentioned that once a space gets to be unattractive or a space that you don't really like anymore because of the accumulation of items, that seems to bother you too.
Participant 28:
Yeah, for sure.
Interviewer:
And do you think that your behavior fits that definition of hoarding disorder or do you think that your behavior is separate from that?
Participant 28:
Sorry, what definition of hoarding disorder are you asking about?
Interviewer:
Whenever you said that hoarding is when it gets past the point of being able to rationally justify using items, do you think that that fits a description of your behavior or that you haven't necessarily reached that?
Participant 28:
No, I think it does define my issues for sure.
Interviewer:
Okay. And then where have you mostly seen information on hoarding? Has it been through the television shows that you mentioned or any other resources?
Participant 28:
Hm. Probably originally through the television show, but I mean, years ago I went to university and the psychology department, I might have first learned about it there. And then working in the mental health field just the last 15 years with children, it's been an issue that I discuss with their therapist and stuff like that, often around food hoarding or their home environment. They might live with hoarders, so the concept has come up. Yeah.
