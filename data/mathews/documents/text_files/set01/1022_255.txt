Participant 022:
I really didn't save a whole lot of hers, a little bit, but not very much.
For my husband, I did most of it and for him, I don't think it was too hard for him either, but we did pack up a whole U-haul trailer full of stuff and brought it from California back here to Colorado.
We did save some stuff.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 022:
We got rid of most of it.
Interviewer:
Did it ever affect your work?
Participant 022:
My work?
No, mm-mm NEGATIVE.
Interviewer:
Did you have a desk or anything?
Was your office or desk clean at work?
Was it always organized or was it also really cluttered?
Participant 022:
Cluttered, cluttered.
Definitely.
Always cluttered, everything.
Interviewer:
Okay, Did anyone ever comment on it?
Participant 022:
No, I don't think so.
Not really.
Interviewer:
Okay.
I'm trying to think if I missed anything.
I think that we've covered everything.
Participant 022:
Oh, okay.
