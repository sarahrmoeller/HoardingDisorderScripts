Interviewer:
How do your family and your friends treat this behavior?
Does it cause conflict or are they understanding about it?
How does it impact your relationships?
Participant 019:
I think it bothers my wife that I can't be better, cleaner and more efficient.
It bothers my children, because they worry that we will never move, because we're victims of inertia.
But it does have, it has issues, problems, it creates problems with the people I love, and the need to have it around me when I can't do things.
Interviewer:
So it sounds like you're aware of the fact that it bothers them, maybe there isn't a lot of conflict in the sense of people being upset or angry about it actively, but you know that your children are worried about it and that it bothers your wife.
Does that sound right?
Participant 019:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Could you describe for me your house?
It sounds like your house is a big part of your personal identity, and I wonder if you could just tell me about it.
What is your house like?
What does it look like?
What do you like about it?
Participant 019:
The house that we rebuilt after the fire has many spaces, and of course, we also added on.
My wife became employable with her nursing, and so we've developed a fairly large house that has four bedrooms and three-and-a-half baths.
It's just perfect for us, as far as an open floor plan.
We like the way it was redesigned by the architect.
The grounds, we constantly are putting money, especially with the need to not travel, because we tend to travel quite a bit.
We've traveled, bicycled across Europe and across America.
So constantly thinking about spending money on travel, that budget has now been devoted to our house.
We've worked to make our landscaping much more enjoyable, the patio and stone wall and just the gardens, and just enjoying the nature now.
So the house is a great source of pride, but it's also a source of maintenance for it too.
There are resources that we have to think about addressing.
Interviewer:
Makes sense.
It sounds lovely.
Participant 019:
It's a wonderful ...
Of course, we're in an environment, we're in a fairly rural area of Northern New Jersey, it's well educated and healthy, and is very attractive bicycling.
We can go out and bicycle for 60 miles in horse country, and beautiful valley, creek valleys and high up mountains, hills and feel good about having climbed it, and go down.
It's a thrill to be able to bicycle and be healthy.
Interviewer:
That's great.
Participant 019:
So we've very happy with our lives right now, and our finances are very good with two pensions and Social Security.
Interviewer:
So you're secure and you sound like you are in a very idyllic location, and your home is exactly the way you and your wife designed it to be and built it to be.
