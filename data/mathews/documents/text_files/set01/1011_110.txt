Interviewer:
Yes. Can you please describe where you live now?
So what is the space like, or do you live alone currently?
How's your home looking right now?
Interviewee:
Well, my home is always a mess.
My home is a mess.
I'm just looking at my table here.
And there's two laptops and three iPods and I'm working on a stereo for a friend of mine who bought one at Goodwill and it was broken.
So I'm trying to fix it for him.
So therefore I got soldering arms and screws and things all over the place.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
It's a total mess.
You put your hands on your ears and go screaming out of the house.
But no, I inherited a house that was full of stuff.
And so I'm now living alone, but the house is a big house.
So it's very empty.
There's a lot of space available.
My partner was a bird fanatic, collected birds.
So I'm stuck with a bunch of doves and parakeets.
So it's like living in aviary.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewee:
I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff, but it's very difficult for me.
Like I told you, I don't really have a lot of help.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
It's so hard to get rid of live things and when you're attached to them.
And so it's more difficult to get rid of live things than it is inanimate objects, let me tell you.
It's easy to get rid of an old stereo, but try to get rid of a eight year old parakeet.
Find the right home for it, that's what I'm always trying to do.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Are there parts your home that you consider cluttered?
Or-
Interviewee:
Pardon me, but this house I'm in is not cluttered right now, other than my work table, everything else is neat.
And I've made a purpose for not cluttering this up.
My other house is just a mess, but this house I'm actually going to rent out.
That's why I try not to fill it up with junk.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
But I have been moving some of my stuff into this house, which is a bad sign, because that just means I'm going to clutter it up and I don't want to do it.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Are there objects that are most important to you?
Interviewee:
Pardon me?
Interviewer:
Are there objects that are most important to you?
Interviewee:
What's that word?
Interviewer:
Objects or possessions?
Interviewee:
Objects.
Interviewer:
Yes.
Interviewee:
No, I don't have any objects anymore.
I really don't hoard objects other than things I need, that I use every day.
And let me see, my dog is barking here and it's going to bark.
I think he has to go outside to the potty.
Interviewer:
Okay.
