Interviewer:
So, it sounds like you'd choose based on use?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
Would I be using this again, and I have this habit of wanting to take care of other people so it's like, "Oh, well this costume's cool.
It doesn't fit me but it might fit somebody who's over visiting and we might want to do something where we dress up so I can loan it to them."
So, it's like do I really need to take care of everybody else's costume needs or whatever?
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, when you think about how long this has been going on and stuff, you mentioned that you're starting to feel claustrophobic, does it upset you a lot and do you think it get in the way of your daily life?
Interviewee:
It doesn't upset me a lot, but I've noticed that I'm feeling this weight.
I have... it's just this low level dread or weight about having to deal with this, so it's not in the forefront in my mind, it's just in the background.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, you said you recently started feeling like this?
Interviewee:
It's been going on for a while where I'm feeling like I needed to start dealing with it, like for I'd say a couple years or so.
It might've been sparked with seeing my mother get sicker and realizing that there was a lot of stuff in her house, and my sister's and I starting to try to clean some of that out.
This is funny, I just thought of this, she kept things too.
Interviewer:
Oh. Interviewee:
So, I mean, she got really upset with me because we threw away a bunch of...
She had canned a bunch of fruits and vegetables and these things were 10 years old and unsafe to eat and my sister and I threw it all out and she got really upset with us.
I'm thinking, you know, that was totally an emotional attachment on her part.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, your mom kept a lot of things, did she just keep food items or was it a lot of clothes?
Interviewee:
She had quite a few clothes, but not too much.
I mean, she'd keep an old towel that would be pretty raggedy.
She was a child in the depression so it was really hard for her to feel like she had enough because she grew up pretty poor and it was like you had to really make do, so.
Interviewer:
But your father didn't do that?
He was very-
Interviewee:
No. No, my dad...
As soon as my mom died, I mean as soon as she died, he was moving into an independent living place and we went back to help and he was like, "Get rid of this, get rid of that, get this other thing.
Go, go, go," and he just moved just what he had needed.
He's got no problem with that at all.
Interviewer:
Okay.
It's very, like, contrasting views.
