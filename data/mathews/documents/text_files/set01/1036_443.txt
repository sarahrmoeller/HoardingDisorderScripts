Interviewer:
It sounds like when you were telling me about how this all developed, that while your wife was alive you were able to kep it a little bit more in-check because she wouldn't stand for it, does that sounds right?
Participant 036:
Pretty much.
She had a garage sale every six months or a year.
So if I really wanted stuff then I could by it back from her.
Interviewer:
I see.
So she was very active in getting rid of your stuff.
She was a big proponent of every six months she would go through and purge and if it meant that much to you, you'd have to pay for it.
Participant 036:
Yeah, exactly.
Interviewer:
And then after she passed, it sounds like your house just kind of filled up.
Participant 036:
That's exactly right, to tell you the truth, ma'am, this is something that somebody said in the '60s, if I could only tell who it was then I'd quote the person.
A man without a woman is like a ship without a rudder, but the woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle
Interviewer:
I see.
Participant 036:
And I said that all the time.
I hang out with some of the seniors settled here, educational groups for seniors.
They're bringing and asking me right now because of the virus, I remember seeing guys who came with us and just stumble around lost might not see anything that the ...
Here's the thing.
What it was when [INAUDIBLE] why don't you just keep on chugging and see what's ... that's her husband.
No, [INAUDIBLE].
CROSSTALK.
Interviewer:
No, it's the same.
Participant 036:
And I never realized how much stuff my wife did for me.
Christmas cards, birthdays, and stuff like that.
I never had a clue how much she was doing for me until she didn't do it anymore.
Interviewer:
I understand that, yeah.
So it sounds like you have it more or less under control now because you're living with your daughter and your son-in-law.
Participant 036:
It's just very limited, yes ma'am, but the physical constraints, yes ma'am.
Interviewer:
Did you ever try to ger help from either a professional?
Like see a psychologist or a professional organizer to help you to deal with this problem or was it something that you just dealt with on your own with your wife?
Participant 036:
I never thought of it as being the sort of a problem that might be amenable to improvement.
That never crossed my mind, till this conversation with you right now to be honest with you.
Interviewer:
Uh-huh AFFIRMATIVE.
So you just thought, "This is how I am and this is how I'll always be."
Participant 036:
Yep.
Interviewer:
And it's just a matter of how am I going to manage my stuff?
Participant 036:
Exactly.
