Interviewer:
What about if you think about-
Interviewee:
There may be-
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Go ahead.
You're kind of talking about monetary value.
Interviewee:
CROSSTALK
Interviewer:
Is that-
Interviewee:
Yes.
I think-
Interviewer:
Is that how you would make the decision?
Interviewee:
There seems to be a real difference between the generation of my brother's children and what I was like as a kid.
I don't know whether it's the availability of electronic resources or something like that.
They don't seem to have...
When I was a little girl, I really could admire the things that my aunt had that were beautiful.
There was some way in which I could appreciate them.
Maybe I was unusual.
I don't know.
Because I don't have...
Well, one of the things I discovered about myself just in this last year or so is that I'm somewhere along the autistic scale, what they call high function, and that a lot of this self analysis that you mentioned that I've done has helped me come to understand a lot of things.
I've learned a lot, because I'm older, and because I went to 12 step meetings for 30 years.
I learned a lot about how to deal with people, but I don't have a good sense of what other people would value, and I don't know whether that's connected to that.
I really don't.
I look around my house.
I've got a few paintings that I could imagine someone else might like but not much else.
Couldn't even tell you.
Interviewer:
Actually, when you reflect on it, you find that your possessions aren't even that important to you.
Interviewee:
Well, they matter to me, but I don't think that...
If I think about what I'd want to save, I can't imagine what would be that 10% somebody else might value.
Interviewer:
Well, what about you?
Let's think about this in a different way.
If you-
Interviewee:
Okay.
So I had to move into a retirement home, nursing home-
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Exactly.
How would you decide what to save?
Interviewee:
... or if I had to CROSSTALK a closet.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
I probably would take some of... I have still a few stuff animals.
When I got into Alcoholics Anonymous, and I'm also an atheist, I kept talking what is this higher power thing?
I don't know how to use this higher power.
Finally, somebody said, "Well, you can make a teddy bear be your higher power."
Well, so I did.
I went out and bought myself a teddy bear, and I slept with that teddy bear for 10 years, so I might take that with me.
I have a little stuffed hedgehog that I bought for myself a few years ago.
It's a little tiny thing.
And I might take that.
And of course, I would-
Interviewer:
So it sounds like you would make the decisions for yourself based on the sentimental value attached to the objects?
Interviewee:
I think that and as many books as I'd have room for, my meds.
I'd really be torn.
I use a lot of flower essences, and I'd be torn to have to make choices between those, but I think I could.
I think I've been working on this stuff long enough that, at this point, it wouldn't be as hard as I used to think it would be-
Interviewer:
That's great.
That's wonderful.
Interviewee:
... to make a lot of these choices.
