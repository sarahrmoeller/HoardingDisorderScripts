Interviewer:
Could you walk me through that process of deciding between things?
What is that like for you?
How do you make those kind of decisions?
Participant 020:
Make what kind of decisions?
What was the question?
Interviewer:
Decisions about which things are valuable and which things can be thrown away.
If you were to go through the process with the things in your house or the things in a particular box in your house, for instance, and you were to go through them, how do you decide if something is ready to be discarded?
How do you decide if it's time to throw something away?
Participant 020:
If I was having to imagine to move into one room, the clear criteria would be would I have room for it and would I ever be likely to want to look at it or read it or something again?
But if I'm just trying to think about getting rid of things now but staying here, I've actually gone quite a ways along the line of doing that, except for books and art.
I went through all my clothes about a year or so ago and got rid of the ones that I didn't like really, but now I'm left with a closet that still has three times as many clothes as I need, because I like every single piece.
Interviewer:
That makes sense.
Participant 020:
I figure as long as I have the room, I'm not going to be too hard on myself about that, but if I had to really downsize, I think I would be able to pick the clothes I'd be comfortable in.
I don't know.
It's a very interesting question, and I think that's partly the question I've been asking myself.
I had heart surgery back in March of '17, and I had to deal with a lot of issues that I didn't expect to have to deal with.
This whole question of how much time do I have?
Do I have time to use this?
Do I have room to use this?
Is anybody else ever going to want this?
I've really been thinking about all of that stuff tremendously.
Interviewer:
So you've really been thinking about-
Participant 020:
And of course-
Interviewer:
... the process of making a decision.
