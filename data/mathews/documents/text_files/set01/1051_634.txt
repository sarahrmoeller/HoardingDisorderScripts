Participant:
Yeah. I mean, I have paperwork and magazines and things like that that I need to throw all that out.
It's just really hard to do because I think, what if I need the article that’s in here?
Or, what if, you know, do I really need the, the car loan paperwork of a car that I haven’t owned in ten years.
I mean, I should be able to just throw that stuff out, and it's just really, really difficult.
Interviewer: Mhmm.
So, what would you say is the most precious item in your house?
Participant:
Other than my pets?
Interviewer: Mhmm.
Participant:
Um, if I were to say the most precious item, inanimate, it would probably be… a toss-up between… my yarn— I was going to say my photos.
But, to be perfectly honest, 90% of my photos are digitized and in the cloud now.
Interviewer: Mhmm.
Participant:
But yeah, it's really hard for me to throw away those prints.
Interviewer: Okay.
Participant:
And that's, and that's stupid.
You know, if I have, if I have scanned and digitized all of those school pictures and all of those things, and I have got them saved somewhere out in the ether, why can I not throw away the physical hard copy?
Interviewer: Right.
So, for you, it's mostly just worrying that you're going to need it in the future.
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer: Or maybe it's sentimental value?
Participant:
Yeah, it’s sentimental value.
But honestly, the most, the most valuable thing to be that's in my house right now for me personally, other than living things like my husband and my pets, would be my, my yarn.
I mean both physically and financially, that's probably the most valuable thing I have.
Interviewer: Okay.
So, I noticed you said financially, and I know we haven't really talked that much about whether things are important because they have financial value.
But, is that generally an important aspect for you when you're trying to decide if you should keep something or not?
Participant:
Sometimes.
Yeah, sometimes.
Sometimes I'll look at something and say, can I— you know, and my husband doesn't have this problem.
He'll, he'll find an old, you know an old piece of electronic equipment, like a radio receiver or something, and he has no problem just giving it away or calling a friend and saying, “Hey, do you want this?”, without any regard to its value.
You know, just give it to somebody because he doesn't want it.
And that's kind of where I‘d like to be.
Because I do look at things and say, oh you know, if I just had a yard sale I could probably sell this.
Well, the reality is I'm not going to have a yard sale.
I just have to, I have to, I just have to, I have to put my head on straight.
