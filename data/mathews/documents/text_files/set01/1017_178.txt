Interviewer:
Okay, so what about your kitchen or bathroom are those completely accessible?
Participant 17:
Bathroom, yes. And I've got it handicap accessible with the bars and the things for getting out of the tub. The bathroom counter is cluttered. The kitchen, the counter space has a lot of utensils on it, egg blender, a toaster, all kinds of kitchen gadgets because I love kitchen gadgets, so the counter space is really not usable. But you can walk around. 
Interviewer:
Okay. What would you like your home to look like, in an ideal world?
Participant 17:
In an ideal world I would like it to look like it did when I first moved in, before I started unpacking and adding and changing things, where I could easily walk around, easily choose a chair to sit in without having to move things, and be comfortable having people come in my house. I'm okay with having a room or two being a disaster, but using my living room as a sorting place was not a good idea because now my living room is a disaster. 
Interviewer:
Okay, so you'd just make the main living areas to be pretty clean and usable?
Participant 17:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 17:
And the amount time it would take to do so with my physical limitations, has impacted that tremendously. 
Interviewer:
Okay. How important are your things for you to feel at home, which things or which objects are the most important to you, and you spend the most time with?
Participant 17:
It's hard to answer. Books, photos, and rocks and crystals. 
Interviewer:
I'm sorry, what was that last one? 
Participant 17:
Rocks and crystals. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Those are the most important things for you to feel at home? 
Participant 17:
Yes. 
Interviewer:
So, if those got either donated or thrown away, you'd be most upset about those things missing. 
Participant 17:
Absolutely. 
Interviewer:
Okay. So the next section is about you. When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable? How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
Participant 17:
If it has... It's two things. Purpose, that it's useful, and secondly any associations that I may have with it, as to a person, a time, an event. 
Interviewer:
Okay. Then what is trash for you? What do you discard and when do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Participant 17:
I have a great difficulty with that. 
Interviewer:
Is there any example you can give me, even if it's the most simplistic. I just want to understand how you are thinking about these things. 
Participant 17:
Well, obviously left over food or rotten fruit, stuff like that. Typical trash. Something that has a memory of a time that I did not like, or that brings pain to me I would get rid of. Magazines that are over a couple of years old that I don't feel like pulling out pages from. 
Interviewer:
Okay.
