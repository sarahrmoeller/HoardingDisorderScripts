Interviewer:
Okay, so what about your kitchen or bathroom are those completely accessible?
Interviewee:
Bathroom, yes.
And I've got it handicap accessible with the bars and the things for getting out of the tub.
The bathroom counter is cluttered.
The kitchen, the counter space has a lot of utensils on it, egg blender, a toaster, all kinds of kitchen gadgets because I love kitchen gadgets, so the counter space is really not usable.
But you can walk around.
Interviewer:
Okay.
What would you like your home to look like, in an ideal world?
Interviewee:
In an ideal world I would like it to look like it did when I first moved in, before I started unpacking and adding and changing things, where I could easily walk around, easily choose a chair to sit in without having to move things, and be comfortable having people come in my house.
I'm okay with having a room or two being a disaster, but using my living room as a sorting place was not a good idea because now my living room is a disaster.
Interviewer:
Okay, so you'd just make the main living areas to be pretty clean and usable?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
And the amount time it would take to do so with my physical limitations, has impacted that tremendously.
Interviewer:
Okay.
How important are your things for you to feel at home, which things or which objects are the most important to you, and you spend the most time with?
Interviewee:
It's hard to answer.
Books, photos, and rocks and crystals.
Interviewer:
I'm sorry, what was that last one?
Interviewee:
Rocks and crystals.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Those are the most important things for you to feel at home?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
So, if those got either donated or thrown away, you'd be most upset about those things missing.
Interviewee:
Absolutely.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So the next section is about you.
When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?
How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?
Interviewee:
If it has...
It's two things.
Purpose, that it's useful, and secondly any associations that I may have with it, as to a person, a time, an event.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Then what is trash for you?
What do you discard and when do you know when it's time to throw something away?
Interviewee:
I have a great difficulty with that.
Interviewer:
Is there any example you can give me, even if it's the most simplistic.
I just want to understand how you are thinking about these things.
Interviewee:
Well, obviously left over food or rotten fruit, stuff like that.
Typical trash.
Something that has a memory of a time that I did not like, or that brings pain to me I would get rid of.
Magazines that are over a couple of years old that I don't feel like pulling out pages from.
Interviewer:
Okay.
