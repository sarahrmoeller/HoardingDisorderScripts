Interviewer : Right.
So, uh, when you were with your second husband then, keeping things was definitely an issue.
So, you felt couldn't keep things?
Participant:
Yeah, yep, yeah.
Interviewer : Okay.
So, how does that situation compare to now?
It sounds like you now have a little bit more freedom to have your own stuff.
Are you living in a different house, or has this situation changed?
Participant:
Well, my sister lives with me but it’s, it’s… She is, uh, a very judgmental person.
Interviewer : Mhmm.
Participant:
You know?
And, um, she is the reason I can't even wear my [inaudible; ] to check my medicine.
Interviewer : Right.
And why is that?
Participant:
Because she keeps [inaudible; ] it all the time.
You know?
Interviewer : Okay.
So, it seems like you kind of feel like other people definitely don't want you to have, you know, the amount of stuff that you have.
Has that always been a problem in your life?
How about your childhood?
Were your parents hesitant to let you keep things?
Participant:
Oh, no. As a kid everything was fine.
Yeah, yeah.
It was fine as a kid.
Interviewer : So, mostly in your adult life then, you felt like people—
Participant:
Well, wait.
Way back, I’ll give you an example.
I told my, my mother one day, “Judy is more my parent than you are because she’s up in my business all the time.”
Interviewer : Mhmm.
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer : So, for you, it's more important to, you know, have your independence, and your stuff is kind of like, uh… you’re, you’re tying some independence to your stuff, right?
Participant:
Right, right.
Interviewer : You don't want people to mess with your things?
Participant:
Yeah.
Interviewer : Okay, then I understand.
So, I know you said it started to cause some conflict between you and your sister.
But, uh, how about with your second husband, who you were talking about earlier?
Participant:
Uh, oh, what?
Repeat.
See, now I, I’m getting into [INAUDIBLE] my sister.
Interviewer : Mhmm, right.
Participant:
Um, how much, uh, because I’m afraid to say anything if they’ll hear it.
Interviewer : Yeah, no worries.
No worries.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Um, okay what was my question?
Interviewer : So, how about with your second husband?
Has it been some cause of some conflict between you and him?
Participant:
Um, no. I just, I couldn’t bring anything into the house.
Interviewer : Okay, so, at that point, if you couldn't bring things into the house, were you hoarding at all?
Participant:
I had, let me see… No, no. It wasn’t that bad at that time.
Interviewer : Okay, but now that you have kind of more freedom to have your stuff in your own space, what is your hoarding like, if you could describe it for me?
Participant:
Um… okay, ask me the question again.
