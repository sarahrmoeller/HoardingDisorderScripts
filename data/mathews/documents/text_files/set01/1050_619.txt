Participant 50:
Well, I think there is the expiration date on that possible. Because I won't go back and stay in there. I'm not going to get this. And if it's something that I think that it is in good shape and I know definitely would get it, or if I can donate it or something like that, then I'll do it that way. But yeah, so to a certain extent there are things that have expiration dates where I will go back and again be like "Man, you're not going to get that." Then I will change my mind and get rid of it.
Interviewer:
So there's kind of a limit on-
Participant 50:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
So if you were to explain it to someone who didn't know anything about these kinds of problems, how would you explain what you think the most important differences are between somebody who really has problems with hoarding and somebody who just saves stuff or who collect stuff or who just has a lot of things? What for you is the biggest difference?
Participant 50:
The difference would be I would tell that person it's part of being colorblind in the sense that you know that there are things that are different colors. However, physically are some kind of way chromosome is missing for you to be able to see clearly that this is the way to do things or that if this happens, it's going to accumulate to this. So it's part of being colorblind, it's something that you can't help. It's something that you're just wired a little bit differently and it doesn't decrease your value. It just means that there's something that stands in your way in order to see things clearer.
Interviewer:
So in the same way, somebody might be color blind, it's like being stuffed blind, or you just don't ... In the same way someone just is hardwired not to be able to see colors, you just can't see the kind of chain that will lead you to acquiring too much stuff and having too much stuff. Does that sound right?
