Participant:
Um… well, I buy them sometimes because I like the, um, the beauty of the work.
But I don't collect anything that's really expensive.
Interviewer : Mhmm.
Participant:
Yeah, I, I don’t normally do that.
And, then I’m doing a little better now because, um, I’ll go in, look at things, I’ll put maybe [INAUDIBLE] things, six things in the buggy, and then I will decide which one I have somewhere to put.
So, I am doing better with that little bit.
Interviewer : Gotcha.
So, when you say you're doing better, how does that compare to how it used to be?
So, how has that gotten better?
Participant:
Um… okay, um, they’re talking so I’m having trouble hearing.
Interviewer : Oh, no worries.
I asked you, uh, you said that that's gotten better a little bit.
Can you kind of describe how it's gotten better for me?
Participant:
Um, I can see one side of my bed.
Interviewer : Okay, right.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
I can see one side of my bed.
Interviewer : So, there was a time where it was kind of unusable then?
Participant:
Oh my god I would have fallen.
I mean I haven’t, um, [inaudible; ] my feet.
Interviewer : Okay.
So, at some point, it was almost dangerous then, right?
Participant:
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Definitely, definitely.
Interviewer : So, other than your bed being relatively unusable at that point, are there any other parts of your house that you can't really use, or objects that you know don't serve their intended purpose because of the hoarding?
Participant:
It's, it's just, you know, I see something and even though I don't necessarily need it, I want it.
Interviewer : Right?
So, has it kind of impacted the way that you can use certain parts of your house—
Participant:
Oh yeah, yeah.
Definitely.
Interviewer : Or maybe made a room unusable?
Participant:
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Interviewer : Okay, so can you touch on that a little bit for me?
Participant:
Can you wait on here for a minute, I’ll be back in a bit.
I Have this thing I have to do.
Sorry about that.
I’ll be in in a minute.
Participant:
So, just let me uh, finish this please… Okay, unfortunately, repeat that question.
Interviewer : No worries at all.
So, I asked, um, I know you mentioned that your bed was kind of unusable at one point, but are there any other, um, parts of your house, or objects in your house that you can't use, or they aren't being used in the way they were intended to be used because of the hoarding?
Participant:
Um, let me see… No, no. Not, not really, cause uh, my sister cleaned out my utility room.
Interviewer : Right.
Participant:
Yeah, so I can now get in my utility room.
Interviewer : Okay, so how about before she cleaned it out?
What was that like?
