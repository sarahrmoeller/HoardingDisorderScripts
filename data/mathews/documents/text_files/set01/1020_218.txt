Interviewer:
And as you are going through this period of, it sounds like, gradually ramping up acquisition.
Participant 020:
Right.
Interviewer:
Were you having trouble discarding at the same time? Were you accumulating stuff, or did it start with the acquisition and the saving?
Participant 020:
Yeah. I think where it really became clear was that the year before I got sober, I had gone to Washington for a few years, the state. I had to come back. I had to leave a whole bunch of things behind me that ended up getting destroyed. The amount of effort it took for me to move stuff here was just incredible. Then the first few months after that, I got sober, and I had to move 10 times the first year. I was carting all sorts of stuff around, that if one was being practical and saying, "There isn't room for this. I'm having to pay for help for this." I think that I was trying to cart way too much around with me that I couldn't let go of, and that's when I first became really conscious that I couldn't let go, no matter how much trouble it was causing me.
Interviewer:
So that experience of having to move and move and realizing that it would be more practical to discard but that you couldn't, that was when you first-
Participant 020:
Right.
Interviewer:
... identified this is an issue. 
Participant 020:
And I was also using up the goodwill. One of my brothers who helped me move several times, finally, after the fourth or fifth move, said, "I'm not going to do this anymore. I can't do it. I don't want to do it."
Interviewer:
You have to-
Participant 020:
"You need to find some place to settle down," and I said, "Can't." He himself right at that point had not dealt with his own drinking problem, but I was feeling guilty on top of it, because I kept having to ask people for help for some things I didn't think I needed help for or shouldn't need help for.
