Participant:
Right, they don't own— they have things that they own and, and right now it's in storage until they do finally settle.
But they don't own any furniture, they have kept only the things that either had sentimental value or they knew they would be like, certain kitchen appliances, like their Instant Pot or whatever.
They kept those things.
And my oldest daughter is the same way.
She, you know, she goes through on a pretty regular basis and colds the herd.
Just gets rid of stuff that no longer has value to her.
And, um, yeah.
So, I think in that way it has affected them because they don't ever want to get to the point on that.
Interviewer: Right.
Okay, so how about outside of the family?
Has it ever impacted work, other than you feeling like you needed to clean up the space because of working at home?
Any time before quarantine where it's affected work?
Participant:
Um, not that it affected work, no. Because, I mean, I have a desk in my bedroom and a writing table, and I have to work in there but… that affected my home life, it did not affect my work.
[Inaudible; ].
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
[Inaudible.]
Interviewer: Yeah, absolutely
Participant:
[INAUDIBLE].
I should just throw that crap away.
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
[INAUDIBLE].
And then when they’re not looking, toss it.
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
That is hard.
Interviewer: Yeah.
So, um, my last question for, you know, the interview is, if you were to wake up one day and all of the things that you consider cluttered in your household were just gone, and the things that were important were organized, how would you feel?
Would you feel relieved or would you feel, you know, distress about the things being gone?
Participant:
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer: Relieved.
Participant:
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer: Oh good, I’m glad.
Participant:
[INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer: Absolutely.
Sometimes it can be easier if it's, you know, someone else and you're kind of removed from the situation.
Participant:
Yeah.
[Inaudible; ].
…But I would not let somebody come into my house right now.
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
I mean, I don’t know how I would clean.
I would be embarrassed.
Interviewer: So, maybe that would be considered like a goal for you to have.
You know, an organized house to the point that someone else could come in and help you out with that.
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer: Okay.
Alright, perfect.
So that's going to be the end of the interview-like questions.
And to wrap up, I just have some questions for like demographics, and then just a couple of questions so we can make sure we get your payment info correct.
Alright, so, the first part is going to be your gender identity.
Participant:
Female.
Interviewer: Okay.
And that's the same as your sex assigned at birth?
Participant:
Yes.
