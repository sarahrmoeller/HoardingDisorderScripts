Participant 45:
Not an argument, per se, no. And then she was very grateful to me because not this Christmas but the prior Christmas I had my sister and her partner plus the neighbors, couple and then my nephew and my sister's son and we ... she does all the holidays by herself and rightfully so and I managed to do a meal. It wasn't done well but it got done and they were so grateful that I had done it that nobody complained about anything. So if you set a low enough standard people are so impressed (laughs)
Interviewer:
Oh my. Okay. All right. I mean, I'm glad that you were able to enjoy that meal though. 
Participant 45:
Something that everybody else would be scornful about they were just laudatory about. 
Interviewer:
Oh my. 
Participant 45:
If they can get in the front door they're amazed. 
Interviewer:
That's great. Okay. That just leads me to my last section which is distinguishing hoarding disorder. We talked about it a little bit before but what would you say are the most important differences between what's considered normal saving behavior, such as like having a collection of something, and hoarding disorder?
Participant 45:
The big difference is other people do not feel pain when they throw something away. They are disciplined about putting things away. If there isn't room for something then they throw something out. If something new comes in and there's not room then ... or in fact if something new comes in usually they have a rule that something has to go out. They don't let people dump things on them as much. They feel much more comfortable about saying, "No, thank you. I don't want that." They're good at that. They're better at boundaries I would say. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 45:
In general. They practice behaviors that make for a better home environment and typically a lot of my friends, most of my friends don't live alone so they have to keep up standards for the other person too. 
Interviewer:
So living with someone is a big way to, I guess stop that behavior. 
Participant 45:
Yeah, I think so. 
Interviewer:
Okay. 
Participant 45:
And I think, in general, opposites attract in that sense. There's one person that keeps the one that might collect stuff, it keeps a lid on it.
