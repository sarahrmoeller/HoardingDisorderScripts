Interviewer:
It seems like you're fairly open, and you're comfortable with the fact that this hoarding disorder is something that you experience, but you seem to be almost proud in a way that it doesn't drastically affect your life.
But it is something that bothers you on an individual level.
Participant 29:
Yeah, that's pretty true.
Yes.
But yeah, it definitely bothers me and I still hoping to overcome this, in this lifetime.
I don't know how much time I have left to work on it.
But I would love, I've said that to myself so many times.
I would feel so proud if I could overcome this.
I mean I give stuff to charity all the time.
I take stuff to the INAUDIBLE thrift store, I do get rid of stuff.
But, I have so much stuff that it just doesn't make enough of a dent.
So I'm trying to get rid of it even more.
And that's something I keep in the garage.
In the garage I have ...
Right now, I actually have five boxes that I put items in when I come across them, and I think, "Okay, this can go."
So I really want to overcome this in this lifetime.
I don't want anyone to have to clean up after me when I'm gone.
Can you hold on ...
Wait, I can take the phone with me.
My dog, I think she needs to go outside.
She never gets up from her pillow while I'm on the phone.
So I think she might need to go potty, but it's raining.
Are we coming near the end?
Interviewer:
Yes.
Participant 29:
Or is there still quite a bit to go?
Interviewer:
There's a fair amount left to go, but we can try to go a little bit more quickly through it.
Participant 29:
I'm not trying to hurry you, because I know I'm doing most of the talking.
I'm just trying to figure out whether I need to ...
Maybe I'll just walk outside with my phone and see if she can go potty, okay?
Interviewer:
That's okay.
Participant 29:
You can keep talking, I'm walking with my phone.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 29:
You can let me know if the reception gets poor.
Interviewer:
Will do.
I wanted to ask, so it seems that at times the behavior of hoarding or of accumulation, it upsets you.
Has there ever been a time in your life when the hoarding got in the way of something that you really wanted?
Participant 29:
... At the time when I told you that I was really depressed and couldn't deal with things.
Then I let the main part of my house get messy at times, and I didn't want anyone to come in.
Is that the sort of thing you mean?
