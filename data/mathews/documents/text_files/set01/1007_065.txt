Interviewer:
Okay. Now, we're just going to talk a little bit about distinguishing typical hoarding behavior from what would be considered normal behavior? So, what would you consider the most important difference between what is considered normal, sane behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder? 
Participant 007:
Organization and the ability to dis-attach. Ability to, maybe, accept that it's not really perfect and it will never be perfect. To make it the best you can. 
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Participant 007:
Yeah, just keeping on top of things every day. 
Interviewer:
Okay. What would you say hoarding disorder looks like and how is that same or different from your behavior?
Participant 007:
You just can't get rid of stuff. It's about the same. You bring stuff in and then, you buy a pair of socks and you don't get rid of a pair of socks. You just have a lot of pair of socks. I think it's an inability to balance the intake with the outflow, perhaps. 
Interviewer:
Okay, that's a really good way of putting it. No one's ever said that. Where would you say you get most of your information about hoarding disorder from? Do you read about it or do you watch news? 
Participant 007:
No. No, no, no. I live it, so why would I need those things? Why would I need to read about it? I never read anything that helps me. I do see the books and the KonMari Method, and the problem with that is everything feels wonderful for me, so I can't risk [crosstalk 00:43:44].
Interviewer:
When did you first learn of this term or this disorder? 
Participant 007:
I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea. I couldn't tell you. I know that there was ... I used to work for television [listing 00:44:08], and what is that, Hoarders, or something that's around that I can't bring myself to watch. A&E, I think? 
Interviewer:
Yeah, it is Hoarders. 
Participant 007:
Okay, that's Hoarders. Yeah, and I think that's probably where we adapted to the term. 
Interviewer:
Okay. All right. This last section is what we call little vignettes. Basically, they're little scenarios and then at the end ... I'm going to read you a little paragraph and then, at the end, you're just going to say if you think this person has hoarding disorder or if it's more being cluttered, and then, if they should try to change their behavior and if you think they need treatment from a psychiatrist, and if their behavior is similar or different to your own. Then I can go over the questions again after I read them. 
Participant 007:
Okay.
