Interviewer:
Okay. All right. So first question is how has COVID-19 impacted your life? What specific behaviors has changed?
Participant 1:
Going into work. I can't go in and see other people. When I go out and run, if I'm not wearing a mask, people start cowering and yelling at me. It's ridiculous. I'm out on a trail six feet away from somebody. They're ... But you know, in all fairness, it hasn't changed my life that much because once I was working from home quite a bit before and I did lose my job last January, and partly due to COVID because they closed our San Francisco office because the company was having money problems anyway, but they closed the San Francisco office and everybody is working remotely for good, which I think is really bad. It's really bad. I think it's alienating people and people are having problems-
Interviewer:
I agree.
Participant 1:
... and eating more than normal. When I'm up by my house where I can cook, and that's not good. I've had some health problems because I don't know why. I'm having some right now. I just got back from the doctor. So it's caused health problems. And we have had horrible fires in the Bay Area. And so the smoke travel here has been horrible for the last couple weeks.
Interviewer:
Absolutely.
Participant 1:
This is like the year from hell.
Interviewer:
I know.
Participant 1:
The year from hell.
Interviewer:
It's horrible.
Participant 1:
I know.
Interviewer:
Absolutely horrible.
Participant 1:
I know.
Interviewer:
Okay. So how in your opinion has COVID-19 affected your acquiring habits, including buying things?
Participant 1:
Well, losing a job affects you buying things. You just cut way back.
Interviewer:
Exactly. Okay.
Participant 1:
I actually just bought a couple things for myself. I'm collecting unemployment. And I got a severance and so I'm okay right now. But I'm certainly not out buying big ticket items.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Has it affected your difficulties with throwing things away?
Participant 1:
No.
Interviewer:
No? Okay. Perfect.
Participant 1:
No. Mm-hmm (negative).
Interviewer:
How has COVID-19 affected your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items?
Participant 1:
It hasn't.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 1:
I mean, it doesn't affect it one way or the other.
Interviewer:
All right. Okay.
Participant 1:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Let's see. Oh, how have you been coping since COVID-19 started?
Participant 1:
I was fine until I left my job. But I'm at the point where I'm almost ready to retire and I'm in the final interviews for a new job. I don't know what'll happen but I'm kind of just taking it, I don't know ... I'm not getting really upset about it. I'm continuing to live my life. And depending on where you're located, different areas are more ... like the Bay Area is much more rigid about their COVID-
Interviewer:
Measures? Yeah.
