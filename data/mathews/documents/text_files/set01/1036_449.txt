Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So for her it's a problem because the stuff is making it difficult for her to get into the house.
Participant 036:
To get around. You put your first kind of- used to have all my closets. She had a place to keep boxes like a gag. At first the house was okay.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So the first person doesn't have this problem, because all his boxes are put away and out of the way. But, the second person has a problem they're all out and it's difficult to move around in the house and it's a safety issue. Does that sound right?
Participant 036:
That's right. That's how I think of it, yes ma'am.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And what about you? Where do you think you fall between these people in terms of your problems?
Participant 036:
My problem I would say, in between or I'd say probably closer to the fellow who has the closet full of box. I'd say maybe halfway. I used to block way in my room, if there's just space I can lay down on do some poetry signs. For my little walk around the neighborhood. So id say I've got a problem but it's under control right now.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So, you're kind of more between them but maybe even closer to the first person than the second person right now?
Participant 036:
Yes ma'am. To make a long story short I pretty much quit getting stuff from Amazon and the likes because there literally boxes here that we hardly ever use.
Interviewer:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Definitely. So what about this person? We did John and Jane we'll do...lets se, what a good name? Peter. " Peter has a lot of tools in his house that he keeps in case he needs to use them, tools occupy  most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bath tub, sometimes it's difficult for peter to find his car keys and his wallet, so he'll spend so or 20 minuets looking fr them until he eventually finds them. When this happens he is sometimes late in getting to where he needs to be". Do you think that this is a person who has hoarding problems?
