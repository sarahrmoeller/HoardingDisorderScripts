Interviewer: Okay. Right, so, let's talk a little bit now about the space that you're living in. I know you said you're staying with your mother, but has that been a long-term arrangement or did you have a house of your own previously?
Participant:
No, I have a house of my own. My mother ended up having major surgery, so she was in the hospital and from there went to rehab. And, when I brought her home— she has dementia— so, uh, before she was able to go by herself, but with the anesthesia when you have dementia, it makes the dementia worse. So, at this point, she is not able to stay by herself, and, uh… While she was in rehab, I was walking down to her house anyway. So, I'm just kind of waiting for her to kind of get back to where she can stay alone again.
Interviewer: Right.
Participant:
I’m hoping, you know…
Interviewer: Mhmm. So, in the house that you lived in previously, what are the rooms like? Was there any areas of the house that were cluttered in particular?
Participant:
Most. Uh… there’s a den downstairs. It’s pretty horrible. Uh, the garage is horrible. Uh, we had to get an out-building— well two out-buildings— and they’re packed.
Interviewer:
So, what do you mean by horrible?
Participant:
There's so much stuff, uh… that I need to figure out. Uh, things on top of boxes, on top of… Just lots and lots of stuff.
Interviewer: Mhmm. So, kind of stacked up in like piles, or are they more organized?
Participant:
Stacked up in piles.
Interviewer: Gotcha. So, does it ever impede like the floor area, or maybe prevent you from using anything the way it's supposed to be used?
Participant:
Yes.
Interviewer: Okay. Can you touch on that a little bit?
Participant:
Well, before the area was packed up with boxes and things everywhere, um… my husband had wanted a pool table. But, there’s no room for a pool table because of all these boxes. Because of all this stuff!
Interviewer: Right. So, are any rooms worse than others? I know you said the garage and the den were particularly bad, but are those, would you say, the most severely ported rooms in the house?
Participant:
Well, I also have the office in my house, and it’s bad too.
Interviewer: Gotcha. So, what kinds of things are, you know, part of these piles that you have hoarded? Are there like papers, or maybe like knickknacks? Anything in particular, or just kind of like everything?
