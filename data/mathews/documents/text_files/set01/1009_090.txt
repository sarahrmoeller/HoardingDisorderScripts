Interviewee:
It is.
But it's funny because I think it's the same thing, my mother... well, for her it was being a child of scarcity and then being married to my father and the same thing with moving every year or two for the first third of her marriage, and so then once she got settled in a place same kind of thing.
It's like, "I'm here.
I don't want to leave."
That's why he couldn't get her to move into an independent place.
She wouldn't leave the home.
Interviewer:
So, between your mom, your father, and you, did it ever cause a lot of problems?
Did you guys ever get in any fights over keeping things?
Interviewee:
I don't know of any fights.
There certainly weren't any fights with me because when I was a kid you just did what you were told and you just did it, and my mother I think, who knows in the privacy of my mom and dad whether there were fights about it, but I do know when we were going through there was a heck of a lot of stuff she had, so.
I think he just put up with it.
But you know, the same kind of thing, their public rooms were all beautiful.
Their living room, all of that was beautiful and well kept and everything and the stuff she kept was confined to her desk, her file cabinets, her closet, that kind of thing.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, your clutter was organized and hidden so the rooms everyone needed were accessible?
Interviewee:
Right.
Right.
You could walk into their house and it was very pristine and beautifully decorated and all of that.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So, you mentioned you have sisters, did you ever get in fights with them about sharing things or having too much, or your whole time when you were living under your parent's roof it was never a problem because your dad was very minimal?
Interviewee:
Well, my sister a year younger than me, the two of us shared a room for years and we were always really rigid about this half of the room is yours, this half of mine.
Keep you and your stuff on your side.
So, it wasn't a fight over how much stuff there was, it was just making sure that you adhered to your half of the room.
Interviewer:
I also have a younger sister that I shared a room with and that was very much how we did it.
It was like a line down the middle, basically.
Interviewee:
Yeah.
And my sister used to have nightmares and she'd tried to get in bed with me and I'm like, "You can't do that.
You have to go to your side."
Interviewer:
Yes, that's very much how it was.
Interviewee:
Excuse me.
Interviewer:
Oh, your fine.
So, you mentioned you also have a son, do you just have the one son?
Interviewee:
Yes.
