Participant:
So I was gonna say um just he decreases, my opportunity for hoarding.
Interviewer:

My opportunity. Yeah
Interviewer:
And have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Participant:
Yes, yes I do. I have a like a trick that I do, which is To get rid of five things. So, I try to on the weekends or on other days when there's like more time. I work sometimes. I will challenge myself to get rid of five things.
Interviewer:
That's awesome. Okay. And have you ever gone to a professional for help.
Participant:
No.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, why have you never gone to a professional for help?
Participant:
Well, I guess, because I guess I don't feel that much of a problem. Doesn't impact me financially because my focus is on free and cheap things. And um, it doesn’t keep me up at night. It doesn’t cause me stress.
Interviewer- Ok sounds good. So, you’ve Mentioned that your partner keeps your behavior in check. But how do your other friends and family feel about your behavior?
Participant:
I think that. Well, I, my friends, my family. I don't think they have any concerns because they’re worse. But I would say that…My friends, um, its just kind of embarrassing. UNCLEAR  But like, you know, somebody has a bag of clothes or something that they want to take to good will in the garage they’ve got like a pile of things that’s meant to go to charity or something like that. And so, sometimes people say “Oh here I’ve got a pile of clothes, see if there’s anything in here that you like.” So, I'm always very Eager to look through people things. And so I think that that when if that if that I’m over like a couple of times and I have that opportunity to do that every time I'm there and I feel that the person feels that maybe like kind of moochy or grabby about things and So, or that I'm only going over there to look for their free things. I don't think that that's the case. But I feel like they’re looking at me like, “oh, what does she want now?”
Interviewer:
Okay. Like you just have you just have like a feeling like an intuition. But there's never been like any open conflict?

No, no, no, no, but I feel like a person is thinking
Interviewer:
like you're being judged.
Participant:
Yeah. Yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay. Um, so like relating to that. Have you ever had conflicts with people close to you, or maybe landlords about your behavior?
