Participant:
Oh yeah, yeah. You know, you think this person might come into your house and you think, god I would have to get rid of a bunch of stuff for him to come in and it’s embarrassing to me. And, I wouldn’t want him to open up my closet doors, my pantry, anything.
Interviewer (27:29): Mhmm. So, what about your sister? Does she ever have people over?
Participant:
Um, well, you know, with all this stuff going on, the only person that has been over in, in two months is just my niece and mother. But, that’s the two that are hoarders also.
Interviewer (27:44): Okay, so it's not a problem for them?
Participant:
It’s not a problem, no.
Interviewer (27:47): Right.
Participant:
Yeah, not really for them, no. Now, when I go to my niece’s house and my, uh, her mother's house, it is almost a panic to me if I go in there.
Interviewer (27:58): Really?
Participant 054 (28:00) 
Yeah, because the stuff they have in theirs’s is ten times worse than what I have in mine.
Interviewer (28:07): Okay, in what way?
Participant:
Um, she has a little— my niece, my niece has a breakfast nook. And, uh, there’s, there’s supposed to be a table in there, but she has, she has, uh, four [inaudible; (28:20)] of stuff she’s got packed in there. Her bills are in there, and I don't know how she even looks at it or what she’s got to pay. Uh, she's got tons of things in her dining room. Her little, uh, [inaudible; (28:30)] was supposed to be like an office where the kids could do their schoolwork. You can't even see in that room.
Interviewer (28:37): Because there's so much stuff like, packed up?
Participant:
Oh, yeah, yeah. She has one of those big soaker tubs in her bathroom in her bedroom. And it’s filled to the top with stuff.
Interviewer (28:48): Wow. Like what kinds of stuff?
Participant:
It's everything. It’s backpacks, um, sometimes it’s clothes… it could be her dresser from her bedroom. I don’t even know how she picks out her choice.
Interviewer (29:01): Right. So, just—
Participant:
But, this is for me. You go ahead and I’ll let you— [Talking to someone else not on the phone] Wait just a minute, let me finish this. I’ll talk to you afterwards because I’m talking to [inaudible]. No, no, no. It's about me. It's about me. Okay. I will come on a minute, just go ahead and order what you want. Okay… Um, how much more time do we have to do this?
Interviewer (29:31): Um, usually it's a sixty-minute interview.
Participant:
Oh, okay.
Interviewer (29:37): If that's all right with you.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer (29:39): I mean, it might be like a little bit less, maybe like fifty minutes.
Participant:
Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer (29:44): Okay.
Participant:
Because my sister’s spazzing on me.
Interviewer (29:47): No worries. Yeah, I'll try and move quickly. No worries at all.
