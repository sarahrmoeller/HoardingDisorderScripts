Interviewer:
I would like to ask you about another patient, so let's imagine that this is Sarah.
So Sarah has several antiques that she keeps because she likes them and she knows that they're valuable.
She goes out once a week and buys more antiques, she's worried that she might get rid of an antique item that's worth a lot of money.
Antiques occupy every room, before entering the bathroom Sarah must remove several antique items.
Often it's difficult for her to find her car keys and wallet and so she'll spend up to 30 minutes looking for them.
She's almost always late in getting where she needs to go and sometimes she doesn't show up at all.
So do you think that this is a person with hoarding disorder?
Interviewee6:
I think so.
Interviewer:
And why, what makes the difference?
Interviewee6:
Because she feels the need to accumulate antiques whether or not she needs them, it sounds like she doesn't have room for them and it sounds like she has more than she can handle so it's cluttering her life and her mind.
Interviewer:
So it doesn't matter to you in this case that one person is saving boxes and the other person is saving valuable antiques?
Interviewee6:
Not really.
Interviewer:
And how come?
It sounds like the difference is that-
Interviewee6:
I think it's effecting them the same way.
Interviewer:
So the similarity is the effect on their life?
Interviewee6:
I think so, yeah.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So now I'm going to ask you a couple more questions about your life and the idea here is to understand the impact of the recent events with COVID on people's lives and their ability to clutter or declutter their homes.
So thinking specifically about the last couple of months, which has effected everybody, do you feel like it has effected your life at all in terms of clutter to have had this experience with COVID-19?
Interviewee6:
Yes.
Interviewer:
In which way?
Interviewee6:
I've gotten rid of some of the clutter, because I'm spending more time at home and I have more time to deal with it.
Interviewer:
So you've actually been able to de-clutter because you have the time to organize?
Interviewee6:
Right, and then my kids came back home for about four months, and so I had the incentive to keeps things neat.
Interviewer:
So the presence of your children in your home has made you need to keep your home more organized.
Interviewee6:
Mm-hmm .
Interviewer:
Has it effected your acquiring of items or of news or magazines or papers, has it impacted that at all, have you been acquiring more or fewer new things?
Interviewee6:
Well we canceled our newspaper delivery, so that was a big step.
Interviewer:
Because of COVID?
Interviewee6:
Because of COVID?
Not really.
Interviewer:
You canceled it because you just didn't want the paper anymore?
Interviewee6:
Right.
