Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. I have a few questions for you now about how hoarding disorder differs from what's typically normal saving behavior.
Do you think there's any difference between normal collecting items and hoarding?
Interviewee:
You know, I don't know what the correct answer is.
Interviewer:
There's no correct answer.
Interviewee:
I would think yeah there would be a difference.
Collecting things, like my dad, he collects knives and coins and things, but he's not a hoarder.
His house, he and his wife, there house is very orderly.
I would say yes there is a difference between hoarding and being a collector.
Interviewer:
It seems to be a level of organization might be what distinguishes it.
Interviewee:
That and, I mean with me it's not anything in particular, I just like to enjoy life and I like to have pretty things.
I mean granted I have a lot of clothes and jewelry, but I like pretty things for my house too.
It's not just any one thing.
When you're a collector you're more focused on acquiring certain things, not everything in general.
Interviewer:
Yeah, that's very clear.
Interviewee:
I'm sorry I have an allergy CROSSTALK
Interviewer:
Are you okay?
Interviewee:
Mm-hmm AFFIRMATIVE.
Interviewer:
Where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Is it mainly from TV, online?
Interviewee:
Yeah it's mostly, I've seen that show about hoarders and just random things online.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Now I have a few questions for you more about how this quarantine and working from home has impacted your life.
Have you seen any changes in your acquiring during this time?
Interviewee:
Oh yeah.
I mean we don't get out as much, so definitely not acquiring.
Although we do shop online.
Yeah, I think it has slowed down.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Has there been any renewed energy or interest in cleaning out and donating or discarding items?
Interviewee:
Yes, but that comes in waves, it's not an everyday thing.
It's like, "Oh well I'm here, what's the rush," you know?
I do think about it.
You would have thought, I've been home since the middle of March, you would have thought I could have gone through that bedroom but part of the problem is I don't know what I'm going to do with that stuff, so going through it doesn't make it go away.
Interviewer:
Yeah.
Interviewee:
Yeah, so I have to figure out what I'm going to do with it, but I did go through some of it from time to time, and I did get rid of stuff.
I mean I have a box now of stuff I'm going to donate, some clothes and shoes and some household items that I just know I'm not going to keep.
It's kind of an ongoing thing.
Interviewer:
Has it gotten easier to think about getting rid of items, or to kind of think, "Oh yeah I may not need that," or to-
