On the weekends when I was home, it's like, I don't want to do anything, I'm going to just decompress, et cetera, et cetera, and move on.
That was a big change.
That, I think, is when the clutter really started building.
Interviewer:
It was really after you got back.
Interviewee:
My guest bedroom turned into my packing, unpacking triage room.
It just really started getting out of control then.
From 2005 to 2016, is when it all built up.
Then, when I got home, I still didn't do anything.
Interviewer:
Have you been impacted financially by COVID?
It sounds like you were retired before COVID, has this had any financial impact-
Interviewee:
Yeah, I was retired before COVID.
No, I've got a decent income, I've got enough to pay the bills.
I don't have ... I didn't save enough early on to take advantage of compounding my money.
My grand plans for retiring and cruising and traveling the world, I don't have the money for that.
Plus, now with the granddaughter, extra money goes to enrichment things for her, because my son and daughter-in-law are not ...
Their income is not wonderful.
Interviewer:
Yeah, exactly.
Interviewee:
I've kind of come to grips with it, and have figured out what I can do, what I can't do, and try and make it really a high-value reward when I do travel somewhere.
That's my life.
Interviewer:
How have you been coping since COVID, especially since you stopped working so much?
What sorts of things have you been doing to help yourself, to feel better during this time?
Interviewee:
Oh, play computer games, watch lots of TV.
Before the temperature hits 90, which is by  a.m., go out and play with the dogs in the yard.
Do a little gardening, et cetera, et cetera.
Do water walking at the pool.
Interviewer:
That's great.
Interviewee:
When it's open.
That's about it.
I'm aware that I'm in a high-risk group because of my age, obesity, cancer survivor, that sort of thing.
Although, I don't think I'm immunosuppressive, I'm just not on an aromatase inhibitor now.
Never had to do chemo.
Cancer-lite, it was really nice.
Interviewer:
If you're going to get cancer, that is a good, is it good to get cancer-lite.
Interviewee:
Yeah, it was intraductal carcinoma, but on diagnosis with the core biopsies, it's staged out as a zero.
Then after surgery, it was a one.
Interviewer:
That's great, I'm so happy it was caught.
Interviewee:
I just opted, let's have bilateral mastectomies, and I know you're not going to sling a flap, I'm too old to deal with all that.
We did implants, and that was it.
No radiation, no chemo.
That's why I call it lite.
Interviewer:
I'm so glad that they caught it so early, that's wonderful.
