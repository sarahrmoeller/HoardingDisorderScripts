Interviewer:
Right.
So it's not simply a matter of you keeping things, it's a matter of, once you're not actively using them, they just stay wherever you last used them.
Participant 019:
Right, and I forget where I put that, because I'm moving onto something else.
Interviewer:
You seem very oriented towards tasks and their completion, and you get a lot of satisfaction out of that, and then once it's not useful to you in the moment anymore, it completely falls off your radar and it's not interesting to you.
Participant 019:
And don't think about completing it to the point where I can find it next time I need it.
It's almost like used and then gone the next thing.
Interviewer:
It also seems like that's a component of what you were just talking about, which is this sense of potential projects, or it almost sounds like ambition of, "One day I'll be able to do this thing, and I'm just going to save these things until I am able to get around to whatever this project is."
So for you, discarding is also about the process of giving up those sorts of ambitions of one day completing those projects.
Participant 019:
That's true, but I think the point I was trying to make, Interviewer, was that even if something I know is necessary, still part of my active project possibilities, I don't honor the fact that I have disorganized something when using it.
It needs to be then reestablished for the next time.
Interviewer:
So again, I'm going to try to repeat that back to you, because I want to understand.
So it sounds like what you're saying is you're so oriented towards usefulness, but sometimes you undermine objects' usefulness by not organizing them and keeping them in a way that will make them optimally useful for you.
Participant 019:
In the future, yeah.
It's almost a sense of, I've completed what I was trying to get done, but I don't realize that's not the end of the project.
The end of the project is using, thinking about the tools, thinking of how I've broken up my organization to get this project done, it needs to be then reestablished so that it can be available in the future.
Interviewer:
That part of the process is just really difficult for you to notice.
Participant 019:
Maybe because I'm prone to take on too many things.
