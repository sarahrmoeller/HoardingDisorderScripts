Interviewer:
Yeah. Have you kept in contact with family and friends during this time? How often do you interact with them usually? Either physically or virtually.
Interviewee:
I have a son in New York that we talk to not nearly often enough but probably once a week. We hear from him maybe less now but once every two weeks. I have siblings that I speak to all the time. For a while, with extended family, all over the east coast we used to do a Zoom family meeting every couple of weeks, which is great. That kind of stopped. Yeah. I'm keeping ... The family stays in close contact.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Did you feel socially isolated or lonely prior to COVID? Have you felt more lonely during COVID?
Interviewee:
Definitely more lonely during COVID because I am a fairly social person and I miss getting together with people. I can't believe it's been however many months and I haven't seen the people that I work with every single day. It's just weird to me. There's this whole group of people that you spend so much time with every day and every week and then it just stops. It's so odd.
Interviewer:
Yeah. Definitely. Have you experienced conflict during COVID or less or more conflict during COVID?
Interviewee:
I don't think there's more or less. You know, I guess frustration over politics makes my life more conflicted. You know, I did a lot of protesting. No, I don't ... I think it's about the same.
Interviewer:
Okay. Yeah. That's actually the last part of our Interviewer. Thank you for completing this Interviewer with me. Before we go, I would like to get some demographic and payment information so we can send you that $30 gift card.

Interviewee:
I'm part of ... You guys got my name from the other study that I'm doing with the university and so I have a credit card that money gets dumped into whenever I fill out a questionnaire or something. Is that different?
