Interviewer:
I’ve never heard of those, but that sounds great. So how severe would you say that this behavior is now compared to when you were a kid?
Interviewee:
I think it’s worse now because I’m collecting more and buying more than I could have when I was a kid.  Interviewer:
What kind of items do you collect?
Interviewee:
Well lately I’ve been buying some books, and then like I said, some tech equipment. Let’s see… Well obviously I’ve been buying a lot of stuff on Amazon for the house. We’ve been collecting toilet paper.
Interviewer:
Right, the COVID crisis definitely increases my online shopping, for sure.
Interviewee:
Oh for sure, and hoarding too!
Interviewer:
Do you think that your issues with clutter have increased because of the stay at home order or has it been the same?
Interviewee:
Yeah, I think so a little bit, just because I have more time and freedom to, you know, buy things. Yeah, and then just being home more… more places to not clean up.  Interviewer:
So have you ever sought to change this behavior?
Interviewee:
I keep making little attempts, especially when my husband or child gets upset with me and says, “Just do one thing a day,” and I start doing that for maybe a day or two, and then I don’t.  Interviewer:
Have you ever gone to a professional to help with this behavior?
Interviewee:
No.
Interviewer1: Okay, so you mentioned that sometimes your family members get a little bit upset. What are some of the things that they want you to do other than cleaning up persay? Do they get upset when you buy new things or….
Interviewee:
Oh yeah, husband especially gets upset, but then mostly it’s been stuff for the house, so he can’t get upset with this!
Interviewer:
Have you ever had conflicts with other people close to you that aren’t family members, like landlords or other people?
Interviewee:
Oh no, thank God. No, that hasn’t been a problem. It’s been family because most of it is, well, in the home is cluttered.
Interviewer:
Right. So speaking of your home, the next section of questions I have is about your space and your living area, and how you see your home. Can you describe where you live now?
Interviewee:
Well I live in a single family home. I live with my husband and one of my adult daughters. It’s in a suburb and… oh go ahead..
Interviewer:
No, no, no, I was just going to ask, what is the space like?
Interviewee:
It’s a small home. It’s got about 900 square feet, and technically there are three bedrooms. They’re very small and, you know, there’s a lot of stuff in this house, and some of it is is co-collected by my husband or there’s other things, and I’m not responsible for that room right now, although some of it is my stuff.
