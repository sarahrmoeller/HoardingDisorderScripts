Interviewer:
Okay. Great.
Okay, so now we're going to transition into the second part.
I'm just going to ask you some questions.
You don't have to do the listing anymore.
It's just going to be kind of conversational.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Yeah, so can you please describe your hoarding specifically?
How long has this been going on for you?
Interviewee:
I would say really high school and college.
I have a really hard time getting rid of stuff.
Interviewer:
High school and college.
Okay.
And how old are you now, if you don't mind me asking?
Interviewee:
46. Interviewer:
Okay, so this has gone on for awhile, right?
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
How severe is this now for you?
Has it increased steadily as you've gotten older?
Interviewee:
No, if anything it's probably a little better, but pretty mild I would say.
So, like on a scale of one to 10, it's probably a three.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
It's not like the house is overrun with stuff or anything like that.
It's just very hard for me to get rid of stuff.
Interviewer:
Right.
Is there something that sparked it, maybe your initial acquiring of items in college and high school?
Interviewee:
No. Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
I can't think of anything.
Interviewer:
Just started kind of collecting more and more things, or you were always kind of a collector?
Interviewee:
Always kind of a collector.
I guess the way that I manage it is I just don't get much stuff, cause it is so hard to get rid of it once I have it.
Interviewer:
And why is it tough to get rid of it for you?
Interviewee:
Some of the stuff that's hardest to get rid of is if it was given to me by somebody else.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
There's some sense that I shouldn't just throw it away because of that, or there will be some projects that I've never finish that it's very difficult to get rid of because I feel guilty that I never finished it.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Interviewee:
And I probably never will.
Yeah.
Interviewer:
It seems like you have some insight, though.
I mean, knowing that you have projects that you'll never finish, or knowing.
You know?
Interviewee:
Yeah.
I was thinking about it, even this week, I threw out a box of stuff that was related to a research project that I had done when I was an undergrad.
I think the trash just came through today, but I threw it out on Monday.
Every day I was thinking about it sitting in the trash, feeling bad about throwing it out, never finished the project, and I've been carrying it around for probably almost 25 years now.
