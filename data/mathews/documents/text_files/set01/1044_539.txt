Interviewer:
Yeah, so you think that you would like to change your behavior because it would make your space more comfortable, less dangerous and you'd feel better ultimately.
Interviewee44:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And I know that you mentioned before that you'd probably be angry if something were to happen to your jewelry.
What about any of your other items?
Would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of them?
Interviewee44:
I would be having to make decisions about things.
There's so much stuff to make decisions about.
In my bedroom, I know I've bought all these different vitamins and things like that when they were on sale and they're in there someplace.
But I can't find it.
Interviewer:
Right, so it's just more overwhelming than anything, that decision making?
Interviewee44:
The decision making about tossing isn't about tossing things.
Interviewer:
Okay, so it's more so about whether to not to throw out things away that's more distressing.
Interviewee44:
Yes.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Well, that concludes the discussion portion of this interview.
The last thing that I'm going to ask is a couple of demographic questions.
And, for some reason, if you don't want to answer any of the questions that's totally fine.
