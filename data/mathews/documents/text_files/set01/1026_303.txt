Participant 26:
I don't think so, I didn't hear that there was a problem.
Interviewer:
So it's just a thing that he does that doesn't really in the way of his life?
Participant 26:
I think so.
Interviewer:
Do you feel like this person's behavior is similar to yours or different from yours?
Participant 26:
Somewhat similar.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Now I'm going to read you another vignette about another person, so let's call this person Jill.
Jill has several boxes that she keeps in case she needs to store something or decides to move.
When items are delivered to Jill's house she keeps the container the item came, she's worried that she might get rid of a box that she'll need later, and stacks of boxes occupy every one of her rooms.
Before entering her room, she must removes several stacks of boxes.
Her house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for her to walk in her house.
Often it's difficult for Jill to find her car keys and wallet and she'll spend about 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until she eventually finds them.
She's almost always late in getting to where she needs because she has so much trouble finding her keys.
Do you feel like this is a person with hoarding disorder?
Participant 26:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And what makes the difference for you?
Participant 26:
The fact that every room has boxes, that she has to move things out of the way when she enters the room and that she has trouble on a regular basis finding things.
Interviewer:
So all of those things are signs that this is more of a problem?
Participant 26:
Right, it's negatively impacting her life.
Interviewer:
So should she try to change her behavior?
Participant 26:
Yes.
Interviewer:
And what do you think she should do to try to change her behavior?
Participant 26:
She probably should be in therapy.
Interviewer:
Okay, so maybe this is a person who needs help from a psychiatrist or a psychologist to deal with this problem?
Participant 26:
I would say so.
Interviewer:
And do you feel like this person's behavior is similar to or different from your behavior?
Participant 26:
Different.
Interviewer:
And what's the difference?
Participant 26:
The difference is that I don't have an excess of items in every room, I don't need to move things around in order to get around, and it's not really impacting my life.
I think I'm pretty efficient in what I do, so the clutter's not really getting in the way except that it's an eyesore.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Okay so for the final vignette I'd like to read you, and then we'll get back to talking, we'll get the last section of the interview.
Participant 26:
Yeah.
