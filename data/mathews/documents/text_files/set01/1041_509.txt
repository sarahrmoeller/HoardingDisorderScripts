Interviewer:
Okay. I know you mentioned it upsets your mom.
Does it upset anyone else in your family?
Participant 041:
No, it doesn't because it's just my mom, my brother, and I. My brother, he has his own room, and all of my stuff is contained to my room, and then the garage but the garage was organized so it's like my stuff is on one side and my mom's stuff is on the other side, so there's no overlap.
Interviewer:
Okay.
So I know you mentioned that one of your exes had a hoarding problem.
Did he ever find your clutter problems were an issue in your relationship, or was it mainly you were just having a problem with his problem?
Participant 041:
I was having a problem with his problem because his problems became my CROSSTALK.
In the short period of time, that was a short relationship, but that was a lot.
Nice guy, but we were just on different wavelengths.
He was very complacent and had a defeated sense of self.
He said that I was too serious.
His priorities were not the best, like he'd rather invest money on video games and play INAUDIBLE than spending time with his girlfriend.
So his priorities aren't going towards getting a car, because I've always had a car.
He didn't plan for any of that.
I knew I never should've dated someone without a car.
Like I said I wouldn't date someone without a car in Florida, so why would I date someone without a car in a different state?
Yeah, it was just always an argument like with, "Okay, why don't you let me help you clean up this?", or, "Why don't you do this this way?" We weren't good for one another.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Do you think his behavior affected you in either a positive or negative way at all?
Participant 041:
A negative way.
You heard how I was just telling you, like just dealing with him, it triggered a need to be, I'm not blaming everything on him because of course I have to take responsibility, but it definitely was negative because the relationship that we had was not a positive situation.
He really wasn't able to offer any support with depression or with clutter besides just words.
It wasn't like he was coming to see me.
Interviewer:
Okay.
Participant 041:
Yeah.
So no, it was negative-
Interviewer:
Okay.
No, I just wasn't sure if when you mentioned that you had gone to therapy if that was the same boyfriend or if it was a different one.
I-
Participant 041:
No, it was the same.
No, it was the same.
Interviewer:
Okay, okay.
Sorry.
Participant 041:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
I should've clarified that.
