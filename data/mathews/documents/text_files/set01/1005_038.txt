Participant 005:
Yes. Yeah. It is. It's similar to the previous one. It was something particular that is not just, for instance, your mail becomes [INAUDIBLE]. It's scattered around the house. This is something he is saving for possible use in the future and that seems more of the mentality of a hoarder.
Interviewer:
Okay. This last scenario I'm going to go ahead and read this one. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room and before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.
Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.
Again, in this scenario, do you believe this is more of a clutter problem or something more serious?
Participant 005:
I would say it's more than just clutter again because it's acquiring things that don't necessarily have a purpose in the house and just acquiring so many of them that it's interfering with his daily life. I would say it's more on the hoarding side.
Interviewer:
For this scenario, do you believe this behavior is similar or different to your own behavior?
Participant 005:
There are some similarities, not at that extreme, and I don't ... There isn't one particular thing that I go out and acquire for a collection of, like, antiques. I will purchase things that are kind of '50s era, even if I don't have a place for display or I have too many things to display. Sometimes something gets into my mindset that, "Oh, this would look fabulous in my house" but there really isn't ... I don't need anything more like that. There are some similarities.
Interviewer:
Okay. Thank you. That was the third part of the Interviewer. This last part of the Interviewer is actually about COVID and its impacts. Once again, I will be asking you some questions and if you need any clarification or feel uncomfortable answering a question, just let me know.
Participant 005:
Okay.
Interviewer:
Okay. How has COVID impacted your life? What specific behaviors have changed for you?
Participant 005:
To some extent, I am purging but not enough but I'm starting. That's a good thing. Especially since I am in my house so much that I kind of see it. Also, the fact that I occupy my office and I have so many things going on in my office at once, to some extent, it's messier than it was pre-COVID. It's had a multiple impact on me in different ways.
