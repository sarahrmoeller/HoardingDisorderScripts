Interviewer:
What is the space like? Are there any, you mentioned that you odn’t think it’s cluttered?
Participant:
Yeah, yeah, I wouldn’t say it’s cluttered much, I mean, I think like every house it tends to get in disarray I guess with unfolded clothes and stuff like that. But as far as clutter goes, you know I mean I guess there are things on my bathroom counter and things on my dresser and stuff like that, that need to be put away, but as far as like not being able to use any rooms or things like that due to clutter or hoarding, that’s not the case in, in our house. You know, we’re definitely able to get around any of the rooms with clear, unobstructed pathways, and things like that, so.
