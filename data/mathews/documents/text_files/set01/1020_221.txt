Interviewer:
So that's interesting.
Interviewee:
I don't know.
Interviewer:
I hear you articulating that you can kind of see a paradox in stuff, like with these books.
On the one hand, you acknowledged that they're likely not going to be useful as children's books, and you have no reason to hang onto them, but on the other hand-
Interviewee:
They're not even valuable as collectibles.
I've gone and looked on the web.
They have no value.
Interviewer:
But at the same time, you appreciate them, because there are ways that they're really beautiful and well-designed-
Interviewee:
Yes.
Interviewer:
... and they meant something to you in your life.
Interviewee:
Yes.
I mean, I have three or four books that date from my mother's childhood in the 1920s, and they've been read so much by her and by my brothers and I that the pages are literally falling out, but they're so beautiful.
The drawings are so beautiful.
They're just gorgeous, so I've sort of given myself permission, when I can free up some space... some of these things are still in boxes... that if something really has that powerful a draw for me that I'm keeping something that's actually falling apart, that's okay.
I give myself permission for that.
But it's one of the reasons I'm going through all my photographs right now is that I've come to realize that a lot of them have very deep emotional meaning to me, but a lot of them don't.
One of the things that I've discovered is a whole slew of pictures dating from 1900 or so, 1900 to maybe 1930, from my grandmother and my niece, pictures of them wearing the clothing of the time, a picture of grandmother, who was the first employee for the US Census sitting in the office.
I've even gone so far as to try to find whether the Women's Museum in DC would be interested in any of these things.
No. They gave me a reference I haven't had time to follow up on yet, so I'm trying to find... I hate the idea of throwing away something that might be of some historical impact to a historian or something like that.
Yet, I only have so much time in my life, and I have to decide.
I can't do it all.
