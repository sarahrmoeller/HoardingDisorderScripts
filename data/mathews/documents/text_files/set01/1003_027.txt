Interviewer:
Why?
Interviewee:
To have more [INAUDIBLE] space, and more [inaudible :50]. Not having to make a big deal in terms of [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
So would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?
Interviewee:
No, I don't think so. I've done this at times, I've [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Okay. So what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Like it [INAUDIBLE] use your space, [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
So how is that the same or different from your behavior?
Interviewee:
I don't think [INAUDIBLE] I keep a bunch of stuff that is just not [INAUDIBLE] stuff.
Interviewer:
Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Interviewee:
Asking them [INAUDIBLE], no, I guess not.
Interviewer:
Okay. I do know you mentioned the show Hoarders. So where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
I'm not even sure I've ever seen [INAUDIBLE] I saw a bit, and it's a good TV show, [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
Nice. So what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Interviewee:
Just these images of people kind of [INAUDIBLE] with stuff piled up, [INAUDIBLE] stuff around as much as they can, [INAUDIBLE] and otherwise it's just stuff piled up.
Interviewer:
Okay. So for the next part, I will now read some vignettes and ask you some questions after each one.
Interviewee:
Okay.
Interviewer:
All right. So John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the items came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms.
His house is not always organized, but it usually is not cluttered. Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be. So do you think the person depicted could have hoarding disorder, or is their behavior more like clutter problems, and why?
Interviewee:
I guess more [INAUDIBLE] if they're keeping that extra stuff, I guess he's got the space so it's not a [INAUDIBLE] or the space the guy lives in is really small, [INAUDIBLE] not to get rid of the box [INAUDIBLE] maybe he's not going to [INAUDIBLE].
Interviewer:
So do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Interviewee:
No, not necessarily. If it's bothering him.
Interviewer:
Okay. Is this behavior similar or different to your own?
