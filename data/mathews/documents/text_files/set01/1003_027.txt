Interviewer:
Why?
Participant  004:
To have more [inaudible 00:13:37] space, and more [inaudible 00:00:13:50]. Not having to make a big deal in terms of [inaudible 00:14:00].
Interviewer:
So would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?
Participant  004:
No, I don't think so. I've done this at times, I've [inaudible 00:14:14].
Interviewer:
Okay. So what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder?
Participant  004:
Like it [inaudible 00:14:36] use your space, [inaudible 00:14:44].
Interviewer:
So how is that the same or different from your behavior?
Participant  004:
I don't think [inaudible 00:15:01] I keep a bunch of stuff that is just not [inaudible 00:15:08] stuff.
Interviewer:
Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?
Participant  004:
Asking them [inaudible 00:15:30], no, I guess not.
Interviewer:
Okay. I do know you mentioned the show Hoarders. So where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?
Participant  004:
I'm not even sure I've ever seen [inaudible 00:15:43] I saw a bit, and it's a good TV show, [inaudible 00:15:51].
Interviewer:
Nice. So what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?
Participant  004:
Just these images of people kind of [inaudible 00:16:01] with stuff piled up, [inaudible 00:16:01] stuff around as much as they can, [inaudible 00:16:01] and otherwise it's just stuff piled up.
Interviewer:
Okay. So for the next part, I will now read some vignettes and ask you some questions after each one.
Participant  004:
Okay.
Interviewer:
All right. So John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the items came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms.
His house is not always organized, but it usually is not cluttered. Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be. So do you think the person depicted could have hoarding disorder, or is their behavior more like clutter problems, and why?
Participant  004:
I guess more [inaudible 00:17:20] if they're keeping that extra stuff, I guess he's got the space so it's not a [inaudible 00:17:24] or the space the guy lives in is really small, [inaudible 00:17:24] not to get rid of the box [inaudible 00:17:24] maybe he's not going to [inaudible 00:17:52].
Interviewer:
So do you think this person should try to change their behavior?
Participant  004:
No, not necessarily. If it's bothering him.
Interviewer:
Okay. Is this behavior similar or different to your own?
