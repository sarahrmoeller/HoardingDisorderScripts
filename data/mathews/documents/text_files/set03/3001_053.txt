Interviewer1: Okay so thank you so much for meeting with us today.
Uh, I’m working with a team of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists on a project about cognitive behavioral therapy, uh, which is the type of therapy that he’s been receiving here at our clinic.
Um, for this project, we want to develop a few, short educational videos about cognitive behavioral therapy um for children and their parents that are coming in to receive it.
Um, and since cognitive behavioral therapy is a mouthful, we’ll be referring to it as CBT from now on.
Interviewee: Gotcha
Interviewer1: Um, so to start, please tell me what comes to mind when you think about CBT.
