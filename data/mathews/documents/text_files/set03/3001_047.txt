Interviewer: Um, according to the slides it said 6 videos, 15 minutes each.
So that could be different elements of CBT.
Not quite sure, that’s kind of what our focus group is trying to figure out like the when, what, how, where.
The whole aspect of it so I don’t think anything is set in stone yet.
Interviewee: Just I would always take into consideration you don’t want to make it more than 22 minutes and you want it more than 7 because you can usually get messages across to people better in that little time frame of 7 to 22 minutes for kids and for adults for that matter.
Interviewer: Note takers is there anything you needed clarified or questions on?
Interviewer2: I guess toward the beginning with the question saying like “What did you want to know about CBT when you first started?” You said you didn’t have any you could think of, so maybe now that we’ve talked about it
Interviewee: Maybe the only thing would be about it would be just the time table, but with the realization of it, for some people it’s a long process.
But just uh.
Interviewee: But a general idea would be nice.
Interviewee: a general idea yeah.
Interviewee: Like typically with this happens with this kid happens… You can’t be specific but you can go like you know, “If you work a little harder at this particular challenge, then you know you do it five days a week versus one you’re gonna move further ahead.”
Those things that we do in our own sessions, the more you do that the faster you’re gonna progress.
Those kind of things would be helpful to know that the more you do it, the more you practice and do your homework and what not, and you’ll get there faster.
Interviewer: Anything else?
I’ll go grab [NAME] and we can let you guys get out of here?
