Interviewer: Here first?
Okay. What was- do you remember what questions you had when you first came here?
As far as what to expect or what did you want to know about the therapy?
So it sounds like you had a good idea of what it entails but.
Interviewee: Well it was sort of strange because we were on the waiting list for a really long time so we ended up starting therapy with- I don’t remember it was so long ago- how it wasn’t normally done that way type situation but I don’t remember when it was supposed to be done it was like forever out long we couldn’t do it so we started seeing someone first so at first it was sort of getting a diagnosis of even what was going on and finding out that there were a combination potentially of things going.
But I lost my train of thought again…

Interviewer: That’s okay.
Interviewee: I did not eat lunch today.
Yeah, that’s the first water I’ve had today.
It’s been a crazy day.
Interviewer: I think, you know, you’re… it’s perfectly fine.
I can definitely- I’ll rephrase that.
But you talked about the diagnosis and it being a combination of things.
Interviewee: Yes.
