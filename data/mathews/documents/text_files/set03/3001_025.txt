Interviewer: Sounds good.
Now that we’ve talked about both of those, the last thing is what should we decide that they talk about in the video?
We’ve already started talking about this with the other questions, but what questions about CBT do our characters need to ask and answer within the video?
Should they find out a CBT explanation about how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life?
Interviewee: I think you can talk about that, but you have the person talking about the kind of experiences they have.
Because some people may not even… again, I didn’t even really know, and I would dare say there’s a lot of kids… and you hate to think there’s that many people out there who have issues.
Again, I think there’s a stigma attached and without question, I know there is because I know a couple other docs, my daughter has told me that their kids… you know, “this kid had a problem” and mother says “maybe you should stay away from that person if they’re being depressed,” or you know there’s a stigma attached with this.
We’re seeing a therapist.
Honestly, I’m not sure if we’re seeing a PhD OR Master’s level therapist or not psychiatrists… correct?
They’re not psychiatrists… I don’t know... maybe they are, I never looked at their diploma.
So I think there is somewhat of a stigma attached with this to a lot of people.
That’s what you’re going to have to breakthrough; in that it’s not that difficult, it’s not that uncommon.
You don’t need to be scared of it.
People don’t like to say, “Oh yeah I’m in therapy,” or my daughter’s mentioned that, because the first thing that some of the kids think is, “Ooh, stay away from her, she’s got a problem.”
Interviewer: So is that something you’d want to be discussed in the videos?
Interviewee: I think you do need to talk about that.
There’s some potential risk there, so you need to basically limit who you’re going to talk to because stuff gets around.
I was even told, “don’t tell the rest of the family.
We don’t want them thinking negatively of what’s going on.”
Then again to me, it was like, “What are we talking about here?” This doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, but yet it is.
If you’re that person that’s in therapy you’re thinking about what everyone else is thinking about your family.
You go on a trip, you see the other half of the family, and its like, “what’s going on with you?
I heard you’re in therapy.”
Negative connotations just spread.
People can say things.
They can be very hurtful, so there needs to be some thought given to that.
Interviewer: Should they ask about how it has worked for other kids?
Interviewee: I would say so.
Having examples of kids who could, again in an educational setting, stand up and basically say, “Here’s the problems that I had.
I was afraid of doing this.
I couldn’t do this, I couldn’t do that, and fortunately I talked to my mother about it… blah blah blah blah… this is what happened, and I got into this program, and it helped me to deal with it.
I still have it to a certain extent, but I know how to deal with it, and now I can go around doing A, B, C, D, and E, and I’m okay.
My life has expanded greatly.”
I think you want to show that kind of positive type situation.

Interviewer: Should they ask about how exposures work?
Interviewee: Ask about how exposures work… okay since you can’t answer a question….
Interviewer: Should they ask about the activities or the homework’s that is usually given and the need to do it outside?
Should they ask about that?
Interviewee: Ask the therapist?
Yes…
