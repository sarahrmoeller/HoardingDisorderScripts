Interviewer: Do you have any sense, and I'm coming to the end of the interview I know that I've taken up a lot of your time today.
Do you have any sense of what the life course is of animal hoarding?
Is it something that the person has been at risk for their whole life even when they're children, or is it something that develops abruptly at a certain age?
Interviewee: I think it seems to be, the literature seems to be moving in the direction that there are pre-dispositions that often show up in adolescents or even the twenties seem to become perhaps solidified a bit by mid thirties and obviously increases with age, and one of the things we haven't talked about is also as with collecting and object hoarding and so on, there is a spectrum to where you know everybody has some degree of clutter, everybody collects some things or other and everybody sometimes sees uniqueness in some of the stuff they have that other people might not see.
So that's part of the perception with some of the other pathologies, that it's not a totally alien thought-process.
For a lot of people it is an exaggeration of something that is normally there in a lot of people, but then goes to such an extreme and certainly we see that in dealing a lot with animal professionals.
One of the things when I've talked to groups, for example with the characteristic I say one of the characteristics with hoarders is it takes them, their relationships with their animals takes up most of their social interactions, most of their time, and most of their money, and then I'll ask a group of animal control officers, "How true is that of you?" And of course all the hands go up, because these are people as a profession that they spend most of their time, most of their money and most of their social interactions dealing with animal issues--but they're not hoarders.
Or I'll have people saying, "Oh gee I've got 10 cats, does that make me a hoarder?"
Interviewer: Well so that's a question because you're not, so with object hoarding as well there is this sense even among clinicians of the best way to know if somebody is a hoarder is to look at how much stuff they have, and it's striking to me that there really aren't other disorders in general where you would diagnose a person by looking at something external to them, how much they've accumulated and you point out the example of the women with the Lhasa Apso where you know, with object hoarding if you have a big enough house you will never fit the criteria for object hoarding, because you have enough space that it's never gonna get in the way of your--
Interviewee: Right, right,
