Interviewer: So I wonder, just to tease this out a little bit further, in both this idea of anosognosia or just not being able to perceive that the illness is a problem or even not being able to perceive the clutter, and also in overvalued ideation if you really believe that an item is valuable to the point that it's very unreasonable, that almost sounds like a little bit of a delusion kind of thing, you know. Like really not being able to perceive reality in a concrete way, really believing strongly in that a piece of paper or an empty can are just super super valuable or looking at a space that is unusable and you can't even walk in and just seeing no clutter. And I don't know, I guess I just kind of want to check with you and see if that's what you see with your patients, this kind of like almost delusional like lack of touch with reality or is it somewhere in between?
Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think it's a really good point and it's definitely come up within hoarding, it's come up with OCD. For example, like OCD can look sometimes like a psychotic disorder, for somebody endorsing some pretty strange beliefs and with some overvalued ideation around it that I think are the same thing, like you were mentioning with hoarding disorder like, "I need to save this for this reason" and there's this kind of fixed aspect to it, whereas it's just the way that it is, it's just right or wrong.
