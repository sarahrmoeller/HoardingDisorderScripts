Interviewer: Right. And I guess kind of these question fit into that whole idea which has a lot do with insight.
So, there’s this brown assessment of belief scale about the degree to which patients are able to correctly identify their INAUDIBLE  as being a part of a disorder.
And so my question to you is when you talk to patients, for example, one of the questions on the scale is, what do you think has caused you to have these behaviors, these hoarding behaviors?
Do these behaviors have a psychiatric or an underlying biological cause?
In talking to patients, do you think that patients see their behavior as having a biological cause, a psychological cause, a personal history cause, in cases where they do actually recognize that they have a disorder?
Interviewee: Um, I think again we’ve got some variability there, and they’re doing their best like we all are to explain why they do what they do, which is getting them into trouble.
So I wouldn’t necessarily trust what patients say about why they do what they do in terms of being the quote on quote real explanation for it.
Although, they’re certainly observers of their own behavior, so whatever they tell you is going to be useful in terms of clinical treatment.
Um, but it’s sort of another version of the same question you asked earlier if there are, if these are post hoc explanations for things.
You know, if you got a big problem, you grasp at straws to explain why.
At the same time, some of those reasons could be very valid.
