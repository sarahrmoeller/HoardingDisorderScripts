Interviewer: Have you ever had to take animals from the same person multiple times?
Interviewee: Absolutely.
Interviewer: So, they just kind of move around and accumulate and get busted and move around and accumulate.
What about on the other end temporarily?
Do you have any idea with the people that you encounter how long it’s been going on or when it started?
Interviewee: That’s sort of a [INAUDIBLE] question because all of our research is really from cross-sectional information at the time of the case, so we don’t have a longitudinal.
A longitudinal is very hard to get.
Where we do have some insight to that is from some conversation with family members.
So you’ll talk to a child, and the child will say, or an adult child will say, “Oh yeah my mother started this fifteen years ago and it drove my father away or my father died and my mother started this.
We’ve tried everything.”
[INAUDIBLE] Often what they would do is recount some traumatic event that seemed to precipitate.
Sometimes the person themselves because often times they are quite talkative and they do want to share especially if they talk about their animals [INAUDIBLE] in their lives.
Often times they would volunteer to speak.
It’s really hard to know how much of it was true and how much of it wasn’t.
