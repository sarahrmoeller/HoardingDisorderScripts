Interviewer: So I'm gonna ask you now just to talk through with me some of the diagnosis criteria. Before we begin, I just want to know if any of the elements in the criteria in the DSM-V you find particularly difficult to apply or subjective or that you wonder if different clinicians might apply differently? Does anything jump out to you from the DSM-V?
Interviewee: Yeah sure, sure. Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think ultimately the DSM runs pretty well, you know, that the heart of this diagnosis has to do with that perceived need to save and that difficulty upon attempting to discard, so that distress associated with discarding and that perceived need to save. I think that's at the heart of it and I think the DSM does outline that. I think the one criteria I might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. I think that when we think about the internet and I already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? It might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the DSM doesn't really talk about. If an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the DSM doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, I mean I'm not sure what you would diagnose. And ultimately that could be one point issue.
