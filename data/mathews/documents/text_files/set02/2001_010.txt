Interviewer: Do you think that hoarding disorder or that animal hoarding is going to be brought out or should be brought out as an official sub-type with it's own diagnostic criteria in the DSM?
Interviewee: You know, I don't think--it's an interesting question because as a practical measure in how we respond it clearly is different, it requires different resources to address in terms of the underlying psychology, there probably are differences because of the reciprocal nature of the attachment to the animals as opposed to objects, whether or not that is different enough to make it a totally different diagnosis I don't know.
The question I get a lot sometimes is if there is going to be a referral of an animal hoarder to a mental health professional, the court might often ask, "Can you refer me to someone who is a specialist in animal hoarding?" And the cases are few and far between enough in any one jurisdiction that you don't necessarily get a specialist like that, and usually what I say is we'll find someone who is familiar with dealing with hoarding disorder in general, and if they don't already know some of the other peculiarities associated with animal hoarding, we can certainly give them some of the background resources that will help improve their ability to better understand that, but I don't know that we need to treat it totally differently.
Interviewer: And that there aren't that many clinical experts anyway and you wouldn't find somebody who's an expert in the treatment of animal hoarding disorder in any case, this doesn't exist.
Interviewee: Exactly, right and Randy Frost doesn't want any more referralsS.
