Rebecca: Yeah, about the life course kind of of hoarding disorder and how it is impacted by age.
Interviewee: Yeah, so the reason I was mentioning that, which I think is a real problem in the way we often understand hoarding and I think it's a real problem with patients who understand hoarding that leads them to minimize the gains in treatment or to see them as relatively lacking in value because that legacy is still there, is that often the insight only seems to develop as a result of those years of the legacy of the accumulation. So, many people I see will say when they look back absolutely as it's been reported in other studies, you know they identified difficulty with discarding going back to their early adult years or teens or sometimes even late childhood, but the accumulation took time to get out of control and quite often I find hoarders that I see who are usually in their 40s to 60s, although I've seen some younger ones, will often say it got out of control because of environmental changes. Their spouse left them of their relationship ended or their children moved out or their aging parents downsized or died. And as a result they've been presented with even more stuff and it totally overwhelmed their ability and their limited ability to cope with it and to deal. At that point, they now recognize the problem. So, I think there's a bit of an artificiality in our saying it's more prevalent among the elderly, which is simply related to the objective reality, which is that it takes years for the accumulation in many cases to really reach that threshold of intolerance or impairment that's recognized by the individual.
Rebecca: That makes total sense. Well I really appreciate your time, I don't want to keep you any longer.
