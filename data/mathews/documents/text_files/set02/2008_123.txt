P1: So the last list prompt that we had was can you list reasons people might seek treatment for hoarding disorder
Interviewee: So why they might not why they might not?
P1: Why they might
Interviewee: Uhuh well okay so I mean the obvious one would be because their forced to by some outside entities and I think that can be very concrete you may be evicted um your landlord is making you do this um you just discovered half of your floor has been eaten away by termites and you have to have they house fumigated and you can’t because your stuff is in there so really concrete serious things all the was to subtle things um kind of uh carrots if you will like ‘my daughter said she wont let me play with the grandkids anymore’ um or you know I I have a new boyfriend and I'm embarrassed to like bring him to my house so these theses external um you know reinforces again I think they range from really kind of concrete severe um things that could happen but then they range to more subtle features as well um those are I think they main reasons I think that people come in but then there are other ones too like ‘I'm worried what will happen to my stuff when I die’ that’s another reason I think that people come in um and I think those are kind of the main reasons
P1: Okay
P2: Okay
P1: So with that we can get started with the interview and kind of the first thing we like to as everyone is uh what’s your background related to hoarding disorder and what’s your educational background and your past
