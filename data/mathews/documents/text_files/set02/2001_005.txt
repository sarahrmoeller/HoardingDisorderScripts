Rebecca: So they kind of personify or over-empathize with objects.
Interviewee: Right, whereas actually letting an animal go is actually killing it or potentially killing it, the greatest anxiety a lot of the animal hoarders have is their animals will be taken away and euthanized, and the reality is it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophesy because the animals deteriorate. We're pretty good at bringing hoarder dogs back to reasonable health, we're not very good at rescuing hoarded cats because of high instances of colony blind diseases and they're just generally more fragile and don't do nearly as well in hoarding situations, the mortality rates tend to be higher. So first of all, whereas your collection of coasters isn't going to reciprocate your presumed love and affection, but the dog does, and so because animals obviously even when kept under very poor conditions will still display affection to their inadequate care giver, that reinforces their notion of "I must be a good person because this dog loves me." And I have lots of videos of hoarders picking up the dogs and the dogs lick their face, "so how can you say I'm a bad owner? My dog loves me." So that's something you never get in pure object hoarding. The objects may bring them joy but a hoarded animal gives what looks like love, so that's a major difference.
Rebecca: It does sound like you see them as different kinds of the same thing, or at least of existing on a spectrum.
Interviewee: Right, right, the depth of potential attachment to an animal is obviously much stronger, and then in terms of being the public health aspect as I said, you know, animals pee and poor and reproduce and die, which your toasters don't.
