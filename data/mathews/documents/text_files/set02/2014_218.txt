Interviewer: Okay, well that’s the last list that I want you to make for me and I appreciate you doing that.
The idea behind that is to compare the lists that are generated by different kinds of clinicians and then also compare those lists to those generated by patients to similar prompts to see if there are major areas of disconnect.
So now I’d like to move into the more qualitative part of the interview and just to start that off if you wouldn’t mind just briefly giving me a little bit of an overview of your background related to hoarding disorder, how you encounter patients with this disorder.
Interviewee: I have been working with people with hoarding disorder and doing research on hoarding disorder for about twenty years, probably started in the late ‘90s actually.
I’ve been working with them and patients and doing research on hoarding pretty consistently since that time.
So in that twenty-year span I’ve seen a pretty large number of people with hoarding symptoms, with the actual hoarding disorder, and have delved into their phenomenology, their cognitive [INAUDIBLE], their response to various treatments, behavioral therapies, cognitive therapies, as well as medication treatments, their structural and functional brain abnormalities in our brain imaging studies, their personality traits with associated features, all that stuff.
Interviewer: Do you see patients clinically?
Interviewee: Yes.
Interviewer: And you hold a PhD in which field?
Interviewee: No, MD.
Interviewer: Oh, you’re an MD.
Interviewee: Yeah, I’m a psychiatrist.
