Interviewer: Yeah, kind of a related idea that there's been a little research about but not a ton is along the lines of kind of what you were talking about with sentimental value, and I'm wondering if you feel like there's a relationship between hoarding disorder and memory or patients' ideas about memories?
Interviewee: Mhhm, yeah, good question. I think that a lot of patients believe that I don't know, maybe for some it is the case that they do struggle with memory and maybe because of that executive function difficulty or problems, maybe there are some like cognitive developments. But I hear it a lot as just like a reason for keeping something, that "if I don't have this reminder, this cue, I won't remember." And I think I tend to challenge that in therapy, because I tend to ask people to test that out for themselves like are they sure they won't remember? What tells them they won't remember? Are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? I think it's almost like this fear that they'll forget, it's like this fear of forgetting, like if I don't have this cue then I won't remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we're doing exposures, for example, they'll come across things they haven't seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they're not actually using the items that are a cue to remember. So I might reflect that as well, like it sounds like, and maybe even asking somebody like, "Have you thought about that memory in the last 10 years even without the cue of the item?" And I think that can be a way to get at whether or not they're actually [INAUDIBLE] or if they're difficulties with memory. I think that a lot of patients do believe, or that is a reason for why a lot of people have a perceived need to keep those items, is that they're fearful that they'll forget.
