P2: Yeah um I mean that sounds good to me I certainly hadn’t thought about that until you brought it up but I think that would be a really good outcome from the interviews that were doing to try to put something like that together um and so yeah one way that we could move forward is certainly when we’ve done a bunch of interviews with with experts so we’re interviewing experts starting with experts but I think that we’re going to work out towards the periphery once we are able to with out time and kind of resource constraints and use that to make a survey that we could like you said really front line people who are understanding this disorder and I think it will be interesting to try to build that component like to what extent is that due to popular media depictions of it to you know to what extent is it really strictly based on the DSM five and you know and you know to really see you know also I would be interested in knowing how much your average frontline social worker um psychiatrist or psychologist encounters this in their practice like is this an issue everyday or is think something they have never heard about or thought about so yeah we could certainly do that when we are in a further stage in our interviews um I think that also something I think about that we have talked about would be really great to have you be involved with this we’ve talked about kind of out of theses clinicians interviews kind of coming up with a smaller group of really of key informants or key experts who we can talk through the issues um the emerge as we as we catch them like maybe have a working group of something from the study that we can touch base with periodically either via phone or email and say you know ‘we’re interested in this but what should we do?
how should we ask this question?
um how should we put this to patients?’ you know and how do we act as kind of uh a consultant or kind of advisor particularly if we move into the patient interview component um which hopefully we will be doing um at the end of the summer and the fall um and so if you would be interested in that we would
Interviewee: Yeah sure
P2: Really value your input as we because its all kind of taking shape the the wonderful thing about qualitative methodology from my perspective is its very exploratory it lets you cast a really broad net and that something that kind of where we are right now we’re going to kind of take stock of what we’ve caught in that board net and see what pieces are interesting and when we get to that it would be
Interviewee: No that sounds perfect
P2: Helpful to touch base with you again and say you know we really want to understand this is something that we found in our interviews and we really want to understand better how should we how should we move on to the next stage or how do we get at that um
Interviewee: Yeah no that sounds great really good
P1: Yeah
