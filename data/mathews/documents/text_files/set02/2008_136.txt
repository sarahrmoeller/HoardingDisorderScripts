P2: That’s really interesting um so we want to talk a little bit more about a couple of the things that you said um so one of the things that you mentioned that we’ve been thinking about is kind of the way you could or might operationalize inside of this population uh and we listed a paper that had kind of broken down the the different constructs that are and we wanted you to just kind of talk through the extent that you think that these constructs are useful with your patients so I’ll just read you the list and and we can go through them one by one or you can talk about any one of them that you think is more or less interesting so the constructs that we listed we’re defensiveness um agnosia which is just like a lack of ability to perceive the illness or whether something is wrong overvalued ideation which is the persistent and unreal belief in the potential value of items indifferent and indifference is the last one so defensiveness agnosia overvalued ideation and indifference um so just thinking through those as potential kind of pieces or parts of insight do you think that any of them are more or less important in this disorder um for different qualifications different times and how would you use those ideas to come up with a more concrete idea of insight?
Interviewee: What paper is that?
That’s great
P1: Um I think it’s uh a INAUDIBLE  from uh I I can’t remember
Interviewee: Oh of course it is NAME
P2: Yeah
Interviewee: I’ll have to read that again um I think defensiveness and overvalued ideation are relevant across the board I think indifference can be relevant and and that part about just have a complete like you're just really not able to recognize that it’s a problem yeah I think that’s really relevant for something like squalor or animal hoarding and I guess it could also be relevant for object hoarding it just I think less common
P2: Uhuh and kind of thinking through again um the process of gaining and the patients being maybe being at different levels of insight at different times do you think that theses different kind of insight are relevant at all to that idea?
Interviewee: Yeah because like the defensiveness like if you are tapping on something or like I guess I think of the defensiveness as kind of going along with the control idea um I guess maybe just something that just isn’t capturing so well is I do think is an issue with some patients is that they don’t have the same definition for what is a clean home or what’s like an uncluttered space so those would be like patients who your showing them a clutter image rating and they’re like ‘oh my god look at this room that’s a nine this is horrible how could somebody live like that’ and then you ask them what their living room looks like and their like ‘oh it think it might be like a seven’ LAUGHING and it like INAUDIBLE
P2: INAUDIBLE  most people don’t live at a seven
Interviewee: INAUDIBLE  don’t live at seven but like seven and a nine aren’t really that different to me so LAUGHING
P2: So that’s another aspect of insight that is represented here is kind of seeing their behavior um on a scale of normal
Interviewee: Yeah
