Rebecca: Another interesting diagnostic example that clinicians offered when we were talking about this criteria, and I'd love to hear what you think of this, is a patient that they treated who hoarded digital media so that their objects actually took up very little physical space, but the patient was incapable of ever deleting an email that they ever received or saved all of their browser history and was accumulating slowly hard drives filled with books on PDF and had tens of thousands of them and the physical space in their apartment actually was pretty small, but it was a similar sort of urge or a similar sort of distress with discarding and all of the justifications that the person gave for saving the digital media sounded like hoarding disorder. You know like, "I'll read all of these books someday, I might need it sometime, I'm afraid I'll forget" it didn't seem to sound like OCD but there were no physical objects in sight. So do you think that that would meet criteria for you?
Interviewee: Um, you know it would be...I've had similar cases, perhaps even a bit more extreme where there were multiple screens and a person was kind of unable to, they had to constantly kind of monitor things and then back in the day of VHS tapes and those kinds of things, the accumulation of that kind of technology, VCRs and things which generally speaking does take up quite a lot less space. In the absence of saving other objects, I'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. For me, the times that I have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly. One case that I can think of, yeah so I don't think strictly it would been the criteria because it wouldn't meet that interference piece, but if it were in the context of other things, perhaps.
