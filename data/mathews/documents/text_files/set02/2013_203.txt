Interviewer: Yeah, exactly right.
So that was part of the reason of kind of branching out and trying to talk to people who might be seeing CUTS_OFF.
Interviewee: Let me give you just a tad bit of background on this too–
Interviewer: Sure.
Interviewee: –because again whether this even fits in this is a separate issue, I think, rather an important one.
The reason we got started on this, this whole sort of research effort began, was because I had encountered as a shelter director when I was a shelter, I’m a veterinarian by training and I was a running a small animal shelter outside of Philadelphia.
We also invested cases of animal neglect or abuse and mistreatment.
So, we got this call to go visit and look into this house and the call was made by the Pizza Hut.
These two ladies, the complaint was that there were two ladies eating out of their dumpster and bringing the food into the Pizza Hut to eat and then going back to their house to sort of tucked off the street a little bit behind the Pizza Hut.
So, they weren’t really concerned about the ladies at all, but they were very concerned about the ladies bringing the thrown away Pizza Hut food back into the Pizza Hut and the nature of the complaint and the reason they called us was because they said well [INAUDIBLE] and there’s dog problem here.
So they wrote this into doing something maybe they couldn't get anybody else to look into it, maybe other people have blown them off which is not uncommon, but they found us so we looked into it from a [INAUDIBLE] perspective.
When we got there and finally got into the house and met the ladies, we saw what was going on and we were just dumbfounded.
We had never seen anything like this in our lives and it didn’t have a name and just didn’t know how to deal with it and basically got blown off by everybody that we tried to talk to about it.
