Rebecca: I mean, it's tricky because you have this intended use criteria, and then you have to start asking yourself, "Well who's intent?" You know like, if you have a four-bedroom home and three of those rooms are filled with stuff, but there's only one person who needs a bedroom, you know like is that acceptable? Is that the intended use for that person?
Interviewee: Yeah, I mean I guess at that point I'm willing to let it not be hoarding. If they're not seeking treatment, right, so they're not having distress either directly or indirectly due to the hoarding, and they're living happily in their one thing, that then goes to my more "let people do what they want" feeling, like don't be a nanny state. Okay, fine, let's focus on those people who do have distress and do have interference and come in with the insight or not, and not worry about that person. But it would be different the replicate to me if I was doing an interview, like I said, a community-based survey to look at the prevalence of hoarding, would I really look at that person and say, "Nope, they don't have hoarding"? I don't know.
Rebecca: I mean I guess it also presents a problem for research, because if you're excluding, like for instance, anyone who's space is managed by someone else, you're never gonna get kids in. If you're excluding people who are not experiencing distress, then your really severe hoarders are never--
Interviewee: Yeah, excellent point. From a public health perspective, you're right, that's the danger. If I just said, "Fine, I'll let them be subclinical because they're not interference or distress currently" and I'll move on with my life, that might be fine in the short term because we're giving treatment to the people we want, but in terms of identifying the prevalence of the problem or finding those people before they die in all their relatives inherit their stuff and you create other problems, it doesn't really fix it.
