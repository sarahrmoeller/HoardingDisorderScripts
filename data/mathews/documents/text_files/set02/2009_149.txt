Interviewer: What do you mean by means?
Interviewee: Well money, insight, help, family members, etcetera.
So I mean we certainly see people who have enough space such that their clutter is confined to one or two rooms, and then we have people who live in huge spaces in rural areas where their entire space is full of stuff.
And there it’s that, sometimes, either they don’t have the ability themselves to move things around, the insight, the desire, there’s nobody else living with them, or they have severe hoarding.
So space does play a part, there’s no question, but I think… and you have to take that into account when you’re looking at somebody with a big home or with a lot of space, especially when you get into that tricky zone, which is, you know, the mild to moderate level.
Severe hoarding you’ll see in all levels of space.
Again, the key issue is difficulty discarding, and when I see somebody who has a really big home I ask them, you know, “If there was nobody controlling your stuff, what would this house look like?” or, “In the spaces that are exclusively yours, can you use them or are there spaces that just have stuff in them that you no longer use for their intended purposes?” So sometimes people will turn bedrooms into junk rooms rather than a guest room, for example.
Interviewer: Ok
Interviewee: And that’s ok if they go in and out and use it as a workroom, but if it’s got stuff in it and they never walk into it then that’s an indication.
Interviewer: Ok.
Do you see differences in how much free space an individual needs to live normally?
So, you know, what is a comfortable amount of space?
For example, some people like to have open counters, while others prefer to have knickknacks and things.
Could this be a similar, but more extreme difference?
Interviewee: Not sure I follow that question.
