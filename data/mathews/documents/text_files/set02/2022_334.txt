Interviewer: Yeah, I'll follow up our conversation today with an email. We're actually gonna start, I told you at the beginning, we're gonna start talking to patients shortly and I'm actually building a whole section. So we have, this is totally off topic from the interview, but we have a partnership with NAME's lab and hopefully NAME's lab and they both have large kind of research studies going on in hoarding disorder, so a large body of patients who have already consented to do research and we're gonna be calling and doing interviews and asking them about home and what they think of when they think of home and how their space, how items contribute to the building of their home. So, if that would be something that you would like to help us to design, that's the stage that we're at--the design stage--and hopefully we'll be starting within the next couple of months with the patient interviews, so if that's interesting to you I would love to like really really truly deeply would love to have mentorship on that because it's something that I've been doing totally on my own.
Interviewee: Yeah for sure, let's continue the conversation about it.
