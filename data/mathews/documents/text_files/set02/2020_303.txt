Rebecca: So, could a person have insight and say, "Yeah I have hoarding disorder and this behavior is abnormal and its impairing my life, but it's my life and I want to keep my items" is that a patient with insight, or where would insight kind of fit into that for that patient? They recognize their disorder is real, but they don't want to change it. They don't feel distressed by it, could you have insight without distress?
Interviewee: Yes, I'd say if you recognize that they still have a problem in the way they relate to stuff, they're still insightful about one aspect of the problem, they may say it's poor insight, depending on how they described it and depending on what I was objectively hearing about their life.
Rebecca: And when you see patients, how much insight do they typically have when they come to you?
Interviewee: So the population I see typically ranges between fair to good insight, because I am a psychiatrist to which people are referred for treatment. I'm not out there in the community, I'm at a hospital setting, a tertiary care hospital setting. I mean I get the occasional one where they're coming just because their family members have pushed them, but they're a small minority of the people I see myself. 
Rebecca: And so when you're seeing people who have reasonably good insight, do you have any idea how they gained insight on their own or what that process looked like for them?
Interviewee: I don't know that I do have a good feel for that, it typically comes on gradually but no I would say I don't have any specific understanding of what triggered them to begin to recognize that it was a problem.
