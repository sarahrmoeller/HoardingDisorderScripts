Interviewer 2: And kind of along those same lines, just kind of thinking through the idea of intended use, because, you know, [INAUDIBLE 43:47] tend to use space in different ways. So, for example, someone who doesn’t ever cook, they might see it as appropriate to store things on their stove. How do you kind of figure that into determining what a good intended use, you know, of the space is? Do you kind of notice those are not for storage or is it a little more flexible than that, and how do you negotiate what counts as [INAUDIBLE 44:09] and what doesn’t?
Interviewee: Well, I think… I would say, you know, kind of separate from what the normal part is, the safety risk. So, if… even if they don’t cook, the stove is still considered like a hot space, and so if you’re storing things there even if you don’t use the stove it could still be a fire hazard, you want to keep items away from a potential combustible situation. But, otherwise I think it’s clearly… if it’s intentionally defined in a particular way. So, let’s say that there’s a second bathroom in the house, and nobody is using it. If that bathtub then gets converted for using for some kind of storage, so it’s not being used for its intended purpose as architects and builders designed it, but they weren’t using it for that purpose anyway. So, if it is being used for storage there would be the question of why is there inadequate storage elsewhere in the house? Is it a function of too much stuff overall, or is it making a distinction? This is actually what I did. I kept clothes that were being donated stored in the hallway bathroom kept in the tub because we never used it, but then my dad came and visited and turned the shower on and got all the clothes wet by accident. So, it’s a question of is it planned out? I think. And, what is the harm component or the potential risk associated with it? Just for the level of in the living space, not looking at the reasoning behind keeping those items, anyways.
