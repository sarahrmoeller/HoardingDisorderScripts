P2: Mhm um okay so the last piece of the interview we’d like to go through with you is again about the way that patients come in to treatment or come in for um for studies um an just based on your experience we’ve kind of covered some of this already so um I don’t want to make you repeat yourself too much but just when thinking of a patient or just kind of in the form of a narrative could you please describe the typical process that usually occurs to get patients to your office either for treatment or for study and participation what happens in your experiences to patients before they get there?
Interviewee: Um I think that it is very different depending on whether its for a research study or whether its for a treatment reason um and so for research study I I find that a lot of these patients are kind of  interested and intrigued about learning stuff and being part of a bigger thing and so for research um you know as long as they kind of have the whereabouts to self identify and say ‘oh I many have this hoarding thing’ um then we find it pretty easy to  have them come in um they are also the only patient groups I've ever worked with where people are you know often enough where it's noticeable um they refuse payment (laughing) like ‘no no it's okay take the money’ they’re like ‘no I want to just help contribute to science’ you know it's like that’s great good thank you um for the treatment piece of it I oftentimes think they have reached a certain point where they are in distress or impairment or the like griping from outside forces has reached high enough threshold where it's finally become pain enough for the patient to come in so I think the conversation is really different but even then they aren’t always ready to purse CBT treatment um in which case you know then uh well that’s part of the reason we have them go though the help group first and then the CBT group 
P2: Um so just in terms of the motivations that they have do you feel like the people who are involved in getting them to your office are most frequently um like family members and friends and if so which family members in in particular do you find are the most involved with this process?
Interviewee: Um well what’s interesting is that when we have family members call um usually those are folks that the patients themselves are super not ready to change and then if its cases where the patients themselves is calling in um often times we don’t in those cases work with the family does that make sense?
P2: So if the family’s calling then usually it's because the patient won't but if the patient is ready we don’t really hear from the families as much (1:44:41) 
Interviewee: Right the the few exceptions to that is if the patient is living with their family 
P2: Mhm mhm
