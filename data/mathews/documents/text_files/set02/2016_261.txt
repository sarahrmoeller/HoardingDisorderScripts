Interviewer: Okay. Well, I really appreciate your time. We're just about at the end of the interview, I just want to close by asking you if you feel like there's anything important that we didn't touch on. And just to follow that by saying what you think the most important things that we still don't know about hoarding disorder that you would like to know. I know that that's a very big question because there were a lot of fun moments. But if you were to answer one question, what question…
Interviewee: Okay. I, off the top, I can think of something that we haven’t talked about that’s really important. I do think what we don’t know enough about is how to get people engaged in treatment. I think there’s good reason to think there are an awful lot of hoarders out there that nobody ever treats. And the percentage of them are a substantial percentage of are [INAUDIBLE] are unlikely to seek treatment or, I don’t know, even think that they themselves have much of a problem. And I don’t think we know anywhere near enough about how to help them.
Interviewer: Yup, yup. Okay. Well that's hopefully what we're going to try to get at with this project and we were really, as you know, I’m going to stop the recording. Thank you so much for your time again.
