Interviewer: And, in your experience, the patients that come to you with high levels of insight already, how have they, or do you have any sense of how they have gained that insight on their own or before they've come to you?
Interviewee: I’m sorry, I lost a little bit of what you said [INAUDIBLE]
Interviewer: So when patients come to you and already are self-identifying as people who have a problem with hoarding disorder, do you have any sense of how they gained that insight or what the process was that led them to let them to come and seek treatment?
Interviewee: That’s a tough one. I’m not sure that I can pin down a particular sense or how they got there. Yeah, so sometimes it’s, again, somebody has spoken to them about something or they’ve gotten in a situation where they’re facing constant criticism. [INAUDIBLE] that this is not working well. Others, you know, sometimes see it because of, it can be a case of where they’re dealing with other family members who are hoarders, actually kind of helps them understand that they had a problem too. Or, I had a woman who I worked with for a while, who got stuck trying to deal with her father’s estate, essentially, had tremendous piles of things and she was a hoarder herself, but her siblings were not. And, so there was this, you know, first of all, the experience of trying to deal with her father’s stuff and dealing with her siblings who were dispositioned to things, I think led to her understanding that it was really a problem.
Interviewer: Okay. So it sounds like sometimes they can have conflicts with family members or other times they can have experienced it with a family member.
