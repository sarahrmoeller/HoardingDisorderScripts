Interview 024
Interviewee: [NAME 0:01] obviously, yeah, I work for her and am part of her lab. I am a clinical technologist, so I am much more on the clinician side of things. I am involved in our research studies, but I'm definitely more knowledgeable about clinical practice, so you know I could speak to that and I could ultimately do my best to kind of represent the lab. Although I am definitely not the head of the different studies going on, although I do kind of know about them, so I'll be able to give you what I can.
Rebecca: Sure, yeah perfect. And again, you know, you might be tempted to say that you're not the right person to answer some of these questions, but I mean I think that you're--what the study is really aiming to get at is perception, so I think that'll be perfect. Just to give you a framing of what we're gonna do today, our interview has two sections. The first section uses a technique that's called free listing, and the idea behind free listing is, it's a little bit like a fluency test. We will give you a prompt and then we'll ask for you to give us off the top of your head a list that comes to mind. So an example of a prompt might be, "Could you please list for me all the animals that you can think of" and then you would go ahead and say, "Dog, cat, lion, tiger" and keep going until you can't think of any more. And the difference between this and a fluency test is that it's not timed at all, and we are most interested in what items you list and what order they're listed in, and we want to get an exhaustive list from you, so feel free to take your time. And the idea again is just to generate a list, so fairly short responses if possible.
Interviewee: Okay.
