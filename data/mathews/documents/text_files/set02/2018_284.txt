Interviewer: Okay. Okay. Well so that's the, that's most of the questions that I have for you today.
I really appreciate your time.
These were very interesting questions to go through with you.
Just to close out, I'd like to ask you a really big vague question.
So for you, what do you think the biggest things that we still don't know about hoarding disorder are?
Or if you could answer one question about hoarding disorder, what would it be?
Interviewee: I think there’s probably like an early developmental sequence, like an epigenetic sequence that combines like a genetic predisposition and early life experience to create this hoarding disorder.
Like, harsh criticism from parents who also shows like an over episode that good, and that, social anxiety and fear, like soul meant this urge and I feel like there's lots of research studies on any one individual factor, but not like this holistic picture of how like your genes and your parenting and your attachment and your mental health problems converge and combine to create this, like I call it final common pathway.
Interviewer: So the ways that all these different factors come together.
Interviewee: Correct.
Interviewer: Okay.
Well, I really appreciate your time today.
Thank you so much for speaking with me.
