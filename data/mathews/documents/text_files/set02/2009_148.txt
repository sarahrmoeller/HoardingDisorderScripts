Interviewee: That’s hard. I don’t determine value in any concrete way. Some of it is you ask the patient about what they think the real value of it is, and that gives you an assessment of insight in addition to assessment of value. But actual value can be assessed, and I do assess it using cultural norms. For example, junk mail for most people in the society that we live in would have no actual value. Sentimental value is something that’s a little harder to assess, and it’s harder to apply cultural norms, and so some of it is volume, some of it is the person’s own thought about how sentimental something is or isn’t. But the value is tricky, actual value is tricky, because it’s not just monetary.
Rebecca: Yeah. Another phrase, “difficulty discarding possessions results in accumulation that congests and clutters active living spaces.” I know that we’ve talked about this. Does home size play into this at all?
Interviewee: Home size does play into it. Although you’ll find that people who really have hoarding disorder will fill up almost all of the spaces regardless of the size of their home, and I think what… There’s two things that matter, home size is one. In a single room occupancy hotel you’re going to have more trouble with clutter than you are if you live in a mansion. That said, the difficulty discarding is still the issue, and means rather than home size, I think, is the biggest problem. People who don’t have means may, even if they live in a big space, still have clutter because they don’t have the means to organize it, put it away, hide it. They don’t, you know… People who have means may do better in organizing things, putting them away out of sight, etcetera. Some of that is insight.
