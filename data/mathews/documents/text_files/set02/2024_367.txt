Rebecca: For that criteria, the difficulty discarding results in accumulation that congest and clutter and substantially compromise intended use, I wonder also if you think that external factors may play a role in that substantially compromising of intended use. For example, if somebody is very wealthy and lives in a extremely large home, versus somebody who lives in a trailer and has less space, is it possible to be so wealthy that you never compromise your intended...you know, your space's intended use because you have many storage units, for example? 
Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that's a really good question. I think that definitely could be possible and I think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that I've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.
