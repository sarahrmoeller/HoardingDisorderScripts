P2: That’s part of what we've been wondering if it is a doctor thing is it a you know perhaps the background in OCD or if you are background in social work or I don’t know but it will be very interesting to look I think at at the end to see why that is
Interviewee: Mhm
P1: Yeah
Interviewee: So sorry to interrupt NAME
P1: No um yeah um so the next criteria we wanted to bring up and kind of discuss with you is uh the this is kind of something we had talked about the discarding of possessions they have and accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas thereby compromising their intended use um so
P2: You know
P1: Yeah go ahead NAME
P2: No uh we were going to ask you exactly what you had answered us already
Interviewee: Okay
P2: Determination as to how much stuff is is too much depending on things like house size um you know a lot of factors with that but we also wanted to ask since we kind of already talked about it I'm just going to loop by that question if it's okay um but we also wanted to ask about the idea of um substantially compromised use um and how you view as a clinician what the patients intent for the space might be um I don’t know if that make sense as a question you know like uh the example that we give is if a person doesn’t cook what is the the intended use of their kitchen and what’s a normal intended use
Interviewee: Mhm right yeah yeah no like uh the little lady who’s awesome she ninety-two she’s done all of our studies she still wicked smart she love to entertain she's got this group of lady friends that she likes to have over and they play bridge she gets all of her meals delivered she does not need her kitchen because of her you know physically she’s she’s rather compromised just because of her age so she'd rather and she doesn’t really sleep in a bed anymore she sleep in a one of those lazy boy recliners because it helps her get up um so you know her bedroom is just a storage facility that’s what it is her kitchen is just another closet she doesn't need it for anything uh she has access to the sink and she has access the fridge which is really she has access to her microwave and that what really all she needs um so do we give her that criterion or not?
I do because like there’s a lot of layers to the onion um she can’t find some document that are fairly important to her if a fire were to break out in one of those back room she’d be toast if there was some other problem that would happen in the like cave that is the rest of the house you’d never know and it could be pretty serious um she had like a rat get in right and like for that poor exterminator guy trying to find like where that rat is living like is a serious issue LAUGHING so yeah it's really subjective I think
P2: Okay
P1: And there are other things that kind of have to come into that judgment
Interviewee: Yeah
