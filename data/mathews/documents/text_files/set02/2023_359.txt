Interviewer: Yeah, I was asking if you have had the experience of having a really challenging diagnosis where you were't sure if something was truly hoarding or was either another mental health diagnosis or something else entirely. Have you ever had that experience, and can you think of an example of a time where you were really unsure if something was hoarding or wasn't?
Interviewee: Yeah we had, just a quick one and then unfortunately I'm gonna have to run, I'm getting distracted because people are at my doorS, they keep coming back to my door every once in a while, so sorry about that. So, yeah I mean in one case there was a person who was, a lot of what they were collecting was like food wrappers and containers and so forth, and there were a lot of them in addition to other things, and it was hard to know whether it was hoarding or whether it was depression or if it was eating issues as well, and the way that at first the person was answering questions and based on conversation it seemed like they were having difficulty letting go of the papers and whatever the food came in, the containers and stuff. And then, but overtime, a pretty brief time, it became clear that actually it was the clutter that was attached to that and a number of other things that was really more related to the depression, and also some eating disorder issues as well. But you know, in terms of the specific items that they're holding onto and also in terms of how they were kind of answering the typical questions, it seemed it was hoarding but something kind of just didn't fully match, and so with more exploration and over time it became clear that the treatment specific for hoarding wasn't really a fit, it was more a need to address something in the mental health issues that were going on that were really more salient and the clutter was more secondary. So that's kind of just like a quick example of when it's come up, and sometimes it's kind of teasing it out of them as well.
Interviewer: Well I want to be respectful, I appreciate your time.
