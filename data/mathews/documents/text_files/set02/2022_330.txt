Rebecca: Another really interesting example that I read about is an example of a couple, and maybe you've heard of this it's a pretty famous story, they lived in a very small apartment in New York city, which was entirely filled up with objects to the point that they couldn't use the space, they couldn't host people, they couldn't sit down in their own apartment. It just so happened that it was an art collection, and when they died it was an extremely valuable art collection that they had accumulated over the course of like 60 years of living in New York city and it was all donated to the MET and valued at like $6 million, but prior to them dying nobody was able to view the art, nobody was able to enter the apartment, it was basically an unlivable space. And I guess the question I have is does that count as hoarding disorder if they're hoarding appropriately valuable items in a small space that they can no longer use as an apartment? 
Interviewee: Yeah, it's a very interesting question because in a way it doesn't meet that criteria of value. But for me, I guess what I'm articulating a lot here is my own weighting of those criteria, so that if it's causing interference in the ability to use their space for the purpose intended, regardless of the actual value, that other criteria weighs a bit heavier for me probably than the actual value. I find that a more subjective criteria in lots of ways.
