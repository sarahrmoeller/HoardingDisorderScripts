Interviewer 1: Ok. So we think the best thing to do is to send a follow-up time with you by email and, again, to finish the rest of the questions we have at that point and then maybe to ask you some additional questions that will arise as we kind of continue our interviews.
It that an okay way to proceed?
Interviewee: Yeah.
That will be fine with me.
Interviewer 2: Ok.
Interviewer 1: Ok.
Interviewer 2: Um, excellent.
Interviewee: So you’ll be in touch…
Interviewer 1: We really, really…
Interviewee: We’ll set up another time?
Interviewer 1: Yeah we will.
Interviewee: Ok.
Interviewer 1: Yeah.
We’ll send an email as we get off the call.
We really appreciate your time and all of your work has been really great to read and this has been an extremely interesting conversation and I think that we both will look forward to continuing it when you have more time.
Interviewee: Alright.
I will too.
Interviewer 2: Yeah, thank you very much.
