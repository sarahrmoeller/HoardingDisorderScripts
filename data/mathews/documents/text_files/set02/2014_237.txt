Rebecca: And just kind of as a closing out question, for you what do you think is the biggest unanswered questions about this disorder?
Interviewee: Well, I think there’s several. I think number one, we don’t know the pathophysiology and unfortunately that’s true for most of our psychiatric disorders. It is so under researched, there’s only a handful. I mean you’re working with (NAME, 1:07:30) and she’s one of the handful of people that are actually looking into this and trying to identify what are the brain abnormalities, is there a particular pattern. Which then leads into the second question which is, what are the best treatments for it? Because the current treatments we have are kind of plus-minus, they’re not all that great. Our group has done some of the medication studies and they’re kind of okay, but so far there hasn’t been a controlled trial. My concern is that even the good results we got in our open trials they might not pan out in controlled studies. Because everybody who treats this certainly sees a lot of people who are non-responders to the same medications and the behavioral therapy, while it’s good, the response rates and the degree of response is not all that great and I think we could do a lot better. Some of the new things like adding in cognitive remediation that (NAME, 1:08:30) has worked at looks like its good and it’s helped and it’s improved response rates. I think we still have a long ways to go in learning about what treatments are going to work best, whether it’s medication, behavioral therapies, or other. We don’t know nearly enough about what are the underlying substrates of it and what’s the pattern of pathophysiology. I think those are the two big things.
Rebecca: Well, I really appreciate your time.
