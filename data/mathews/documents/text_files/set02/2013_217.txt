Interviewer: Right, do you find that people are like frankly psychotic very often?
Like they are caught hearing voices?
Interviewee: It’s a very vocal delusion is all I can say.
When it does occur, often times these are individuals who are able to plan and execute very complex strategies to maintain their behavior.
So, you certainly wouldn’t put them into the psychotic category, I don’t think.
But when it comes to specific outcome of their behavior, the consequences, they seem to be able to just INAUDIBLE that out and draw a blank.
You have to be very high functioning.
You know, we’ve had people that are, there’s been mental health professionals, famous stories of psychologists and psychiatrists who have been hoarders.
How do you INAUDIBLE that one out?
Interviewer: It’s like a total blindspot about this one–
Interviewee: I mean there was NAME and NAME and their book NAME about a woman who was a psychiatrist in New York and she was a cat hoarder and she used to make her patients work with her cats as part of their therapy and she would encourage the patient to go home and collect their own population of cats.
Interviewer: Wow, that’s a whole new problem.
That’s a whole new level of problems of insight.
Well, I really appreciate your time.
