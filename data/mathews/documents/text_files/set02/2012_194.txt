Interviewer: Right.
So just to return for a second to the DSM5 criteria..
Interviewee: Yeah yeah.
I’m sorry I am getting way ahead, I apologize.
Interviewer: No no, I appreciate it.
It’s a very interesting question and its very interesting to see what different clinicians have to say.
The next DSM5 criteria I’d like you to think through with me reads quote: “the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congests and clutters active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use” and so the follow up I have on that one is how do you make the determination of how much stuff is too much?
And how do things like the size of their home, or the amount of free space they have access to, or whether other people live with the, play into a diagnosis?
Interviewee: It’s a really good question because when two people engage in the exact same behavior but one has a big house and one has a small house you end up with different levels of clutter.
Interviewer: Right.
Interviewee: And I don’t know if we have a good way around that, I don’t know if we have a good way of resolving that.
We know that without significant clutter there it’s probably not hoarding but it’s important to recognize there are an awful lot of other variables also impact the degree of clutter in the home besides hoarding.
Interviewer: Right, and so another example might be if they live with a partner who cleans up after them.
Do they then not have hoarding disorder because they don’t have clutter?
Interviewee: Right.
Right, well that piece is fortunately… I think that the way the DSM criteria is worded: ‘if clutter is absent only because of the actions of another” so you can get around that one.
But you raise an important question that I don’t think we have resolved very well, which is what about what your current living status is and does that affect whether or not we would diagnosis you with hoarding disorder.
