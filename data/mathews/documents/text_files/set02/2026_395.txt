Interviewer: And when you think about the individuals you've encountered with this disorder, do you feel like it's more connected to the reasons that they give for saving individual items? Or do you feel like there's a component that is about how they like their space. So, maybe patients might describe their space as being cozy, or needing to feel enclosed by items. How do you feel about that?
Interviewee: I think it depends on the person. We've heard both, sometimes in combination and sometimes not. And so I think it's tough because it's such an individualized set of reasons for why people save, right, and I think that that's part of the challenge. So, for some people it might be a feeling of safety, while for other people it might be more utilitarian.
Interviewer: And when you talk to people and when you have talked to people about their reasons for this behavior, and this is totally subjective, this is 100% your opinion, do you feel like the reasons that people give for saving items are what's driving the behavior, or do you feel like the behavior comes first and then the person is kind of justifying the behavior by giving these reasons? Does that make sense? Is it more of an impulse that the person does, they save and then when you ask them why they give you a reason why? Or is the reason really driving the behavior?
Interviewee: You know, that's a good question and I actually don't feel like I know the answer.
