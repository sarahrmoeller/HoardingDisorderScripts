Rebecca: That seems to be something that's a little bit different than with object hoarding is, while there's these DSM-V criteria that are applied that are applied to individuals to see if they are individuals with hoarding disorder, but it seems that process of diagnosis happens quite infrequently with animal hoarding, it tends to be a situation where there either is or is not legal intervention necessary and that's as far as it goes.
Interviewee: Did I send you, or I can send you if you don't have it the article that [NAME 37:47] and I wrote on case outcomes in--
Rebecca: No you didn't but I would love it, yeah
Interviewee: Do you have it?
Rebecca: No, I can look it up though but I would love it if you could send it to me, I spoke to [NAME 37:57].
Interviewee: Yeah I definitely will send it to you, it's now probably we really should revisit that because obviously we're much farther down the road, I should talk to [NAME 38:07] about re-doing it, it was a little difficult to put together obviously as a follow up. We followed more than 50 cases and obviously there's much more psychological--that was even before the recognition of hoarding disorder, so it's time to do a follow-up. But that will at least give you the early stages of recognition of the problem, what the different case outcomes were. A major shift I've seen probably in the last five years and particularly since the inclusion of hoarding disorder is much less advocacy for jail time and we've all obviously pushed for that and that's part of the general trend, again what we're talking with the prosecutors today about is basically a trend away from incarceration in general or as someone, one of our California DAs said, "nobody in California goes to jail anymore" [laughs]. And of courts all the courts are pushing for well can't we have intervention treatment or whatever, unfortunately we don't have the magic treatment and as you well know, even in object hoarding cases the recidivism rate is still quite high and in animal hoarding seems to be even higher.
