Interviewer: So another example that was a real example that was given was a person who had a patient who hoarded exclusively digital media, who never deleted any emails and downloaded thousands and thousands of digital books and had hard drives filled with books that they would never read, but felt that they might someday; but, also didn't clutter their space because all of it was electronic media.
So like, thousands of movies, thousands of digital content essentially.
And the clinician was perplexed because if they were physical--
Interviewee: Yeah, I think in that one I would get kind of pragmatic, and maybe with the millionaire as well, in the sense that we have limited clinical resources and treatment resources so, if they person is not presenting to treatment, if it's just a hypothetical thought experiment, I would not be bothering to diagnose them with hoarding disorder.
Same with the millionaire, but then the interesting thing to me is actually when they're coming in to treatment seeking.
Once you're coming in for treatment, it's often time the case that you're having some distress or conflict about it, and at that point you've been the distress criteria and it doesn't matter if you have some weird management system, it's the clutter I guess that's the problem, not whether they're meeting interference or distress.
So, I guess yeah maybe those two cases wouldn't be technically meeting for hoarding.
I mean, definitely the digital person I would be probably not putting them down as hoarding, even though I can see why behaviorally, in terms of their beliefs, it's mimicking that and that the treatments could be quite similar.
