Interviewer: Ok. And if you were to kind of picture a typical hoarding patient, or a typical patient with this disorder, what do they look like?
What are the demographics like?
Interviewee: Demographics for serious hoarding behavior, uh, someone who is in their fifties, mid- to late- fifties.
It appears to be, although studies differ, in general, it appears that it is equally prevalent in men and women.
In terms of appearance, there is very little that you can tell by looking at someone, except in some cases in severe hoarding cases there’s some dishevelment on part of the hoarding client, but that’s not the case with the majority of them but occasionally you see that.
Um, what else?
Interviewer: Some factors, you know, like socioeconomic status, race or religion, or regional – rural/urban.
Something like that.
Interviewee: Yeah, not much difference for rural/urban.
Some differences in socioeconomic status.
It is associated with lower levels of socioeconomic status, although the association is not a perfect correlation.
So we see that it is a cause of spectrum, but it is more frequent in people who have, typically have more financial difficulties than people who don’t.
They often don’t pay their taxes for a while in part of the disorganization.
Um, oh gosh, what else?
Interviewer: Race and ethnicity?
Interviewee: I don’t think… there’s not much evidence out there about race and ethnicity.
What we do see in some cases that it is, it appears to be as prevalent in African American groups as in Caucasian groups and perhaps maybe even more so.
And other than that, there’s not a lot of evidence.
There’s evidence that it’s sort of broad culturally.
You see this in every culture.
Not many studies have been done in different cultures outside of the Western world, but there are evidences of this in the East.
In China, Japan, for instance, there appears to be similar prevalence rates, but beyond that, not much culturally or at least internationally.
