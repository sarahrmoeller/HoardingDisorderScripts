P2: That is really interesting I will be really interested to hear what you find um just kind of concretely how do you operationalize that in terms of when you look at a patent in front of you and you have to make that determination how do you make it clinically?
Interviewee: You mean like differentiating between the collector and the
P2: Mhm or the clutter the cluttered person who you know um who has a lot of stuff versus a hoarder versus somebody who has difficulties discarding but as you said maybe doesn’t have control over their space how do you when you're sitting with a patient um and you're not sure how do you determine if their saving behavior is normal or abnormal?
Interviewee: Mhm yeah I think I mean uh partially what we want to do with this data is to try to get better at differentiating that so they way we recruited for that study was to use really strict exclusion inclusion criteria if you’re in the hoarding group you have to meet for DSM five criteria for hoarding disorder okays so it's pretty strict how we define that inclusion with the healthy controls you have to have to not meet that diagnosis and you have to be below the means of that SIR okay so with in the like normative healthy range of on the saving inventory revised and then for the collectors the only criteria we used for them was that they could not meet the criteria for hoarding disorder which most of them did not meet for two reasons one they didn’t have the clutter and then two they had difficulties discarding but only with respect to the thing they collected let me tell you there are so many weird collections out there LAUGHING that alone was fascination um like they guy who collected fire hydrants he had a hard time he had extreme difficulty discarding his fire hydrants LAUGHING but he did not have a difficulty discarding anything else
P2: Okay so perhaps these is INAUDIBLE  making this distinction there is an element of knowing being able to value some things over others
Interviewee: Mhm but we’ll see if that holds true right because we’re going to look at the data dimensionally and and I would not characterize collectors a healthy
P2: Great so perhaps it’s a spectrum as well
Interviewee: Yeah for sure and and ya know that’s good that’s we did a INAUDIBLE  study on hoarding and it at least looking at the least and looking at difficulties discarding and clutter it is a dimension
P2: Great
Interviewee: Tts is a spectrum it's not that there is a latten taxon on hoarding versus non hoarding
P2: Great okay what about in terms of demographics of patients with hoarding disorder what do they tend to look like when you think of a hoarder when you picture them what would they typically be just in terms of oh age race economic status perhaps region background if they are real or urban
P2: Um I'm laughing because these are all complicated questions um and I'm not talking to the media so I'm not trying to be INAUDIBLE
P2: Yeah and it’s a confidential interview so don’t be like I said the idea is to gage where people where the field is and what we know right now what we what are INAUDIBLE
Interviewee: Yeah no no no I understand
P2: Well we don’t need an evidence based citation for what you're about to say
