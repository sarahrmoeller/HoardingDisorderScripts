Interviewer: We talked in the beginning of the interview about the reasons that people give for keeping their animals or for hoarding animals, and I wonder if in your mind those reasons are actually what is driving their behavior, or are those reasons kind of a post-hoc justification for what is a kind of fundamental underlying need to--?
Interviewee: Yeah, I think that's closer to the reality partly because of the actual situation.
They say, "Well I'm saving these animals or otherwise they would just be abandoned or would die" or whatever, and that's I guess another quality we really haven't discussed.
It's one of the things that's almost universal in the animal hoarders, is this strong aversion to euthanasia under any conditions.
The big disconnect between animal hoarders, rescue hoarders in particular and conventional animal shelters or animal rescue groups that will euthanize animals for illness or extreme behavior problems or whatever--is accepting the notion of a life not worth living.
Our view in conventional animal protection is there are worse things than death for an animal, or for a human in my view, and living a life of pain and suffering with open bleeding wounds and severed spines and things like that are in view of most of us a life of not worth living, a fate worth death.
That concept of a life not worth living is totally aliens to animal hoarders.
What you hear time and time again is, "Well it's alive," and coupled with that is their own fear of mortality--and again, that I think relates back to the fact that for many hoarders and animal hoarders, one of the triggering events seems to be loss, death of a child, death of a sibling, death of a parent, death of a spouse.
And that's something you don't worry about with object hoarding, except the intent that they view losing a loved object as being equivalent to killing it or having it die.
