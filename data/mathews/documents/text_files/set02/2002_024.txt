Rebecca: Right, kind of to take that one step further, how would you use this criteria in like an adolescent or a child who's space is being actively managed and controlled by somebody else?
Interviewee: Yeah, I find that really tricky and, to be fair, I don't actually assess or diagnose many kids with hoarding, but it is something that encouraged me and it has happened more with our Uni students, which is something that I do deal with regularly, is how do you figure out what would happen if the external constraints were removed? And again, that's where I go a bit with the distress criterion, because I think if it's because of the parents being or the roommates being contained to one area, but the person is still struggling on a daily basis with their buying things that they don't need or that they're feeling upset about how much of their personal space has been taken over, or getting into fights. A lot of it is conflict because maybe their mom or dad is saying, "You need to throw away a couple of these books, you now have 400, and they're crying saying, "No, I can't" I think at that point, I would probably say it's a problem, it's a disorder because it's causing so much distress and conflict and yes it isn't causing interference because it's being contained by those external pressures, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a problem and it wouldn't be a really important thing to intervene now.
