Interviewer: So now I’m going to go through a little bit of the criteria more specifically.
So one of the criteria, as I’m sure you know, reads “persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value” and I wonder if for you that valuation or the inappropriateness of the valuation of objects is a part of the diagnosis.
So is it that they are unable to judge an object’s value?
Is that a part of this diagnostic criteria?
Interviewee: No, no I don’t think so.
The reason that that was put in is because the original criteria, the clinical criteria that [NAME] developed ten years prior to that was kind of used.
Most research studies said that there was persistent difficulty discarding of items that most people would consider worthless and many people with hoarding disorder have clutter that really consists of stuff that they bought that actually has a lot of financial value.
So expensive clothes, stuff that they bought online but in excess quantities.
So if you applied the old criteria that stuff wouldn’t be considered worthless or of low value, actually it was pretty valuable stuff.
So that’s why that little clause was put in, “regardless of actual value,” because sometimes people have homes filled with highly valuable, expensive stuff.
That was the reason for that.
