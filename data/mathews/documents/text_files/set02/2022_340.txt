Rebecca: Do you see, and this is of particular interest to me, but do you see kind of cultural values relating to the proper way to own items or dispose of them or maybe forces associating value and self-worth with ownership and material goods, do you see them as related? And maybe one example may be people who save things because they're worried about the environment. Do you feel like those reasons that people give to save are reflections of those kinds of, maybe like larger ideas about the place of items in the world and the things that can happen with them? I don't know, that was a very vague question.
Interviewee: Yeah no, I see them. Certainly my social work and sociology training, I see them as intricately connected. I think, and again I think we haven't scratched the surface here, but I think it ranges from personal values and cultural elements across the cultural and societal levels. So, I sort of see that PCS model. I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding? Would the phenomenon even have roots, because it couldn't manifest in the same ways? So, I think yeah I think there's a whole pile of questions and no answers in that category, but I certainly see culture and society as being deeply influential around this problem.
