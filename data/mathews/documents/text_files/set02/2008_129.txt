Interviewer2: Yeah okay um so just the last part of that question was just to have you think through and this is just a useful exercise because it makes it very concrete um to think through a specific case or cases that was challenging for you to diagnose either clinically or in research because it was on the border between pathological and non pathological behavior um perhaps it was almost sub-clinical or for other reasons perhaps it was it was similar to another mental health disorder and on that border or again you give the example of one you don’t have cluttered house but you know had clutter in storage spaces so could you think of a specific case that was challenging for any of those reason and kind of talk through how you end up making the decision
Interviewee: Yeah sure I mean that the um if you hadn’t asked me about a specific case and just asked me what do I think is the biggest problem with the diagnostic criteria um for me it comes down to two things the first is the clutter criterion um I think the clutter criterion is fascination because it's almost like if we were to translate that to like OCD for example it would be like saying ‘let me see your hands are they bloody enough?
Okay they are you have OCD’ and that’s not at all how we would diagnose OCD right?
Interviewer2: Right right
