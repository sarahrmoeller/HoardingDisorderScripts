Rebecca: Do you give any kind of credence to the idea that being the response to trauma or as some patients might say the need to save because of poverty or anything like that? 
Interviewee: The trauma explanation, no. The other explanation, I…that you mentioned saving because they grew up poor or something, to me that’s environmental, so there’s always an environmental component to that. That could be part of why someone behaves this way. But most people exposed to poverty and, you know, who don’t have much growing up they don’t behave this way, so there’s obviously something different about the person who develops hoarding from that background. And to me, that’s probably a genetic component that predisposes them.
Rebecca: Ok. Have you ever encountered a child who you would characterize as a hoarder or a person under the age of eighteen?
Interviewee: I can’t think of any but I’m not a child psychiatrist.
Rebecca: Ok. Well, I really appreciate your time today and helping me think through these issues and participating in this study. To let you know what the next steps will be as I mentioned: we’re transcribing these interviews and the team is conducting interviews for the next I think two months with the clinical experts, and we’re hoping to be able to report our findings and to report on kind of the general state of knowledge of this field shortly. And then the second phase of the project, we’re going to be interviewing people with this disorder to see how their views align to try to understand how that might affect their adherence to treatment and their desire to seek treatment. Um so I really appreciate your time today. Do you have any questions for me about what we’re doing or anything I can answer?
Interviewee: No, not at all.
Rebecca: I really appreciate your patience; I apologize for uh…
Interviewee: Ok. Yeah, you’re welcome.
Rebecca: Thank you very much.
Interviewee: Ok. Bye now.
Rebecca: Bye.
