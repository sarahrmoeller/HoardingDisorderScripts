Rebecca: With your patients who are object hoarders, do you feel like there is an impact of kind of increased national dialogue of climate change and environmentalism on their behavior or the way they talk about their behavior? So do you have people who say, "I can't discard because there's too much trash in the world and this will end up in a landfill or in the ocean."
Interviewee: I see that it hearkens back to a question you asked earlier about which drives which, and a belief driving the behavior or the belief being applied later. I see that as an example of a reason acquired later. I remember when I first started learning to treat OCD, it was in the late 80s and early 90s and HIV was a very big threat. And it seemed like every patient came in and the contamination fears were always about HIV. I feel it's more like that.
Rebecca: So that's kind of like a disorder picking up a sort of characteristic fear or anxiety that is circulating societally, and is just manifesting in that way.
Interviewee: Yeah, it goes back to that dying person. Dying people don't care about the environment, I should care about the environment, so I'm gonna be responsible with this VCR.
Rebecca: Have you seen an increase in people who endorse those kind of environmentalist beliefs? Maybe in the past couple of year as compared to before that?
Interviewee: I'd say the only way I've seen an increase in that is related to perfectionism around recycling. We do a lot of recycling, so it's actually pretty easy to recycle most things but that last 10% of things is hard to recycle. But because we recycle 90%, when you get plastics that actually don't fit what is taken out in the weekly recycling, that's why I see that.
Rebecca: Well I really appreciate your time today, that's all the questions that I had for you and I have very much enjoyed your extremely thoughtful responses, so thank you so much for your time.
