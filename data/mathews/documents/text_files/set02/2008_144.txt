P2: Okay um well that the bulk of our interview right there um we just wanted to kind of close out with a very broad kind of general question um what you think that the biggest things that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder are or uh if you could answer one question about hoarding disorder which one would you pick where you think the most important research could be 
Interviewee: Oh my god um I’ll be here forever if I answer that but I really don’t know I think it's so fascinating its like you know I started studying it almost by accident back in like you know early 2000’s and here I am still looking at it um I think that the most important that thing we can do in navigating hoarding research in moving forward is getting out of the mindset of this being an OC spectrum disorder um I think that it hoarding has grown up so much um from with in the shadow of of OCD that is has shaped a lot of how we conceptualize this condition and how we conceptualize the symptoms and the INAUDIBLE (1:49:40)  and the validity everything an the more that we are learning about hoarding the more I think that we need to stop doing that it is almost like this perfect storm disorder where you get you know high levels of depression high levels of anxiety you have these personality features you have executive function deficits you have like everything um and it just I think that part of the reason why it's so challenging um yeah but so I I don’t make me pick one answer (laughing)
P1: Okay 
P2: Okay that’s that’s fair um and we talked about a lot of different issues too over the course of this interview um I really appreciate your time and and um this was just really a great interview and um I think that a lot of the things that you have it was great and um validity and wonderful to have you kind of predict the questions that we were going to ask because I think that uh we’re interested in uh the same kind of questions in terms of insight and in terms of how the diagnostic criteria are applied um I don’t know if you want to talk now about next steps for us um or if 
Interviewee: I mean I think 
P2: Want to think about it 
Interviewee: I think that um so so where I'm at right is that if there’s a role for me as a your collaborator or you know more lose consultant um I'm I I certainly think that this is really important and have been wanting to do something along these lines for for a while so I'm game but I but also so you guys are also at a point of study where maybe you don’t really need any more cooks in the kitchen that’s perfectly okay and we could re-circle you know once you know maybe um that fact that maybe you could use some these interviews to really develop a larger survey um to you know kind of think about interviewing different types of folks not just experts but the people who are actually because there are such few experts so who are the people who are interacting with these patients on a daily basis? um we can always revisit this at that time
