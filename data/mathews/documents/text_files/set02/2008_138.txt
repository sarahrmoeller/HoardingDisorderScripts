P2: Yeah I think that’s a really interesting too um so if you just to kind of return to the questions we skipped sorry about that NAME (1:27:33) kind jumping all over the place um so if you were to think about your conversations with patients um how would you how do you try to help a patient gain insight or how do you try to help patients recognize things about this concept of insight that might be able to recognize in treatment what do you say to um to get them there?
Interviewee: Well one of the things that I think about a lot to capitalize on where they’re at so there was something well let me backup I take a very MI approach to this so that’s probably the simplest way to answer that so you you kind of roll with the resistance but you try to them really flesh out um their potential reasons for change the potential barriers to change and and the ultimate hope would be you are going to kind of increase this readiness for change kind of like mental preparedness for change um but I I really keep that in mind throughout treatment with hoarding patients because there are going to be weeks where whatever it is that you are sorting is going to be sorting is going to um it it's just going to be tougher and so maybe you're just going to have more of a challenge that week than than others so just kind of rolling with that resistance and helping the patient can navigate that um an making it okay that you understand um you know similar to someone one with subs abuse there’s a reason why they are using there’s a reason why our patients are saving their stuff and those reasons aren’t bad
P2: Mhm 
Interviewee: The behavior the result is not helpful but the reason behind right it we shouldn’t necessarily judge 
P2: Ham interesting and just to kind of carry that a step further um one thing that we heard from some other clinician is that um by the time the patients come to them they already they kind of by definition already have some insight as to what’s going on so if you can just think through in your experience what that process before patients you know  are necessarily self identifying as hoarders or are coming in for studies or treatment what that process of gaining insight on their own has looked like for your patients 
Interviewee: Yeah you know the person who INAUDIBLE (1:30:12) 
P2: INAUDIBLE (1:30:13)
