Interviewer: Do you ever feel that there is a borderline or a difficult with hoarding disorder in other co-morbid disorders? So, do you ever have difficulty telling if somebody is truly depressed or perhaps has a sense of compulsive disorder, versus they truly have hoarding disorder?
Interviewee: Yes, I do see that but because I do treatment in the field, regardless of whatever they're struggling with, a lot of the treatment for the actual trouble with the items is the same. So, I'll be working with them, you know if they have other issues going on, you know working with their anxiety but then working with their hoarding problem the same way as I would with anybody.
Interviewer: And do you feel like there's maybe some overlap also that might make it difficult in conditions where the person is extremely impoverished or is saving things because they might actually need to sell them or they might be keeping them, you know, keeping things that people might normally not keep but because of the socioeconomic position the person's living in they're saving them? Or do you not have that difficulty?
Interviewee: Yeah, I do have that difficulty but usually what I've found in the past is that'll be something the client will say, but when explored a little bit further, like you know, "I have to keep this because I can't afford to get another one, or "I can't afford to replace it if I need it, this other item that's similar will break," but often when I look at it further with them, it's more about like you know their difficulty with discarding, not because they need to hold onto some things for financial reasons. That's just kind of --
Interviewer: It's a justification rather than a real thing.
Interviewee: Yeah exactly, a justification. So, you know if you have 5 of something you only maybe need 2 of at the most, but that is a reason a lot of my clients use.
