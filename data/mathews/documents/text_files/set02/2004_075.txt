Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that’ll be interesting. I’m probably going to be doing a simple study pf my telephone messages, and maybe generating a group of people to call my phone and leave a message, because I know that what happens is people with hoarding disorder will take more time to express an idea, because it’s so filled with detail and irrelevant detail compared to other people. And that I think speaks partly to the information processing problem that these folks have, and maybe speaks to the way in which the brain is wired, it’s this ‘too many branches’ idea.
Interviewer 2: Mhm. Ok, well I really appreciate your time, and [NAME 44:05] do you have anything else before we wrap up?
Interviewer 1: Yeah, no. I don’t think I have anything else. We would just… yeah, like you mentioned, we really appreciated the opportunity to get back in touch with you at some point in the future as we move forward in the process of developing and maybe piloting that patient interview. 
Interviewee: Sure, I’ll be happy to do that. I’m pretty much flat out until June, so I wouldn’t be able to do anything before June. Just keep that in mind, I don’t know how quickly you’re moving.
Interviewer 2: [inaudible 44:35]
Interviewee: Ok, well good luck!
Interviewer 1: Thank you.
Interviewer 2: Thank you, so much.
Interviewee: I’ll talk to you later.
Interviewer 1: Bye.
Interviewer 2: Take care, bye.
