Interview 001
Rebecca: So, one thing that I ask clinical experts about object hoarding, which I wonder since you're somebody who knows a lot about both disorders, so when we talk about insight there's a lot of different constructs of insight that we can talk about. Randy Frost had a paper where he broke it down into four, and the four are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness or that something is wrong, overvalued ideation; so, persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items for object hoarders or animals, and indifference. And one of the things that I wonder about is is it a delusional disorder, like--
Interviewee: It's very interesting you bring that up because I was just this morning at a meeting at the association of prosecuting attorneys working with a judge who I've worked with on a number of hoarding cases, and she just had a case of a client who was charged with animal hoarding, I forget all the details but I believe it was quite a few dogs--more than 30--but he was found not competent based on a delusion. It was argued, and we've never had this before in an animal hoarding case, but because he was in such denial. He otherwise was aware of the proceedings, aware of the charges against him, normally might have been considered competent to participate in his own defense, but because he could not acknowledge that the animals in his care were suffering or were dying, the court considered him to be delusional, that he's otherwise functioning at a very high level but his total failure to recognize the impact of his behavior on the animals was in the court's view indicative of delusional functioning, and basically he was found not competent to stand trial and actually has been admitted to a mental health facility at least temporarily. So, we had a lot of discussion for probably about half an hour with a bunch of prosecutors because this was a first in terms of my dealing with hoarding situations where not only was it recognized as delusional thinking, but so delusional that an otherwise high-functioning person interfered with his ability to assist in his own defense.
