Interviewer2: And is that because the behavior of depression might cause someone to accumulate things or be unable to clean [INAUDIBLE]?
Interviewee: Yeah, I think just the behavioral activation [INAUDIBLE].
Is it the lethargy and the low self-esteem and the feeling not deserving of living in a cleaner space and kind of an apathy about the living environment as well.
Interviewer1: Mhm, that makes total sense, yeah.
Ok, I can understand that.
Ok, now we’re going to ask you some questions about the DSM 5 criteria specifically, so we’ll read you one of the criteria and then ask you some questions about how you apply them.
So, the first criteria is consistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value.
And, we’re kind of wondering how different clinicians might determine that term “actual value.”
What makes the value judgement for a person with hoarding disorder inappropriate?
Interviewee: I think it’s more… I mean one of the challenges I feel here is when I ask somebody, and this is like a fire marshal, “How do you know if it’s a hoarding disorder situation?” He’s like, “Well it’s like porn, you know it when you see it.”
That’s not helpful because it’s such a subjective evaluation.
How do you attach value to something?
I feel it’s incredibly subjective as well because, so it may not be the value attached with one individual item, but is this a pattern I see repeated across multiple items?
As compared to the value that might be determined by my own subjective standard of the items compared to how something might sell on EBay.
But, I think it’s more… is the individual… how much are they trying to explain or justify the value that they attach to the item?
Interviewer2: So, it sounds like you make the determination less about each item and more about the pattern of items.
Interviewee: Yeah.
