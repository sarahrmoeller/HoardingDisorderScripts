Interviewee: I don’t I don’t the hoarding depression distinctions that difficult I think that’s pretty easy um but the one that I think does get a little bit tricky is if they have OCD and hoarding um and being able to like tease apart which hoarding behavior is linked to OCD verses what is linked to hoarding disorder I think that gets a little bit tricky
P1: We had a participant like that yesterday actually INAUDIBLE  that you mentioned that it is very challenging
Interviewee: Yeah interesting mhm
P2: Mhm INAUDIBLE
Interviewee: INAUDIBLE  What I say to my students is that if you go back to why are they saving?
why are they attached to the objects?
then I think it becomes a little clearer it just depends on how much insight the patient has give you answers to that if it comes down to they just like their stuff LAUGHING you know then it's pretty clear its hoarding
P2: Um mhm NAME  do you want to move into the DSM five questions?
P1: Yeah okay
P2: INAUDIBLE
P1: Yeah exactly so you had brought up the DSM five criteria and we actually have some specific questions that we want to ask you about the specific elements in the DSM five criterion and how you imply them and employ them in your practice and your research so uh the first phrase that we wanted to mention was persistent difficulty discarding or parting possession regardless of their values and so with this we kind of wanted to get you how you’re deeming value and what makes the values judgment a hoarding patient makes inappropriate?
Interviewee: Um I mean so the way that we usually first we always ask if they have any difficulties with discarding um objects or belongings and if the person says yes to that we always ask for examples um what are the types of things you have difficulties discarding and um if someone were to say my Faberge eggs or LAUGHING I don’t know whatever my you know my eighteen hundreds stamp collection um then we would ask the follow up question are there any other types of objects you have a hard time letting go of um so I thick there is a very obvious aspect of value that has to do with just in general with most people think that that something you should hang on to um and and if not then I kind of seeing how extensive it is like are there multiple objects um I think that’s really kind of the crux its not only that they have a hard time discarding um baggies for or the only have a hard time discarding take out containers like a hoarding patient has difficulties discarding a range of objects and again that threshold for how many of these objects they have is tends to be a lot higher then yes I sometimes save takeout containers as well but I have maybe like two of them versus you know so many that you have this cluttered living space
P2: Mhm
