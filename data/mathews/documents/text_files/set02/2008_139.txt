Interviewee: Definitely talk to is NAME  and I'm goanna if you haven’t already reached out to NAME  I'm going to send you his email um NAME  runs the housing up in CITY  and NAME  has I think really different insight because he’s reaching patients through the department of housing before they self identify um and so I think that his perspective about you know how does insight and motivation for treatment how does that all play out is is really different from those of us who are kind of in a little bit more um I don’t know uh elitist type of treatment programs right where by the time somebody has called within the greater CITY  community they have found their way to the study of anxiety stress and OCD at the UNIVERSITY  I mean they absolutely already have some insight um now not everybody is ready for what it takes to do this treatment which is probably why I kind of have this unspoken rule that everybody has to do the facilitated self help group first and then they kind of work up to the CBT group and then they work up to the individual therapy um sometimes we break that rule but rarely and I think part of it is we have them do the self help group first to try to figure out ‘are you really ready for this?’ um do you have to have enough kind of motivation to kind of push through uh those tough times
P2: Mhm mhm and um I we’ll reach our reach out to you at the end of the interview for contact information that something we intended to do you listed and get names from you and I think you're right he would have a really different perspective on how patients

P2: Mhm
P1: Mhm
Interviewee: Yeah
P2: Okay um so NAME  want to move on to the next section?
P1: Yeah I think that the last question I had for you from the insight topic is uh when you're describing a patient with having low insight um what does that mean for you how are you defining insight?
Interviewee: Well I think it's basically what I you know what I kind of touched on before is that for low insight it would mean either there is an aspect that they cannot recognize right they’re like looking at the dead birds that they have collected and they’re like ‘they are happy and healthy’ like they do not recognize that they have a problem um that’s obviously an extreme example but but then it think that the other way I would define insight is this variable insight which would be more of that defensiveness the overvalued ideation and then the indifference piece like ‘what’s it to you that my house it cluttered?’ um I think clinicians constantly get in to trouble when we want to get them like to a one on the clutter image rating and they’re totally fine being at a four right like ‘what’s the big deal?’ um so yeah
