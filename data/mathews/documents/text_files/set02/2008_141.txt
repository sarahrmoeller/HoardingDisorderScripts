Interviewee: Yeah one thing where that’s different I think like the one exception for that is that we have a lot of patients that are really worried about like the environment and not wanting to be wasteful but its its not tied to the specific object but it's more because they have a really strong belief that to be good citizens of this world 
P2: And they might have more INAUDIBLE (1:38:14) something will happen if I let this object go 
Interviewee: Yeah
P1: Yeah okay um so now there’s another question that we kind of already discussed about uh postdoc reasons and um something else that you’ve already mentioned that is another question that we wanted to ask is do you think that cultural forces that associating back to values and self worth consumption and material possessions play any role in the development of hoarding disorder what kind of role do you think that plays?
Interviewee: Ah man I don’t know I don’t know I think it obviously has to be part of it and you know as the world is changing but you know hold on let me give you guys an example of why I always get stuck on this um I was speaking with a woman who just completed a stent with doctors without borders and so she's working in like rural Ethiopia and this woman came to her clinic and was um crying and really really upset and was like ‘nobody can help me with my husband’ um and and it’s the way that it works in that part of Ethiopia two level homes and basement the ground floor is where all the animals would stay at night so all the goats and what not wouldn’t be picked off by wild animals um so then the family lives up on the second level and so with one woman went on to describe the fact that her husband is collecting all sorts of like containers and like extra clothing pieces and potential building supplies and like all of this stuff that when it was described to me sounds sure a lot like what my patients tend to acquire um and collect and save um and and he basically filed the entire bottom level of their home and so the reason she was upset was that they had already had like three of their goats killed because they were no longer within the protection of the of the home and so is is because of materialism? When you obviously have to have access to stuff right so but we live in a world where even if your on like a deserted island you could start to collect coconut shells or whatever I don’t know I I don’t know I don’t know not a concrete answer but I think that’s the big question that we have
