P1: And do you currently uh see patients with hoarding disorder or are you just conducting research?
Interviewee: So we’re uh its bazaar in uh in the world of clinical psych especially if your associated with a university in STATE  it’s the same way for other states as well but but um STATE  in particular I don’t actually have to be licensed LAUGHING so I personally do not see patients but within our group I mention to you we do my lab focuses um on risk and vulnerability across anxiety OC spectrum um so some of the work we do is looking at trans diagnosis risk factors um some of the work we do is focused on OCD and then probably a a third to a half of the work we do is focused on all things hoarding so as result of that um it’s a real conundrum down down here and considering how big of a city CITY  is um it's always shocking to me I mean I can barely find treatment provides for anxiety and OCD so for forget hoarding like there really isn’t anyone else um who does anything remotely helpful for these patients um and I'm not being a snotty academic uh who is over stating the reality of it it's really like tough down here so as a result of that we um do have on going groups that we provided which I then supervise and so that how I still have a lot of contact with patients um we do the facilitated self help group and then we do group therapy for hoarding patients um and then so that’s more CBT focused group therapy and then we also do individual therapy for hoarding patients
P1: Okay
P2: Okay
Interviewee: Again a long answer sorry guys
P2: Yeah no that’s okay um so just to kind of get started thinking of the issues in our interview and we’ve already talked a little about this but just to get us thinking about um about how clinicians think about hoarding right now and how you as a clinicians think about it the first question that we like to ask you related to related to this topic is just to have you talk through what the most important differences between normal saving behavior such as perhaps collecting and hoarding disorder are
