But, yeah low confidence in memory I think is a big one as opposed to a memory deficit itself. 
Rebecca: Okay, our final question is extremely broad, and I’m sure that we could probably talk for an hour just about this one. But if you were to say what you think the biggest things are that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder or the biggest unanswered questions in your mind? And again, that’s a very big question but.
Interviewee: Yeah. All of it?
Rebecca: Okay.
Interviewee: Literally we don’t know anything about hoarding.
Well I take that back. We don’t know nothing, but we know very little. I still don’t think we’ve understood what causes hoarding disorder. I mean we know what some of the correlates are, but I think we are a long way from understanding what kinds of things actually make hoarding disorder occur. And I think when it comes to treatment you know we’ve got a treatment that’s only about half way good and still doesn’t result in remission for most of the patients that receive it. So, I think that the other big piece is we need to understand what kind of treatments might be more affective then what we currently have. 
Rebecca: Okay those are some big questions to answer in the future.
Interviewee: Yes.
Rebecca: Well I really appreciate your time. That’s all the questions that I have for you today. 
Interviewee: Sure, my pleasure.
