Do I know someone that has a use for it now? Might I have a use for it in the near future? Might I know someone who will have a use for it in the near future? Um, is it something that I can uh, realize um, financial reward for? In other words, is it something that’s sellable that someone else might have a use for and I can get rid of it by selling it to Craigslist, or is it something that um, has an appropriate place to be donated to, like um, the [place; (19:21)] or the [place; (19:24)] or whatever, where some of my stuff periodically makes its way to? Or, um, again, is it just something that holds sentimental value to me or is perceived by me to potentially hold sentimental value to someone else. So again, when you retain things from people that have moved on to a different plane of existence and it’s, you know,  antique-kinda stuff that’s interesting or intriguing or whatever, I hate to just toss it in the garbage even though it has no apparent use to me at this point in time.
