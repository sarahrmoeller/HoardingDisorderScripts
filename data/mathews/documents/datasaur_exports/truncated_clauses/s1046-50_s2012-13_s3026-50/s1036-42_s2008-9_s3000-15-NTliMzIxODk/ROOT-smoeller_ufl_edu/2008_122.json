they also have a little more of a feeling like somebody with a personality disorder and I don’t I don’t mean that in like a negative kind of stigma way that people sometimes take that what I mean is there is just to something about its really unique about these patients is that whole issue of wanting and maintaining control um and and that’s where you know I joke we do we run groups down here and more as a service to the community because there’s nobody else who provides treatment for hoarding in CITY (33:15) and um and just because I’m I don’t have that much personnel down here and so I I've trained some of our senior undergraduate students to help kind of facilitate these groups and hoarding patients love them and I always joke about the fact that they love them more than they love talking to me talking to be the quote on quote hoarding expert um and theses this aspect where they feel like their contributing to that students educations and that then directly feeds back to their
