genesis of this project is the problem of insight and the problem that you have a lot of patients with hoarding disorder who, you know, if you think about the kind of stereotypical example of a hoarding patient with low insight, has a house that's completely hoarded out, that's completely filled with stuff, lives fairly socially isolated, and until there's an external source of pressure, is happy living that way, at least in their own mind; so, they're not seeking treatment.","tokens":["The","genesis","of","this","project","is","the","problem","of","insight","and","the","problem","that","you","have","a","lot","of","patients","with","hoarding","disorder","who,","you","know,","if","you","think","about","the","kind","of","stereotypical","example","of","a","hoarding","patient","with","low","insight,","has","a","house","that's","completely","hoarded","out,","that's","completely","filled","with","stuff,","lives","fairly","socially","isolated,","and","until","there's","an","external","source","of","pressure,","is","happy","living","that","way,","at","least","in","their","own","mind;","so,","they're","not","seeking","treatment."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"So,

for me I'm perfectly happy that the distress they come in with is, \"I'm going to be evicted, people are yelling at me, my sister's trying to make me throw out my stuff\" is hoarding related, but
