question because you're not, so with object hoarding as well there is this sense even among clinicians of the best way to know if somebody is a hoarder is to look at how much stuff they have, and it's striking to me that there really aren't other disorders in general where you would diagnose a person by looking at something external to them, how much they've accumulated and you point out the
