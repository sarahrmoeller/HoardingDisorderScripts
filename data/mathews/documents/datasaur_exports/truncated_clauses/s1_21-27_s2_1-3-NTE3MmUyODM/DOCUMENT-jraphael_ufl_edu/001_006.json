So perhaps the reason we could speculate--and cut me off if you think that this is wrong--but we could speculate that maybe part of the reason that the rate of recidivism tends to be so high with animal hoarding and insight tends to be so low, while it is in object hoarding I think it's uniquely low in animal hoarding, could perhaps be because it requires so much more investment in terms of keeping the animals, so much more investment in the beliefs about the animals and also the animals kind of give back more than objects.","tokens":["Rebecca:","So","perhaps","the","reason","we","could","speculate--and","cut","me","off","if","you","think","that","this","is","wrong--but","we","could","speculate","that","maybe","part","of","the","reason","that","the","rate","of","recidivism","tends","to","be","so","high","with","animal","hoarding","and","insight","tends","to","be","so","low,","while","it","is","in","object","hoarding","I","think","it's","uniquely","low","in","animal","hoarding,","could","perhaps","be","because","it","requires","so","much","more","investment","in","terms","of","keeping","the","animals,","so","much","more","investment","in","the","beliefs","about","the","animals","and","also","the","animals","kind","of","give","back","more","than","objects."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee:
