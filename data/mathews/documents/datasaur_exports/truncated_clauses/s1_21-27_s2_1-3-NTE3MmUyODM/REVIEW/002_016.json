to generate these lists, and I think that they're just interpreting the question differently, I don't think that this is a difference in understanding, but it's very interesting to me nonetheless, they give a list of what a person with hoarding disorder would look like, like what are some other characteristics of that person apart from their hoarding.","tokens":["Another","interesting","thing","that","has","happened","with","this","list,","I","gave","you","the","list","of","\"How","would","you","know","that","somebody","has","hoarding","disorder?\"","And","some","clinicians","take","it","the","way","you","did","where","it","was","like,","\"How","would","I","diagnose","a","person","and","know","if","they","came","in","my","office?\"","But","some","clinicians","have","started","to","generate","these","lists,","and","I","think","that","they're","just","interpreting","the","question","differently,","I","don't","think","that","this","is","a","difference","in","understanding,","but","it's","very","interesting","to","me","nonetheless,","they","give","a","list","of","what","a","person","with","hoarding","disorder","would","look","like,","like","what","are","some","other","characteristics","of","that","person","apart","from","their","hoarding."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee:
