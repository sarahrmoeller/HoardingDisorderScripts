You know, I don't think--it's an interesting question because as a practical measure in how we respond it clearly is different, it requires different resources to address in terms of the underlying

in animal hoarding?\" And the cases are few and far between enough in any one jurisdiction that you don't necessarily get a specialist like that, and usually what I say is we'll find someone who is familiar with dealing with hoarding disorder in general, and if they don't already know some of the other peculiarities associated with animal hoarding, we can certainly give them some of the background resources that will help improve their ability to better understand that, but I don't know that we need to treat it totally differently.","tokens":["The","question","I","get","a","lot","sometimes","is","if","there","is","going","to","be","a","referral","of","an","animal","hoarder","to","a","mental","health","professional,","the","court","might","often","ask,","\"Can","you","refer","me","to","someone","who","is","a","specialist","in","animal","hoarding?\"","And","the","cases","are","few","and","far","between","enough","in","any","one","jurisdiction","that","you","don't","necessarily","get","a","specialist","like","that,","and","usually","what","I","say","is","we'll","find","someone","who","is","familiar","with","dealing","with","hoarding","disorder","in","general,","and","if","they","don't","already","know","some","of","the","other","peculiarities","associated","with","animal","hoarding,","we","can","certainly","give","them","some","of","the","background","resources","that","will","help","improve","their","ability","to","better","understand","that,","but","I","don't","know","that","we","need","to","treat","it","totally","differently."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca:
