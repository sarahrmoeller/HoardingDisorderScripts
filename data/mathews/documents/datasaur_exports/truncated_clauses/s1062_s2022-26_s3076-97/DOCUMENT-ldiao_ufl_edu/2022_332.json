You know like, \"I'll read all of these books someday, I might need it sometime, I'm afraid I'll forget\" it didn't seem to sound like OCD but there were no physical objects in sight.

In the absence of saving other objects, I'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. For me, the times that I have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly. One case that I can think of, yeah so I don't think strictly it would been the criteria because it wouldn't meet that interference piece, but if it were in the context of other things, perhaps.","tokens":["Interviewee:","Um,","you","know","it","would","be...I've","had","similar","cases,","perhaps","even","a","bit","more","extreme","where","there","were","multiple","screens","and","a","person","was","kind","of","unable","to,","they","had","to","constantly","kind","of","monitor","things","and","then","back","in","the","day","of","VHS","tapes","and","those","kinds","of","things,","the","accumulation","of","that","kind","of","technology,","VCRs","and","things","which","generally","speaking","does","take","up","quite","a","lot","less","space.","In","the","absence","of","saving","other","objects,","I'm","not","sure","that","that","alone","would","meet","criteria","because","it","doesn't","fully","meet","the","criteria","for","the","accumulation","causing","interference.","For","me,","the","times","that","I","have","seen","that","kind","of","digital","accumulation,","it's","always","also","been","in","the","context","of","saving","of","other","items","and/or","animals,","sadly.","One","case","that","I","can","think","of,","yeah","so","I","don't","think","strictly","it","would","been","the","criteria","because","it","wouldn't","meet","that","interference","piece,","but","if","it","were","in","the","context","of","other","things,","perhaps."],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":7767,"email":"ldiao@ufl.edu","displayName":"Diao, Lauren V."},"labelSets":[{"name":"HD tagset","index":0,"labelItems":[{"id":"zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r","labelName":"Incomplete Thought","parentId":null,"color":"#ffc826"},{"id":"CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R","labelName":"Self Correction","parentId":null,"color":"#33cc99"},{"id":"yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb","labelName":"Clarification","parentId":null,"color":"#3370cc"},{"id":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelName":"Generic Disfluency","parentId":null,"color":"#ff8000"},{"id":"zNhzFxWreupeViuWpVQbm","labelName":"Misspeak","parentId":null,"color":"#df3920"},{"id":"nmDmE8yCiIjn1v0WJrgTj","labelName":"Unclear","parentId":null,"color":null},{"id":"VBS0Kk5Mwre1tPCapxA3k","labelName":"Overlap","parentId":null,"color":"#9933cc"}],"leafOnlyOption":false}],"spanLabels":[],"arrowLabels":[],"boundingBoxLabels":[],"timeLabels":[],"comments":[],"url":"datasaur://static/7436/cb15aea0-11c8-41de-9a37-2438ad174498.txt","rowAnswers":[],"documentAnswers":[]}}
