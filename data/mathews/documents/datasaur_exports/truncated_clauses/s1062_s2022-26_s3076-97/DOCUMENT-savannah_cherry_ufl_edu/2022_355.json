They remember childhood and having some behaviors, but it hasn't gotten to the point where it's been a problem or that they've recognized or someone else has noticed as being a problem. Usually they can tell me about some big event that happened like loss of their family and they've inherited some things and they've ended up having so many things that it became overwhelming and they just kind of gave up on managing it. So, usually they've been managing it, you know they've always had a little bit too much stuff but something has prompted them to stop managing it, and then it became out of control like a health issue, or caring for a family member, or loss of the family member, some big event. It's not always like that, but generally they talk about having these behaviors for like their life.","tokens":["Interviewee:","Well","on","average","from","my","experience,","they've","had","these","saving","behaviors,","the","difficulty","discarding","for","a","long","long","period","of","time,","probably","as","long","as","they","can","remember.","They","remember","childhood","and","having","some","behaviors,","but","it","hasn't","gotten","to","the","point","where","it's","been","a","problem","or","that","they've","recognized","or","someone","else","has","noticed","as","being","a","problem.","Usually","they","can","tell","me","about","some","big","event","that","happened","like","loss","of","their","family","and","they've","inherited","some","things","and","they've","ended","up","having","so","many","things","that","it","became","overwhelming","and","they","just","kind","of","gave","up","on","managing","it.","So,","usually","they've","been","managing","it,","you","know","they've","always","had","a","little","bit","too","much","stuff","but","something","has","prompted","them","to","stop","managing","it,","and","then","it","became","out","of","control","like","a","health","issue,","or","caring","for","a","family","member,","or","loss","of","the","family","member,","some","big","event.","It's","not","always","like","that,","but","generally","they","talk","about","having","these","behaviors","for","like","their","life."],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":7649,"email":"savannah.cherry@ufl.edu","displayName":"Cherry, Savannah G."},"labelSets":[{"name":"HD tagset","index":0,"labelItems":[{"id":"zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r","labelName":"Incomplete Thought","parentId":null,"color":"#ffc826"},{"id":"CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R","labelName":"Self Correction","parentId":null,"color":"#33cc99"},{"id":"yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb","labelName":"Clarification","parentId":null,"color":"#3370cc"},{"id":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelName":"Generic Disfluency","parentId":null,"color":"#ff8000"},{"id":"zNhzFxWreupeViuWpVQbm","labelName":"Misspeak","parentId":null,"color":"#df3920"},{"id":"nmDmE8yCiIjn1v0WJrgTj","labelName":"Unclear","parentId":null,"color":null},{"id":"VBS0Kk5Mwre1tPCapxA3k","labelName":"Overlap","parentId":null,"color":"#9933cc"}],"leafOnlyOption":false}],"spanLabels":[{"id":"1702710916","labelSetIndex":0,"labeledBy":"LABELER","labeledByUserId":7649,"acceptedByUserId":1010,"rejectedByUserId":null,"layer":0,"counter":0,"status":"ACCEPTED","hashCode":"SPAN:yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb:0:0:0:1:0:0:0:6:2:0:undefined:undefined","labelName":"yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb","labelItem":{"id":"yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb","labelName":"Clarification","parentId":null,"color":"#3370cc"},"textPosition":{"start":{"row":0,"column":0,"tokenIndex":1,"charIndex":0},"end":{"row":0,"column":0,"tokenIndex":6,"charIndex":2}},"confidenceScore":null}],"arrowLabels":[],"boundingBoxLabels":[],"timeLabels":[],"comments":[],"url":"datasaur://static/7436/9a7ea3b6-e776-407e-841f-06116088243e.txt","rowAnswers":[],"documentAnswers":[]}}
