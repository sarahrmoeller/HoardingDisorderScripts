So the first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia, which is where you're unable to even perceive your illness or that anything is wrong or causing you distress, the third one is overvalued ideation, and that's kind of believing that your items are more valuable than they truly are, and the last one is indifference.

That's something we just see day in and day out, even from folks that are willing to work with us and I think a lot of it seems to come from the fear that we're not gonna understand their stuff or value their stuff and that we're gonna judge them. They know that the system overall can be very punitive, and so what we find is once we make it clear that we're not gonna take their stuff because that's not our role, or tell them what to do, that they have control of their stuff no matter what, the defensiveness seems to break down. A lot of it really seems to be very fear-based.\r","tokens":["Interviewee:","I","certainly","think","the","defensiveness","is","the","one","that","resonates","the","most.","That's","something","we","just","see","day","in","and","day","out,","even","from","folks","that","are","willing","to","work","with","us","and","I","think","a","lot","of","it","seems","to","come","from","the","fear","that","we're","not","gonna","understand","their","stuff","or","value","their","stuff","and","that","we're","gonna","judge","them.","They","know","that","the","system","overall","can","be","very","punitive,","and","so","what","we","find","is","once","we","make","it","clear","that","we're","not","gonna","take","their","stuff","because","that's","not","our","role,","or","tell","them","what","to","do,","that","they","have","control","of","their","stuff","no","matter","what,","the","defensiveness","seems","to","break","down.","A","lot","of","it","really","seems","to","be","very","fear-based."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: Um, when you encounter people who have this disorder and have very low insight, would you say that they truly don't know that there's anything different about them or their lives than other people?
