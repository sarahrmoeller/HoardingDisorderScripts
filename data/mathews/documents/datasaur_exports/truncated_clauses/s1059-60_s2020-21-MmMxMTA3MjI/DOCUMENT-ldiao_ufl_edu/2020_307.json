Do they describe it as starting at a certain point? And I guess the reason I'm asking this is hoarding is, as you I'm sure know, if more prevalent in elderly people and I've wondered is that because of the social factors? Is that because those people tend to be more isolated and perhaps living alone and they've had the impulse or the behavior their whole life and it only reaches clinical levels as they get older and less able to deal with it? Do you have any idea about that from your patients?\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","As","a","final","question,","I'm","wondering","if","you","have","any","idea","from","your","patients","and","conversations","with","them","how","long","their","behavior's","been","going","on","and","how","it","developed","over","the","course","of","their","life.","Do","they","describe","it","as","starting","at","a","certain","point?","And","I","guess","the","reason","I'm","asking","this","is","hoarding","is,","as","you","I'm","sure","know,","if","more","prevalent","in","elderly","people","and","I've","wondered","is","that","because","of","the","social","factors?","Is","that","because","those","people","tend","to","be","more","isolated","and","perhaps","living","alone","and","they've","had","the","impulse","or","the","behavior","their","whole","life","and","it","only","reaches","clinical","levels","as","they","get","older","and","less","able","to","deal","with","it?","Do","you","have","any","idea","about","that","from","your","patients?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: Yeah, so one thing I often talk about with my patients is differentiating between the difficulty they have in the way they relate to stuff, and the legacy in the years of accumulation, and I think there's inadequate weight given to that distinction. So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem.
