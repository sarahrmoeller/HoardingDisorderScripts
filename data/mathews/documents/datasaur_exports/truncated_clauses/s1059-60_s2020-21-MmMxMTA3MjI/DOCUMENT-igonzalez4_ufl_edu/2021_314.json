Before I ask you that, do you find that it's difficult to make the distinction between hoarding disorder and other mental health disorders that might result in accumulating items?

Or if it's unsafe because the person is trying to run bicycle track shop to feed their drug addiction. You know, it's different intervention.

And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I've seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn't hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row.
