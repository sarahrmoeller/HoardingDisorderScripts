But when you use that language to ask inner beauty, many of them would say, \"I don't know what other people look at.\" [laughs] So that's not good language, you can't use that one. But that's the way I see it, is in effort to say do you keep stuff that other people would get rid of? And I see that as thinking and being responsive to your space. Like do you keep stuff that other people would say, \"I'd rather have this space than this object in my life.\" And in terms of the paintings, how I would view that would depend on what else is in the home. Like if the paintings were the only thing in the home that was making someone think, \"Oh, this is hoarding\" then I might think it doesn't sound like hoarding to me.\r","tokens":["Interviewee:","Yeah,","regardless","of","their","actual","value,","I","think","that","they","attempt","to","try","to","say","things","that","other","people","would","get","rid","of.","But","when","you","use","that","language","to","ask","inner","beauty,","many","of","them","would","say,","\"I","don't","know","what","other","people","look","at.\"","[laughs]","So","that's","not","good","language,","you","can't","use","that","one.","But","that's","the","way","I","see","it,","is","in","effort","to","say","do","you","keep","stuff","that","other","people","would","get","rid","of?","And","I","see","that","as","thinking","and","being","responsive","to","your","space.","Like","do","you","keep","stuff","that","other","people","would","say,","\"I'd","rather","have","this","space","than","this","object","in","my","life.\"","And","in","terms","of","the","paintings,","how","I","would","view","that","would","depend","on","what","else","is","in","the","home.","Like","if","the","paintings","were","the","only","thing","in","the","home","that","was","making","someone","think,","\"Oh,","this","is","hoarding\"","then","I","might","think","it","doesn't","sound","like","hoarding","to","me."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: And is that because the person was only saving one sort of thing?\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","And","is","that","because","the","person","was","only","saving","one","sort","of","thing?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: Well that would make it certainly atypical for hoarding for sure.

I mean, or could you hoard, I guess I'm still struggling with that distinction.

It's also one of those things where there's this unspoken kind of social norms at play. Toothpaste caps are not commonly accepted as a collectible, art is. Even weird little things like things that have ducks on them, are recognized. It might not be something that I would want to collect, but people collect them. And hoarding involves a collection of things that don't, like I could see a guy who collected these age-old vitamin bottles because...I mean they were empty, he had eaten the vitamins out of them, but they don't make them the same way anymore. They've changed the style of bottle for this vitamin, so he saw that as a collection but I didn't see that as a collection. And [INAUDIBLE 47:56] why not [laughs], that's where I kind of in depth thinking well because society doesn't say it's a collection. \r","tokens":["Interviewee:","Yeah,","I","think","that's","a","really","good","thing","to","be","confused","about.","It's","also","one","of","those","things","where","there's","this","unspoken","kind","of","social","norms","at","play.","Toothpaste","caps","are","not","commonly","accepted","as","a","collectible,","art","is.","Even","weird","little","things","like","things","that","have","ducks","on","them,","are","recognized.","It","might","not","be","something","that","I","would","want","to","collect,","but","people","collect","them.","And","hoarding","involves","a","collection","of","things","that","don't,","like","I","could","see","a","guy","who","collected","these","age-old","vitamin","bottles","because...I","mean","they","were","empty,","he","had","eaten","the","vitamins","out","of","them,","but","they","don't","make","them","the","same","way","anymore.","They've","changed","the","style","of","bottle","for","this","vitamin,","so","he","saw","that","as","a","collection","but","I","didn't","see","that","as","a","collection.","And","[INAUDIBLE","47:56]","why","not","[laughs],","that's","where","I","kind","of","in","depth","thinking","well","because","society","doesn't","say","it's","a","collection."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: It's not a collectible.\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","It's","not","a","collectible."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: Yeah, a collectible or something that someone would say, \"Oh an expression of my personality is in this collection, you know because I love ducks.\" Or this is an investment of mine, I've become an expert on this thing, I'm now an art expert and I now have a good eye for this particular kind of thing.
