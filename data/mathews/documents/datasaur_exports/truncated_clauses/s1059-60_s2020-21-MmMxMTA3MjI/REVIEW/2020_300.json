It's interesting for that reason, and it's also interesting because you know different people can have different ideas on a normal spectrum of how much is too much. So, some people really like having clutter around, they feel better in a space that's more full of items than others, and we wouldn't think that that's strange, but it crosses a line with hoarding disorder in terms of safety and sometimes not with distress, sometimes with distress. So, I'm wondering again, like the beautiful example you gave of the man with his bespoke suits, would it be possible to have hoarding disorder with, for example, digital media? So, could somebody hoard emails and books online, and PDFs, and have just hard drives full of material and would that be a hoarder?\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","Sure,","and","you","know,","this","interview","isn't","an","effort","to","discredit","the","criteria,","it's","just","kind","of","an","effort","to","think","through","them","and","to","understand","kind","of","how","clinicians","are","applying","them.","It's","interesting","for","that","reason,","and","it's","also","interesting","because","you","know","different","people","can","have","different","ideas","on","a","normal","spectrum","of","how","much","is","too","much.","So,","some","people","really","like","having","clutter","around,","they","feel","better","in","a","space","that's","more","full","of","items","than","others,","and","we","wouldn't","think","that","that's","strange,","but","it","crosses","a","line","with","hoarding","disorder","in","terms","of","safety","and","sometimes","not","with","distress,","sometimes","with","distress.","So,","I'm","wondering","again,","like","the","beautiful","example","you","gave","of","the","man","with","his","bespoke","suits,","would","it","be","possible","to","have","hoarding","disorder","with,","for","example,","digital","media?","So,","could","somebody","hoard","emails","and","books","online,","and","PDFs,","and","have","just","hard","drives","full","of","material","and","would","that","be","a","hoarder?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: I've had trouble with that one. I mean, people ask about it, I've read about it myself, and I've had clients who do have problems with accumulating a lot of online material, far more than they could ever use, review, even access because it's not, they're not able to organize it appropriately anymore. But, I'm a little hard pressed, because if it were solely the digital media, I've not seen someone where it's solely digital accumulation without physical accumulation of other material. So, in those cases where I've seen the two coexisting, I would say that the electronic acquiring or accumulation is a feature of their hoarding difficulty. I guess I haven't been presented with a person who solely accumulates digitally and who would say their living circumstances physically are fine. I don't know what that would look like and how I would feel comfortable applying the diagnostic criteria, unless they were really distressed by their accumulation or reported spending too much time and effort, for example, on trying to catalog or organize it, I haven't read into that. But I think that if I heard somebody with that kind of description, where they've said, \"I myself am distressed by my electronic accumulation, I spend too much time acquiring electronic materials, I can't organize them to find what I want and it's troubling me and getting in the way because I'm spending so much effort on it,\" that would probably be them somebody I might end up diagnosing as an OCRD not otherwise specified kind of situation. But I've never seen one like that, so I don't know if those really exist. \r","tokens":["Interviewee:","I've","had","trouble","with","that","one.","I","mean,","people","ask","about","it,","I've","read","about","it","myself,","and","I've","had","clients","who","do","have","problems","with","accumulating","a","lot","of","online","material,","far","more","than","they","could","ever","use,","review,","even","access","because","it's","not,","they're","not","able","to","organize","it","appropriately","anymore.","But,","I'm","a","little","hard","pressed,","because","if","it","were","solely","the","digital","media,","I've","not","seen","someone","where","it's","solely","digital","accumulation","without","physical","accumulation","of","other","material.","So,","in","those","cases","where","I've","seen","the","two","coexisting,","I","would","say","that","the","electronic","acquiring","or","accumulation","is","a","feature","of","their","hoarding","difficulty.","I","guess","I","haven't","been","presented","with","a","person","who","solely","accumulates","digitally","and","who","would","say","their","living","circumstances","physically","are","fine.","I","don't","know","what","that","would","look","like","and","how","I","would","feel","comfortable","applying","the","diagnostic","criteria,","unless","they","were","really","distressed","by","their","accumulation","or","reported","spending","too","much","time","and","effort,","for","example,","on","trying","to","catalog","or","organize","it,","I","haven't","read","into","that.","But","I","think","that","if","I","heard","somebody","with","that","kind","of","description,","where","they've","said,","\"I","myself","am","distressed","by","my","electronic","accumulation,","I","spend","too","much","time","acquiring","electronic","materials,","I","can't","organize","them","to","find","what","I","want","and","it's","troubling","me","and","getting","in","the","way","because","I'm","spending","so","much","effort","on","it,\"","that","would","probably","be","them","somebody","I","might","end","up","diagnosing","as","an","OCRD","not","otherwise","specified","kind","of","situation.","But","I've","never","seen","one","like","that,","so","I","don't","know","if","those","really","exist."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: It's kind of along the lines of the collector example, where people may do that, but it's very rarely confined to one sphere like that.\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","It's","kind","of","along","the","lines","of","the","collector","example,","where","people","may","do","that,","but","it's","very","rarely","confined","to","one","sphere","like","that."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: Yeah.","tokens":["Interviewee:","Yeah."],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":7436,"email":"smoeller@ufl.edu","displayName":"Sarah Moeller"},"labelSets":[{"name":"HD tagset","index":0,"labelItems":[{"id":"zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r","labelName":"Incomplete Thought","parentId":null,"color":"#ffc826"},{"id":"CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R","labelName":"Self Correction","parentId":null,"color":"#33cc99"},{"id":"yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb","labelName":"Clarification","parentId":null,"color":"#3370cc"},{"id":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelName":"Generic Disfluency","parentId":null,"color":"#ff8000"},{"id":"zNhzFxWreupeViuWpVQbm","labelName":"Misspeak","parentId":null,"color":"#df3920"},{"id":"nmDmE8yCiIjn1v0WJrgTj","labelName":"Unclear","parentId":null,"color":null},{"id":"VBS0Kk5Mwre1tPCapxA3k","labelName":"Overlap","parentId":null,"color":"#9933cc"}],"leafOnlyOption":false}],"spanLabels":[],"arrowLabels":[],"boundingBoxLabels":[],"timeLabels":[],"comments":[],"url":"datasaur://static/7436/e7f49057-1e58-4df5-93ae-b9b20256b0e7.txt","rowAnswers":[],"documentAnswers":[]}}
