So the constructs that randy came up with are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness, overvalued ideation, so that would be more of a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items, or indifference. Um, and I'm wondering how you see these fitting together in people's insight. So, these are interesting to me because they are so varied. So, overvalued ideation or anosognosia even, sound almost more like a delusional disorder where you're looking at an item and you have an unreasonable belief that the item is more valuable than it is, or you're looking at your space and you think that your space looks normal, even though is objectively, you know no one with objectivity would see it as normal. Whereas defensiveness is much more based on behavior and indifference also is very behavioral and seems sort of like related to depression and just not caring about space.
