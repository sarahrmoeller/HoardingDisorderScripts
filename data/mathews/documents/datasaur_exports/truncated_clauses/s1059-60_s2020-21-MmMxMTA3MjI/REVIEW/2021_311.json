So this was a young woman, maybe in her 30s, she had moved into her apartment maybe only 8 months earlier, so she hadn't lived there very long. It's a very small apartment, her kitchen and living room were kind of all together like in one area, and her bedroom was a separate room, and the photos of the kitchen itself, like the place where you would prepare food and store things did not look hoarded at all. It looked extremely functional in the kitchen, but once you stepped away from the counters, there were piles of things that were more disorganized, but she described the things as not being hers or being temporarily there. Like for example, there were some closet doors that she said belonged to the landlord. And I have a hard time knowing when somebody says that, that this object is temporarily there it just belongs to someone else, I have a hard time knowing how to evaluate that in the context of hoarding because people tell themselves stories about objects in their homes. About, oh yes this belongs to someone else, and they kind of...the fact that is has sat there for a while and it's actually going to sit there for the next five years is not part of the story that they tell themselves. So, I don't quite know how to evaluate it. The most problematic room was her bedroom, however, where the mattress was on the floor and there was no visible floor space in the entire length of the room and she described this situation as being due to the fact that in the previous apartment, her bed had been a loft and she hadn't yet been able to get a bed up on a loft because it takes 3 people to handle the loft. And that under the bed, once the loft was there, would be perfect storage space for all this stuff that was in her bedroom. The things in her bedroom included bikes and quite a large pile of pillows that was not actually on her bed, and the photos made it clear that she actually sleeps on a tiny part of the bed because the rest of the bed is covered with stuff. And so it, partly because the photo was of a bed on the floor, so like if your bed is up, like my bed is a couple feet above the floor, that means that if my possessions were at the height of the bed, that would be two and a half feet of debris. But her bed was on the floor, so it made it look a little fuller than it was. But it's still true that you couldn't walk in it, and she said she couldn't walk over to the other side of the bedroom, so I have a really hard time trying to sort out, especially because different areas of the home had different functional abilities. Like the bedroom looked pretty not functional, the kitchen looked perfectly functional.
