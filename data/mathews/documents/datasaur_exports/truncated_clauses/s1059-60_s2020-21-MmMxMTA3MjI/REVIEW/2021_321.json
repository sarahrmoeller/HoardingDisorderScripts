Or do you think that the reason older people tend to have it is more related to them needing time to have accumulated that much stuff? You know, them being maybe in a social place in their lives where older people are going to be more isolated, their children have left, you know maybe left their stuff at home, they're more likely to be in a stable living space for a longer period of time rather than moving to new apartments every couple of years. Or even it's just getting picked up at that stage because they are less mobile. I guess what I'm asking is do you think it's progressive? Do you think it worsens with age, maybe do to cognitive issues or do you think that it's mostly a side effect? That it happens to be seen mostly with older people for more kind of lifestyle or social reasons?\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","And","I","guess","my","question","is,","do","you","view","hoarding","as","a","disorder","that","is","progressive","in","a","sense","of","getting","worse","with","age,","like","the","behavior","intensifies","as","a","person","ages?","Or","do","you","think","that","the","reason","older","people","tend","to","have","it","is","more","related","to","them","needing","time","to","have","accumulated","that","much","stuff?","You","know,","them","being","maybe","in","a","social","place","in","their","lives","where","older","people","are","going","to","be","more","isolated,","their","children","have","left,","you","know","maybe","left","their","stuff","at","home,","they're","more","likely","to","be","in","a","stable","living","space","for","a","longer","period","of","time","rather","than","moving","to","new","apartments","every","couple","of","years.","Or","even","it's","just","getting","picked","up","at","that","stage","because","they","are","less","mobile.","I","guess","what","I'm","asking","is","do","you","think","it's","progressive?","Do","you","think","it","worsens","with","age,","maybe","do","to","cognitive","issues","or","do","you","think","that","it's","mostly","a","side","effect?","That","it","happens","to","be","seen","mostly","with","older","people","for","more","kind","of","lifestyle","or","social","reasons?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: I think it's both. I think that all of the reasons that you listed about why it might be more evident in older people, all of those ring true and I would say maybe up until early older adulthood that would be the primary driver. Maybe add to that list deceased parents, so now you have the extra stuff that you don't know what to do with, and then I think that there probably is a progressive, even if there's not like cognitive decline, there's physical decline.
