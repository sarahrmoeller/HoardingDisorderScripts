I mean, someone may store stuff in a bathtub and say, \"I don't take baths, I'll shower at the gym.\" Someone may store stuff on the stove and say, \"Well I don't ever cook and I don't know how to cook, so it makes sense for me to use my stove as a storage space.\" I guess what I'm saying is, is there a line with that intended use aspect of the criteria, or is it all kind of about functional status and safety?\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","Another","area","that","I've","thought","about","is","this","substantially","compromises","intended","use.","So,","in","the","example","of","the","patient","that","you","gave,","he","has","five","bedrooms","and","3","of","which","are","closets,","which","is","not","their","intended","use,","and","I","guess,","who,","how","do","you","decide","where","it","crosses","the","line","for","intended","use?","I","mean,","someone","may","store","stuff","in","a","bathtub","and","say,","\"I","don't","take","baths,","I'll","shower","at","the","gym.\"","Someone","may","store","stuff","on","the","stove","and","say,","\"Well","I","don't","ever","cook","and","I","don't","know","how","to","cook,","so","it","makes","sense","for","me","to","use","my","stove","as","a","storage","space.\"","I","guess","what","I'm","saying","is,","is","there","a","line","with","that","intended","use","aspect","of","the","criteria,","or","is","it","all","kind","of","about","functional","status","and","safety?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: That's a really good one, Rebecca. I think it comes down mostly to the distress and functional status and safety. Because, like in the example of my patient, who says the bedroom is a sleeping place?

However, it's rarely in isolation. It's going to impact multiple areas of the home, and I would suspect there would be other areas where it's much more clearcut. But, I think you're right, it will be colored by their insight and justification. So, the hoarders I see, when I ask where they sleep who say they sleep on their comfy chair but they prefer it to their bed, they think they sleep better upright, so they don't want to sleep in their bed anyway, where you're right, I'm opposing my own judgment. I'm saying I think that's getting in the way of its intended use.","tokens":["Interviewee:","It","defines","it","accordingly,","but","and","it--so","your","interesting","one","is","what","if","it","covers","the","stovetop","but","the","person","says,","\"I","never","cook,","I","never","have","cooked,","I","never","wish","to","cook.\"","So,","I","think","if","somebody","told","me","that,","they've","never","cooked,","they've","never","fried,","they","don't","own","frying","pans,","they","don't","have","any","desire","to","learn","to","fry","an","egg","or","to","put","up","boiling","water","on","a","stovetop,","so","for","them","it","is","not","a","concern","or","a","problem","in","any","way,","shape","or","form,","then","I","would","be","hard","pressed","to","find","hoarding","or","clutter","that's","excessive","simply","based","on","that","stovetop","example.","However,","it's","rarely","in","isolation.","It's","going","to","impact","multiple","areas","of","the","home,","and","I","would","suspect","there","would","be","other","areas","where","it's","much","more","clearcut.","But,","I","think","you're","right,","it","will","be","colored","by","their","insight","and","justification.","So,","the","hoarders","I","see,","when","I","ask","where","they","sleep","who","say","they","sleep","on","their","comfy","chair","but","they","prefer","it","to","their","bed,","they","think","they","sleep","better","upright,","so","they","don't","want","to","sleep","in","their","bed","anyway,","where","you're","right,","I'm","opposing","my","own","judgment.","I'm","saying","I","think","that's","getting","in","the","way","of","its","intended","use."],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":7665,"email":"a.eads@ufl.edu","displayName":"Eads,
