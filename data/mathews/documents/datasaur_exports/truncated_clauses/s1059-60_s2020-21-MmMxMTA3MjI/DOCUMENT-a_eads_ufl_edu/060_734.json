In my van, I have a box that shouldn’t be in there but it’s got books to read if I have to wait, it’s got a crossword puzzle. Something’s in there that shouldn’t be in there. But I want it there. You know? So, that’s one way. Another way too, I noticed how people dress. You’ll see some people with 10-12 necklaces on and bracelets because they can’t decide what they want to do. I notice is a lot, you know, with people and they’re all hoarders. Because I’ve met them and talked to them. And they’ll tell me “I didn’t know what to wear.” So, that’s the only thing I’ve got for you. \r","tokens":["You","know","something?","this","is","really","weird","like","if","you","see","them","outside","your","house;","like","we’ll","be","driving","around,","we’ll","be","in","a","parking","lot.","I","can","tell","who’s","a","hoarder","by","their","car.","Their","dash","is","just","like","everything.","They","have","tons","of","crap","in","their","car","and","I’ve","seen","it","with","my","whole","family.","My","car","gets","like","that.","In","my","van,","I","have","a","box","that","shouldn’t","be","in","there","but","it’s","got","books","to","read","if","I","have","to","wait,","it’s","got","a","crossword","puzzle.","Something’s","in","there","that","shouldn’t","be","in","there.","But","I","want","it","there.","You","know?","So,","that’s","one","way.","Another","way","too,","I","noticed","how","people","dress.","You’ll","see","some","people","with","10-12","necklaces","on","and","bracelets","because","they","can’t","decide","what","they","want","to","do.","I","notice","is","a","lot,","you","know,","with","people","and","they’re","all","hoarders.","Because","I’ve","met","them","and","talked","to","them.","And","they’ll","tell","me","“I","didn’t","know","what","to","wear.”","So,","that’s","the","only","thing","I’ve","got","for","you."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"25:30 Interviewer:\r","tokens":["25:30","Interviewer:"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Ok, so you can spot if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their homes based on how their car looks, like the interior of their car and how people dress because it conveys a sense of undecidedness. \r","tokens":["Ok,","so","you","can","spot","if","someone","has","hoarding","disorder","without","being","in","their","homes","based","on","how","their","car","looks,","like","the","interior","of","their","car","and","how","people","dress","because","it","conveys","a","sense","of","undecidedness."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Participant:\r","tokens":["Participant:"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Yeah undecided that’s the word.
