I have individuals with fears of something incriminating being on any paper material, and so they have to check it, or being worried about throwing out something valuable getting mixed in with the items they want to discard, so the checking rituals become prohibitory difficult. You know, somebody with obsessions around personal information and identity theft, who looks to all intensive purposes superficially like a hoarder because he accumulates everything that comes in the door, but it's really about his concern around identity theft and his having to check it meticulously to make sure he didn't somehow get a piece of mail mixed up with it or something that has his phone number or credit card number or any other information on it. So, I've seen a broad variety of cases like that, but I think usually when you explore the motivation for the difficulty around the discarding, I feel clinically myself that it's not all that difficult to tease apart.
