Hmm what is the difference between normal saving… So, lets see, so my sister has an eBay business and she has all the things everywhere all over the place because he's one day sort this out and do eBay on those things.

Whereas my things I don't have any plan for. I mean I don’t even, I mean I’ve read these books and I haven't read some I know I'm never going to get to. They're like, they're all together. I'll do feeling books. They’re all good. I’ve got a good, nice collection of those. So, hoarding is when there's no plan. My grandma with her penny savers, she had a plan for those. So, she didn’t consider that to be hoarding. That was more of, she was saving those.  Whereas me with no plan, I’m just hoarding. My mom as well. With her little [unclear] for the door to the back.
