Yeah, I mean it tends to be people who answer genetics or biology as their first answer and then they generate a certain kind of list, and people who answer something more kind of cognitive like you

experiences.","tokens":["Rebecca:","Yeah,","I","mean","it","tends","to","be","people","who","answer","genetics","or","biology","as","their","first","answer","and","then","they","generate","a","certain","kind","of","list,","and","people","who","answer","something","more","kind","of","cognitive","like","you","did","like","attention","or","like","cognitive","function,","and","then","there's","maybe","like","a","third","group","who","give","very","psychological","sort","of","answers","where","it's","more","like","about","the","person's","life","and","experiences."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"And

then I guess the question is the relative contribution is more interesting, because probably genetics do play a role, yeah probably beliefs do play a role, and yes stressful early life events might

most
