Exactly, and one of the things that I ask, and I'm gonna ask you later in the interview but I guess I can jump ahead and ask it now since we're talking about this, one of the ways I get at this through the interview is I ask the question: So we talked about all these reasons for saving, to what extent do you think that these reasons are what's driving the behavior, or do you think that perhaps the behavior is what's coming first and the reasons are kind of created post hoc as justifications for an underlying need?","tokens":["Rebecca:","Exactly,","and","one","of","the","things","that","I","ask,","and","I'm","gonna","ask","you","later","in","the","interview","but","I","guess","I","can","jump","ahead","and","ask","it","now","since","we're","talking","about","this,","one","of","the","ways","I","get","at","this","through","the","interview","is","I","ask","the","question:","So","we","talked","about","all","these","reasons","for","saving,","to","what","extent","do","you","think","that","these","reasons","are","what's","driving","the","behavior,","or","do","you","think","that","perhaps","the","behavior","is","what's","coming","first","and","the","reasons","are","kind","of","created","post","hoc","as","justifications","for","an","underlying","need?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"So like when somebody is exhibiting this behavior, is it because they have a problem with their thought process where they truly believe that, you know, they're going to screw up the environment or they're gonna need it later, or is it that they're saving it and then when you ask them, \"Why do you saved this?\" they come up with a with a reason that seems to make sense to them why they would save it, but it's really behavioral driven?","tokens":["So","like","when","somebody","is","exhibiting","this","behavior,","is","it","because","they","have","a","problem","with","their","thought","process","where","they","truly","believe","that,","you","know,","they're","going","to","screw","up","the","environment","or","they're","gonna","need","it","later,","or","is","it","that","they're","saving","it","and","then","when","you","ask","them,","\"Why","do","you","saved","this?\"","they","come","up","with","a","with","a","reason","that","seems","to","make","sense","to","them","why","they","would","save","it,","but","it's","really","behavioral","driven?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: Right, that's a really good question and I think that we need more research to iron out, but the other thing I think about that sometimes is that it can be some central problem that's driving lot's of

for example if it's problems with concentration in decision making and attention, yes maybe that does create the hoarding problems and I don't think it's a post hoc explanation really, but could be,
