So for example, some people might love to have a very clear desk and only be able to work when the desk is clear; whereas other people might actually really like a crowded desk or feeling that their items are all around them, and I wonder if you've ever conceptualized or thought about hoarding disorder as being a part of that spectrum? So do you feel like perhaps a part of hoarding disorder is about liking the creation of inclosed space, or liking to be surrounded maybe on a spectrum like fear of open spaces, like the opposite or something like that where people just really like to be inclosed by items.\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","So,","kind","of","along","the","same","lines","we","can","imagine","for","normal","individuals","a","variance","in","how","they","like","to","keep","their","space.","So","for","example,","some","people","might","love","to","have","a","very","clear","desk","and","only","be","able","to","work","when","the","desk","is","clear;","whereas","other","people","might","actually","really","like","a","crowded","desk","or","feeling","that","their","items","are","all","around","them,","and","I","wonder","if","you've","ever","conceptualized","or","thought","about","hoarding","disorder","as","being","a","part","of","that","spectrum?","So","do","you","feel","like","perhaps","a","part","of","hoarding","disorder","is","about","liking","the","creation","of","inclosed","space,","or","liking","to","be","surrounded","maybe","on","a","spectrum","like","fear","of","open","spaces,","like","the","opposite","or","something","like","that","where","people","just","really","like","to","be","inclosed","by","items."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: Yeah, yeah actually that's a good point. Yeah, I think that that definitely could be the case. But I think that what's really important here if we're looking at diagnosing hoarding disorder, and actually all mental health disorders in general, I think this gets overlooked. That that last criteria, which is that like clinically significant distress and functional impairment, if the person likes it and they are not subjectively identifying any problems with their homes and yeah somebody from the outside is saying you need to do something, but they are not--so I guess if you have somebody saying, \"you're going to be evicted\" that is causing functional impairment and clinically significant distress because the state of their home is leading to them not having a residence, which then would cause distress and impairment. But if there wasn't, let's say they own their own home and the individual really does enjoy just having a lot of items around and there's some sort of safety or comfort that's associated with it and it's not actually getting in the way, like it's not impairing their ability to work or to be social or to do their hobbies or what have you, I think that that wouldn't be criteria for hoarding disorder.","tokens":["Interviewee:","Yeah,","yeah","actually","that's","a","good","point.","Yeah,","I","think","that","that","definitely","could","be","the","case.","But","I","think","that","what's","really","important","here","if","we're","looking","at","diagnosing","hoarding","disorder,","and","actually","all","mental","health","disorders","in","general,","I","think","this","gets","overlooked.","That","that","last","criteria,","which","is","that","like","clinically","significant","distress","and","functional","impairment,","if","the","person","likes","it","and","they","are","not","subjectively","identifying","any","problems","with","their","homes","and","yeah","somebody","from","the","outside","is","saying","you","need","to","do","something,","but","they","are","not--so","I","guess","if","you","have","somebody","saying,","\"you're","going","to","be","evicted\"","that","is","causing","functional","impairment","and","clinically","significant","distress","because","the","state","of","their","home","is","leading","to","them","not","having","a","residence,","which","then","would","cause","distress","and","impairment.","But","if","there","wasn't,","let's","say","they","own","their","own","home","and","the","individual","really","does","enjoy","just","having","a","lot","of","items","around","and","there's","some","sort","of","safety","or","comfort","that's","associated","with","it","and","it's","not","actually","getting","in","the","way,","like","it's","not","impairing","their","ability","to","work","or","to","be","social","or","to","do","their","hobbies","or","what","have","you,","I","think","that","that","wouldn't","be","criteria","for","hoarding","disorder."],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":7651,"email":"josephweaver@ufl.edu","displayName":"Weaver, Joseph"},"labelSets":[{"name":"HD tagset","index":0,"labelItems":[{"id":"zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r","labelName":"Incomplete Thought","parentId":null,"color":"#ffc826"},{"id":"CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R","labelName":"Self Correction","parentId":null,"color":"#33cc99"},{"id":"yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb","labelName":"Clarification","parentId":null,"color":"#3370cc"},{"id":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelName":"Generic Disfluency","parentId":null,"color":"#ff8000"},{"id":"zNhzFxWreupeViuWpVQbm","labelName":"Misspeak","parentId":null,"color":"#df3920"},{"id":"nmDmE8yCiIjn1v0WJrgTj","labelName":"Unclear","parentId":null,"color":null},{"id":"VBS0Kk5Mwre1tPCapxA3k","labelName":"Overlap","parentId":null,"color":"#9933cc"}],"leafOnlyOption":false}],"spanLabels":[],"arrowLabels":[],"boundingBoxLabels":[],"timeLabels":[],"comments":[],"url":"datasaur://static/7436/ea3563d8-ac9c-4841-b8ef-6fbac25d20c5.txt","rowAnswers":[],"documentAnswers":[]}}
