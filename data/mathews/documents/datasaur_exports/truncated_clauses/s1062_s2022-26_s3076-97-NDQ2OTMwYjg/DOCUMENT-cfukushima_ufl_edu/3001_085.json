That’s it’s an ongoing process. That even though you may deal with one particular anxiety that you know a very similar patters can arise in other so… it’s you know there could a whack-a-mole sense sometimes so it’s not like they are going to come in and get the course of CBT and they are going to get cured and their lives are going to be perfect from then on. So I think that it’s an ongoing process that and that you may need to come back for a tune up or whatever you deal with that. So I think understanding that it’s an ongoing process and you know yeah and that it will require active participation on the part of the parents. It’s not something like you just say here take care of my kid. It’s not how it works. It’s more like a partnership.  I think kind of explaining that and sort of the expectations of the parents. It not like even with drugs I mean it’s not like ok here. I think the other things is that it’s not an either or choice.  I think a lot of people parents sort of have this preconception that’s it either drugs or CBT and it’s not. It’s doesn’t need to be an either or.
