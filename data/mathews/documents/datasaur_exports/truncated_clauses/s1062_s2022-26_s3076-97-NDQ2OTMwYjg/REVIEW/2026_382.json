I think for people with hoarding based on our experience, there's a lot of worry about what happens to the items if they're not being used, there's a lot of worry about the person collecting the items, their individual emotional and physical well-being if they didn't have the items, and so I think that that's also distinct form what you would see from a collector.

I mean, most of our cases are pretty straight-forward in terms of, you know, when people are talking about their stuff or what they worry about if they did get rid of their stuff, that in combination with the sheer volume of possessions that we see. I can't think of a case where we were unclear. Certainly where we do run into issues is, and this is very different from looking at things clinically obviously, but we have folks who have other mental health issues such as schizophrenia or something like that. So sometimes for us, we're addressing the hoarding behaviors because that's what we're there for, but sometimes it's not clear, is the other mental health issue the primary factor, or is it the hoarding?
