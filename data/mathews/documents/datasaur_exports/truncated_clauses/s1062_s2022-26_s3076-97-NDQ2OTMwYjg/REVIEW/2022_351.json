So, you know I often get family members that will ask me to go and talk to their family member with them, kind of like an intervention or going in to assess. The city might ask me to go in and assess, so it depends if the client is asking to see help or agreeing with seeking help, or not. So, if the client is agreeing, they usually have some level of insight. Usually they can't understand all of how their behaviors are contributing to their anxiety or depression or whatever, or how much of a safety risk it is, but they have an idea that they have an issue, but if somebody else is referring them they usually have some insight that they have more stuff than other people, but they don't know why other people are bothered by it. SO, it kind of depends on how they come to me. And I often find clients who have a lot of stuff and are having difficulty, they have some insight. Like, a lot of times I know research says that they don't, but I find that they do understand that their living spaces do not fit other living spaces. Or how society deems them to have certain living spaces, that's why they're not letting people into their home, because they know they're going to be judged based on their living space. They may not understand fully, but they have some insight.\r","tokens":["Interviewee:","It","depends","on","how","they're","being","referred","to","me.","So,","you","know","I","often","get","family","members","that","will","ask","me","to","go","and","talk","to","their","family","member","with","them,","kind","of","like","an","intervention","or","going","in","to","assess.","The","city","might","ask","me","to","go","in","and","assess,","so","it","depends","if","the","client","is","asking","to","see","help","or","agreeing","with","seeking","help,","or","not.","So,","if","the","client","is","agreeing,","they","usually","have","some","level","of","insight.","Usually","they","can't","understand","all","of","how","their","behaviors","are","contributing","to","their","anxiety","or","depression","or","whatever,","or","how","much","of","a","safety","risk","it","is,","but","they","have","an","idea","that","they","have","an","issue,","but","if","somebody","else","is","referring","them","they","usually","have","some","insight","that","they","have","more","stuff","than","other","people,","but","they","don't","know","why","other","people","are","bothered","by","it.","SO,","it","kind","of","depends","on","how","they","come","to","me.","And","I","often","find","clients","who","have","a","lot","of","stuff","and","are","having","difficulty,","they","have","some","insight.","Like,","a","lot","of","times","I","know","research","says","that","they","don't,","but","I","find","that","they","do","understand","that","their","living","spaces","do","not","fit","other","living","spaces.","Or","how","society","deems","them","to","have","certain","living","spaces,","that's","why","they're","not","letting","people","into","their","home,","because","they","know","they're","going","to","be","judged","based","on","their","living","space.","They","may","not","understand","fully,","but","they","have","some","insight."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: So, it sounds like you're almost drawing a distinction here between two different kind of levels or kinds of insight. So, it sounds like you're saying that most people are aware that they have more space than average, or they have more stuff than average, and to some extent are aware that there's stigma around having this much stuff or that other people might not get it. And then there's kind of the second level, which is recognizing that having so much stuff is causing them distress, or causing their life to have--having negative impacts on their lives. And it sounds like you're saying the first kind of insight, recognizing the behavior as abnormal is pretty common, and then the second level of insight, recognizing the behavior as kind of contributing to difficulties in their life, is less common or more difficult to achieve.
