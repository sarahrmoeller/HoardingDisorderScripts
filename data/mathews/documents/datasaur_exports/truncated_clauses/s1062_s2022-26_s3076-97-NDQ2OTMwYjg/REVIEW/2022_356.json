You know, they often will talk about how they tried to manage it or that they tried to keep things clear and they tried to work on their discarding, and then something else has happened. So I think when they're adults there's also accumulation of stuff, the life events that have happened, they're also accumulating a lot of the times stuff of their children or grandchildren that lived in their home, they're also dealing with major life stressors that may be contributing to the difficulties that they're having. They also have mobility and other health issues that are involved, so they can't do the same things that they used to do like move things around or get rid of things. They may not be driving, but I think that it may not be that the actual hoarding or the actual feelings or attachment has gotten worse with older adults, I think it's accumulation of what's happened in their life. Like the life events and the accumulation of items, because my clients that are 18 can talk about items the same way and have the same feelings as somebody in their 80s. And usually the older adults don't have the outside influence of their parents or spouse or partner, roommates that are stopping them from over cluttering.
