So, if the person isn't impacted, if it isn't interfering even if the person is saying it's not really stressful or causing distress, but is it interfering to a significant degree and trying to speak or talk to the person about that. Like for example, one of the individuals I worked with who the county was threatening eviction, he didn't see any problem with his difficulty. He didn't experience distress, either related to that perceived need to save or the difficulty discarding. Well he did, but he didn't subjectively identify that as a problem, and so he had decided that there was distress when he was deciding to get rid of things, so he would keep them, and the excessive acquisition brought pleasure for him or it was something that he enjoyed doing, so the only piece that led to the impairment was someone from the outside saying that he had a problem. But they had power so they were the one threatening eviction, and so then even though he didn't have insight into his disorder, he didn't have insight into the difficulty. It actually had caused a lot of problems with his relationships, like he was estranged from his whole family but he didn't have insight that the hoarding was a part of that really, and so really the only area--he did agree with the fact that yeah this is causing distress and I will be impaired if I don't have a home to live in, I won't be able to do anything if I don't have a home, and so at that
