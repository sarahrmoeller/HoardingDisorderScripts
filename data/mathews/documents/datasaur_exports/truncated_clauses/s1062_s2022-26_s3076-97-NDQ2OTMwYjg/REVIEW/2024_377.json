You know, anecdotally, I have had a couple patients talk about that and talk about that when they were younger or not having, yeah not having food or not necessarily having what they need, and so ultimately wanting to and kind of learning not to waste, right, talking about that sort of idea of like I shouldn't waste anything because there was a time that I didn't have anything and maybe in the future I might not have anything. Or like maybe something would happen, you know, like I'll need this and I'll be in hard times again. And actually one of the, like an interesting case example is, I can't remember his name, I think it was a Chinese artist who's mother struggled with hoarding, one second I'm just gonna look up the name of it. Oh, Song Dong, and so she was an artist and he grew up in China and his mother basically there was just like economic difficulties in China as he was--or as she was growing up, and so she learned basically to save and to not waste because of those difficulties, just in case that were to happen again. Like it was just kind of a value that she learned because of what was happening in society and that was a big part of her difficulty. It was rooted in her experience as a child and not having what she needed. I've heard that form many patients and not everybody for sure, but definitely some and there was this idea that, \"I don't want that to ever happen again or at least I want to do what I can to prevent that from happening if I ever were in a situation where I didn't have what I needed.\" I don't see that that often, but I have seen it a couple of times.","tokens":["Interviewee:","Mhhm,","yeah,","good","question.","You","know,","anecdotally,","I","have","had","a","couple","patients","talk","about","that","and","talk","about","that","when","they","were","younger","or","not","having,","yeah","not","having","food","or","not","necessarily","having","what","they","need,","and","so","ultimately","wanting","to","and","kind","of","learning","not","to","waste,","right,","talking","about","that","sort","of","idea","of","like","I","shouldn't","waste","anything","because","there","was","a","time","that","I","didn't","have","anything","and","maybe","in","the","future","I","might","not","have","anything.","Or","like","maybe","something","would","happen,","you","know,","like","I'll","need","this","and","I'll","be","in","hard","times","again.","And","actually","one","of","the,","like","an","interesting","case","example","is,","I","can't","remember","his","name,","I","think","it","was","a","Chinese","artist","who's","mother","struggled","with","hoarding,","one","second","I'm","just","gonna","look","up","the","name","of","it.","Oh,","Song","Dong,","and","so","she","was","an","artist","and","he","grew","up","in","China","and","his","mother","basically","there","was","just","like","economic","difficulties","in","China","as","he","was--or","as","she","was","growing","up,","and","so","she","learned","basically","to","save","and","to","not","waste","because","of","those","difficulties,","just","in","case","that","were","to","happen","again.","Like","it","was","just","kind","of","a","value","that","she","learned","because","of","what","was","happening","in","society","and","that","was","a","big","part","of","her","difficulty.","It","was","rooted","in","her","experience","as","a","child","and","not","having","what","she","needed.","I've","heard","that","form","many","patients","and","not","everybody","for","sure,","but","definitely","some","and","there","was","this","idea","that,","\"I","don't","want","that","to","ever","happen","again","or","at","least","I","want","to","do","what","I","can","to","prevent","that","from","happening","if","I","ever","were","in","a","situation","where","I","didn't","have","what","I","needed.\"","I","don't","see","that","that","often,","but","I","have","seen","it","a","couple","of","times."],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":7436,"email":"smoeller@ufl.edu","displayName":"Sarah Moeller"},"labelSets":[{"name":"HD tagset","index":0,"labelItems":[{"id":"zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r","labelName":"Incomplete Thought","parentId":null,"color":"#ffc826"},{"id":"CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R","labelName":"Self Correction","parentId":null,"color":"#33cc99"},{"id":"yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb","labelName":"Clarification","parentId":null,"color":"#3370cc"},{"id":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelName":"Generic Disfluency","parentId":null,"color":"#ff8000"},{"id":"zNhzFxWreupeViuWpVQbm","labelName":"Misspeak","parentId":null,"color":"#df3920"},{"id":"nmDmE8yCiIjn1v0WJrgTj","labelName":"Unclear","parentId":null,"color":null},{"id":"VBS0Kk5Mwre1tPCapxA3k","labelName":"Overlap","parentId":null,"color":"#9933cc"}],"leafOnlyOption":false}],"spanLabels":[{"id":"1702697339","labelSetIndex":0,"labeledBy":"REVIEWER","labeledByUserId":7643,"acceptedByUserId":null,"rejectedByUserId":null,"layer":0,"counter":0,"status":"LABELED","hashCode":"SPAN:CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R:0:1:0:170:0:1:0:171:6:0:undefined:undefined","labelName":"CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R","labelItem":{"id":"CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R","labelName":"Self Correction","parentId":null,"color":"#33cc99"},"textPosition":{"start":{"row":1,"column":0,"tokenIndex":170,"charIndex":0},"end":{"row":1,"column":0,"tokenIndex":171,"charIndex":6}},"confidenceScore":null}],"arrowLabels":[],"boundingBoxLabels":[],"timeLabels":[],"comments":[{"id":"47323","parentId":null,"hashCode":"SPAN_TEXT:1:0:143:0:1:0:144:4","message":"May need to censor this","type":"SPAN_TEXT","userId":7651,"createdAt":"2025-02-07T03:23:34.000Z"},{"id":"47324","parentId":null,"hashCode":"SPAN_TEXT:1:0:245:0:1:0:245:3","message":"Mispelling","type":"SPAN_TEXT","userId":7651,"createdAt":"2025-02-07T03:24:04.000Z"}],"url":"datasaur://static/7436/1702af82-7e28-46ca-896f-5482cd27a369.txt","rowAnswers":[],"documentAnswers":[]}}
