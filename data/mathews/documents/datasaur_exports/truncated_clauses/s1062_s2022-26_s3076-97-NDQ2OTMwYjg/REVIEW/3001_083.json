I would say at least for my older son certainly definitely seemed to help him and you know dealing with school and performance anxiety, you know those issues. So I think it has been positive for him. I think it has helped him gain perspective on what is going on. I think it helped to destigmatize it to a certain extent. I think it made him more self-aware of the issues and you know helped him deal with it so I think that there is some partial possible benefits.  So for me I guess it has been helpful. You know because of patient confidentiality you don’t really have much insight to what is actually happening on a day to day bases. Somewhat dependent on what the child tells you which… so I don’t have a good sense of what the individual activities he did or what… you know I have some sense they were essentially trying to you know throw curveballs and sort of disrupt you know such [09:58] ___  still function in a chaotic environment. I think there was an attempt to make it fun and enjoyable, not stressful. So I think that was… maybe something that I thought was… I kind of had a maybe bias that you know essentially it was more of a graded response and that you kind of helped people get over their level of anxiety with… elicited.  I don’t know I think I had an unpleasant association sort of with that idea that you would be sort of stressing them, and I think that’s what was most surprising to me was that it was not as stressful as um….
