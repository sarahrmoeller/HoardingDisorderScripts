Okay I do have some thoughts about that. So, I think, I've thought a lot about overvalued ideation and the lack of an ability to perceive a problem, like just not seeing clutter as an issue or maybe not even being able to see the clutter, really or perceive that the space, to not be able to recognize the illness in that way I think that's kind of what we were talking a little bit about with insight before, that an individual just might not be able to see that there's a problem. And so I think that definitely comes up a lot, I've seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, I think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, I think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. I think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. I think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, I already kind of mentioned, \"There's a specific way I have to discard of this item and it's so important that I do this in a very specific way and if not I'm a bad person,\" for example. And that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn't discard in a specific kind of way, they're a bad person. So there's this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don't want to feel like a bad person. So I think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and I think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and OCD as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like \"My rituals are important, I need to do my checking because if not I might murder somebody and I don't want to be responsible for that.\"\r", "tokens": ["Interviewee:", "Yeah", "I", "would", "love", "to", "read", "that,", "yeah.", "Okay", "I", "do", "have", "some", "thoughts", "about", "that.", "So,", "I", "think,", "I've", "thought", "a", "lot", "about", "overvalued", "ideation", "and", "the", "lack", "of", "an", "ability", "to", "perceive", "a", "problem,", "like", "just", "not", "seeing", "clutter", "as", "an", "issue", "or", "maybe", "not", "even", "being", "able", "to", "see", "the", "clutter,", "really", "or", "perceive", "that", "the", "space,", "to", "not", "be", "able", "to", "recognize", "the", "illness", "in", "that", "way", "I", "think", "that's", "kind", "of", "what", "we", "were", "talking", "a", "little", "bit", "about", "with", "insight", "before,", "that", "an", "individual", "just", "might", "not", "be", "able", "to", "see", "that", "there's", "a", "problem.", "And", "so", "I", "think", "that", "definitely", "comes", "up", "a", "lot,", "I've", "seen", "that", "with", "most", "folks,", "but", "definitely", "some", "in", "particular", "that", "one", "individual", "who", "was", "coming", "in", "because", "of", "the", "threat", "of", "eviction,", "I", "think", "there", "was", "a", "lack", "of", "an", "ability", "to", "see", "the", "problem,", "I", "think", "that", "was", "probably", "one", "of", "the", "most", "important", "pieces", "as", "well.", "I", "think", "a", "lot", "of", "the", "times", "overvalued", "ideation,", "like", "this", "idea.", "I", "think", "that", "comes", "up", "a", "lot", "and", "that", "comes", "up", "in", "that", "people", "have,", "I", "already", "kind", "of", "mentioned,", "\"There's", "a", "specific", "way", "I", "have", "to", "discard", "of", "this", "item", "and", "it's", "so", "important", "that", "I", "do", "this", "in", "a", "very", "specific", "way", "and", "if", "not", "I'm", "a", "bad", "person,\"", "for", "example.", "And", "that", "thought", "becomes", "true,", "right,", "in", "that", "if", "this", "person", "doesn't", "discard", "in", "a", "specific", "kind", "of", "way,", "they're", "a", "bad", "person.", "So", "there's", "this", "maybe", "avoidance", "of", "discarding", "because", "they", "don't", "want", "to", "feel", "like", "a", "bad", "person.", "So", "I", "think", "the", "overvalued", "ideation", "comes", "up", "a", "lot", "and", "I", "think", "that", "can", "also", "come", "up", "in", "like", "generalized", "anxiety", "disorder", "and", "OCD", "as", "well,", "this", "idea", "that", "the", "symptoms", "are", "important,", "like", "\"My", "rituals", "are", "important,", "I", "need", "to", "do", "my", "checking", "because", "if", "not", "I", "might", "murder", "somebody", "and", "I", "don't", "want", "to", "be", "responsible", "for", "that.\""], "metadata": []}], [{"content": "Interviewer: So like, they're really convinced that they have to do it or some terrible thing is going to happen to them.\r", "tokens": ["Interviewer:", "So", "like,", "they're", "really", "convinced", "that", "they", "have", "to", "do", "it", "or", "some", "terrible", "thing", "is", "going", "to", "happen", "to", "them."], "metadata": []}], [{"content": "Interviewee: Right, right, exactly, exactly, so there might be that same thing happening in hoarding disorder like, \"I am convinced that I'm a bad person because I just contributed to this plastic thing in the ocean and maybe that means that these thoughts will never leave me, that I'm always going to feel like a bad person and that doing anything differently will just result in me getting stuck with all these thoughts and all these negative feelings and I want to make sure I do it right.\" And so a lot of times when we're doing like exposures for hoarding disorder, I think there is a bit of perfectionism in terms of overvalued ideation.
