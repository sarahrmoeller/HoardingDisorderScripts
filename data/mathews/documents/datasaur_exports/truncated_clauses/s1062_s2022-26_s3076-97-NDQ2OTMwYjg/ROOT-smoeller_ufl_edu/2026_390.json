We're less worried about the mental health diagnosis, our goal is to provide case management intervention so that people aren't losing their homes. And so, if you think about treatment more broadly and less kind of clinically, you know I guess you could make an argument that that what we're doing, that our focus is not on the mental health side, it's on the social service intervention side. In addition to that, we've partnered with [INSTITUTION 8:03] to do some research because we have a very large data base of information that we've collected over the years, to better understand the problem of hoarding as we see it in the community so that we can have a better response in terms of housing stability and eviction prevention.\r","tokens":["Interviewee:","So","we","don't","do","diagnosis.","We're","less","worried","about","the","mental","health","diagnosis,","our","goal","is","to","provide","case","management","intervention","so","that","people","aren't","losing","their","homes.","And","so,","if","you","think","about","treatment","more","broadly","and","less","kind","of","clinically,","you","know","I","guess","you","could","make","an","argument","that","that","what","we're","doing,","that","our","focus","is","not","on","the","mental","health","side,","it's","on","the","social","service","intervention","side.","In","addition","to","that,","we've","partnered","with","[INSTITUTION","8:03]","to","do","some","research","because","we","have","a","very","large","data","base","of","information","that","we've","collected","over","the","years,","to","better","understand","the","problem","of","hoarding","as","we","see","it","in","the","community","so","that","we","can","have","a","better","response","in","terms","of","housing","stability","and","eviction","prevention."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: And how long have you worked with these individuals?\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","And","how","long","have","you","worked","with","these","individuals?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: Since 2006.\r","tokens":["Interviewee:","Since","2006."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: So, now we're gonna talk a little bit about the diagnosis of hoarding and we have some questions, which we kind of use with clinicians but I'm really curious to your encounters with them and your ideas about them, so if you don't feel like these pertain particularly to you that's okay.

I think for people with hoarding based on our experience, there's a lot of worry about what happens to the items if they're not being used, there's a lot of worry about the person collecting the items, their individual emotional and physical well-being if they didn't have the items, and so I think that that's also distinct form what you would see from a collector.
