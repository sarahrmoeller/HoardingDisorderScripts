People are so focused on the clutter, what's secondary to... what's actually hoarding and what is secondary to other mental health or physical health problem. The other thing that comes up is issues around trauma, so how does trauma kind of fit in. So, you know, some of the comorbidity research shows that there's a low rate of PTSD. Folks I've met with will talk about a traumatic event, it doesn't mean that it's PTSD and there's some myths out there that trauma causes hoarding and the research doesn't really support that. So I think that can affect the diagnosing a bit and the issues around the criteria a bit in terms of the role of trauma. \r","tokens":["Interviewee:","I","think","the","other","things","is","that,","so","there's","comorbidity","that","come","out","with","hoarding","around","depression,","around","OCD","and","so","forth","and","I","think","that","sometimes","there's","confusion","in","the","field","around","that","in","terms","of","what","is","what.","People","are","so","focused","on","the","clutter,","what's","secondary","to...","what's","actually","hoarding","and","what","is","secondary","to","other","mental","health","or","physical","health","problem.","The","other","thing","that","comes","up","is","issues","around","trauma,","so","how","does","trauma","kind","of","fit","in.","So,","you","know,","some","of","the","comorbidity","research","shows","that","there's","a","low","rate","of","PTSD.","Folks","I've","met","with","will","talk","about","a","traumatic","event,","it","doesn't","mean","that","it's","PTSD","and","there's","some","myths","out","there","that","trauma","causes","hoarding","and","the","research","doesn't","really","support","that.","So","I","think","that","can","affect","the","diagnosing","a","bit","and","the","issues","around","the","criteria","a","bit","in","terms","of","the","role","of","trauma."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: Can you think of a challenging case where you were unsure if something was truly hoarding disorder or either another mental health disorder or something that's on the spectrum of hoarding behavior?
