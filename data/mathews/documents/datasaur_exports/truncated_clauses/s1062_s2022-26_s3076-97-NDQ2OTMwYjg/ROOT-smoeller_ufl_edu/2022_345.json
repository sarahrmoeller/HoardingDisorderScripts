Like, you may see hoarding disorder or hoarding behavior, so I have to often...even though somebody had hoarding behaviors in the community but no one ever really diagnosed them, and if they come into a care setting like a long-term care setting or a hospital, they're still having that hoarding behavior and the difficulty discarding, but they wouldn't meet the criteria because their space isn't cluttered because they're living in a care home, but they still would have hoarding disorder. So, I think there's a lack of looking at the [INAUDIBLE 17:22] spaces with the diagnosis. So, I think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. And you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. I also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. Like in the area where I live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience. So, clients can't see somebody that can diagnose them with something because of the lack of experience with professionals.
