And I think it's really important for anybody to understand that not everybody lives in the same way, like I wound't necessarily live in a home like my friend who has lots of stuff, but she may be more comfortable in that space than I am.

You know, this person is hoarding and then I go into their home and they just have a lot of stuff. There's no safety risks, but their family or their mental health worker just views it as being like not good or not a way that they would live.
