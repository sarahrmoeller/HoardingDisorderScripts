However, I think the difference is, like it's interesting that you mentioned cuckoo clocks because I've actually worked with an individual who loved cuckoo clocks and had several cuckoo clocks, but as we were doing our decluttering exercises, she was coming across one she hadn't seen in years and forgot she owned. So I think, you know, she loved cuckoo clocks and she had several, she even had one up on her wall actually; however, we were finding cuckoo clocks that she didn't even remember she had because they were lost in her clutter. And so, ultimately, you know, I think we could say she was collecting, and that was aesthetic, that was purely just loving cuckoo clocks and the way they look. And she loved Germany and she got several from Germany and things like that, so there might be some, maybe this can make it down to that sentimental value, too, so there might be some reasons why this person liked cuckoo clocks, but ultimately, yes I think that an individual can hoard one kind of item or a specific kind of item. However, I don't think it's limited to that. So like, this individual who loved cuckoo clocks also acquired a lot of other things, so it was more than just the cuckoo clocks and I think that's why this individual wasn't able to enjoy the cuckoo clocks in the way that someone who was just collecting them might, because she wasn't able to find them or retrieve them when she wanted to. Or even, you know, eventually folks might forget that they have some of these objects, right. So I think that with collecting, individuals mostly know like what items they have, they can pull them out and look at them.\r","tokens":["Interviewee:","Yeah,","yeah,","definitely,","I","think","you","can.","However,","I","think","the","difference","is,","like","it's","interesting","that","you","mentioned","cuckoo","clocks","because","I've","actually","worked","with","an","individual","who","loved","cuckoo","clocks","and","had","several","cuckoo","clocks,","but","as","we","were","doing","our","decluttering","exercises,","she","was","coming","across","one","she","hadn't","seen","in","years","and","forgot","she","owned.","So","I","think,","you","know,","she","loved","cuckoo","clocks","and","she","had","several,","she","even","had","one","up","on","her","wall","actually;","however,","we","were","finding","cuckoo","clocks","that","she","didn't","even","remember","she","had","because","they","were","lost","in","her","clutter.","And","so,","ultimately,","you","know,","I","think","we","could","say","she","was","collecting,","and","that","was","aesthetic,","that","was","purely","just","loving","cuckoo","clocks","and","the","way","they","look.","And","she","loved","Germany","and","she","got","several","from","Germany","and","things","like","that,","so","there","might","be","some,","maybe","this","can","make","it","down","to","that","sentimental","value,","too,","so","there","might","be","some","reasons","why","this","person","liked","cuckoo","clocks,","but","ultimately,","yes","I","think","that","an","individual","can","hoard","one","kind","of","item","or","a","specific","kind","of","item.","However,","I","don't","think","it's","limited","to","that.","So","like,","this","individual","who","loved","cuckoo","clocks","also","acquired","a","lot","of","other","things,","so","it","was","more","than","just","the","cuckoo","clocks","and","I","think","that's","why","this","individual","wasn't","able","to","enjoy","the","cuckoo","clocks","in","the","way","that","someone","who","was","just","collecting","them","might,","because","she","wasn't","able","to","find","them","or","retrieve","them","when","she","wanted","to.","Or","even,","you","know,","eventually","folks","might","forget","that","they","have","some","of","these","objects,","right.","So","I","think","that","with","collecting,","individuals","mostly","know","like","what","items","they","have,","they","can","pull","them","out","and","look","at","them."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: Can you think of a specific case or cases that was challenging for you to diagnose?
