Many of my clients work full-time jobs and they work in government jobs and they work as teachers or whatever, and they don't look at all like they would have a typical hoarding disorder, but if I saw somebody that you know...they usually are carrying a lot of random things like shopping bags or reusable bags that have like a lot of paper or bottles. Sometimes they look like they haven't bathed or showered because they may not have the ability to shower often.
