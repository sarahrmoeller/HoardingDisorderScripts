I mean, most of our cases are pretty straight-forward in terms of, you know, when people are talking about their stuff or what they worry about if they did get rid of their stuff, that in combination with the sheer volume of possessions that we see. I can't think of a case where we were unclear. Certainly where we do run into issues is, and this is very different from looking at things clinically obviously, but we have folks who have other mental health issues such as schizophrenia or something like that. So sometimes for us, we're addressing the hoarding behaviors because that's what we're there for, but sometimes it's not clear, is the other mental health issue the primary factor, or is it the hoarding? And I think that's where it gets tricky and it's very different than how this would be clinically diagnosed.\r","tokens":["Interviewee:","Um,","not","really.","I","mean,","most","of","our","cases","are","pretty","straight-forward","in","terms","of,","you","know,","when","people","are","talking","about","their","stuff","or","what","they","worry","about","if","they","did","get","rid","of","their","stuff,","that","in","combination","with","the","sheer","volume","of","possessions","that","we","see.","I","can't","think","of","a","case","where","we","were","unclear.","Certainly","where","we","do","run","into","issues","is,","and","this","is","very","different","from","looking","at","things","clinically","obviously,","but","we","have","folks","who","have","other","mental","health","issues","such","as","schizophrenia","or","something","like","that.","So","sometimes","for","us,","we're","addressing","the","hoarding","behaviors","because","that's","what","we're","there","for,","but","sometimes","it's","not","clear,","is","the","other","mental","health","issue","the","primary","factor,","or","is","it","the","hoarding?","And","I","think","that's","where","it","gets","tricky","and","it's","very","different","than","how","this","would","be","clinically","diagnosed."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: And how do you deal with those situations?\r","tokens":["Rebecca:","And","how","do","you","deal","with","those","situations?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: You know, in a lot of the situations we'll do more behavioral work, you know, we've got a partnership with our department of mental health, we work with a lot of their more challenging individuals who will do a lot of things like using blue painter's tape to create an egress path and working with the individuals to get them used to keeping that egress path clear and then reducing the height of piles and getting them used to doing that by using other visual cues.
