An interview, I don’t know. I know when I first saw it go down that’s when I was like woah this is what we’re doing and then leaving and thinking that was so simple and so obvious. In some ways being like this is not going to do anything because of just how simple and obvious it was but then being immediately… given examples-seeing personal examples with my child but oh my God it totally worked. Its working and it’s totally useful. Because it did seem so simple, right why wouldn’t we face your fears and why wouldn’t we, you know. I think its almost sometimes giving the permission and the confidence that yes, this is what we’re going to do and it is going to be okay. You are going to be okay. That kind of thing because at first I was sort of like oh this is like I’m glad we didn’t sign up for block off two weeks of our lives to do this because at first I was like this is very basic and very simple. But it got quick results and I remember immediately just being like wow that’s pretty cool. Let’s see what’s next. Yup wow that was really cool too. Having my child feel the same way because the place of terror you’re coming from feels so all-encompassing and for something so simple to give you such relief and control is nice. I don’t know if there is any way to present that. I don’t know if that’s other people’s experiences, I certainly hope so. \r","tokens":["Speaker:","What’s","it","like,","you","know,","whatever.","An","interview,","I","don’t","know.","I","know","when","I","first","saw","it","go","down","that’s","when","I","was","like","woah","this","is","what","we’re","doing","and","then","leaving","and","thinking","that","was","so","simple","and","so","obvious.","In","some","ways","being","like","this","is","not","going","to","do","anything","because","of","just","how","simple","and","obvious","it","was","but","then","being","immediately…","given","examples-seeing","personal","examples","with","my","child","but","oh","my","God","it","totally","worked.","Its","working","and","it’s","totally","useful.","Because","it","did","seem","so","simple,","right","why","wouldn’t","we","face","your","fears","and","why","wouldn’t","we,","you","know.","I","think","its","almost","sometimes","giving","the","permission","and","the","confidence","that","yes,","this","is","what","we’re","going","to","do","and","it","is","going","to","be","okay.","You","are","going","to","be","okay.","That","kind","of","thing","because","at","first","I","was","sort","of","like","oh","this","is","like","I’m","glad","we","didn’t","sign","up","for","block","off","two","weeks","of","our","lives","to","do","this","because","at","first","I","was","like","this","is","very","basic","and","very","simple.","But","it","got","quick","results","and","I","remember","immediately","just","being","like","wow","that’s","pretty","cool.","Let’s","see","what’s","next.","Yup","wow","that","was","really","cool","too.","Having","my","child","feel","the","same","way","because","the","place","of","terror","you’re","coming","from","feels","so","all-encompassing","and","for","something","so","simple","to","give","you","such","relief","and","control","is","nice.","I","don’t","know","if","there","is","any","way","to","present","that.","I","don’t","know","if","that’s","other","people’s","experiences,","I","certainly","hope","so."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewer: We’re glad that it’s your experience. \r","tokens":["Interviewer:","We’re","glad","that","it’s","your","experience."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Speaker: Yeah. \r","tokens":["Speaker:","Yeah."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewer: Okay, so presenting kind of like how that could… How it seems-\r","tokens":["Interviewer:","Okay,","so","presenting","kind","of","like","how","that","could…","How","it","seems-"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Speaker: Yeah.
