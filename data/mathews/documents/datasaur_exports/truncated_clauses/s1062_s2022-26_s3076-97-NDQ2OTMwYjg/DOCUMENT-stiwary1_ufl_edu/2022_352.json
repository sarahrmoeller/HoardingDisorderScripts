So, the construct are defensiveness, anosognosia, which is defined as the lack of ability to perceive and illness or that something is wrong or causing distress. The third one is overvalued ideation, which is kind of the persistent belief that the value of items is more than it is in reality, and then the final one is indifference. Of those four, and I'll read them again--defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideation and indifference--do you feel like some of them are more relevant and some are less relevant?

Like why they're keeping something, or why it's not a problem and why other people shouldn't perceive it as a problem, they're I=kind of defending their behavior. I don't know whether or not, you know I often find that people are like that or are defensive because of past bad experiences they've had. When I explore it further with them, they have to become defensive because other people have said things like, \"This is disgusting\" or \"how can you live like this?\" So they immediately become defensive, but if often you have a good relationship with the person, you talk things further, they can get to the place where they understand that it's a problem, but their first reaction is defensiveness and it's usually because something bad has happened.
