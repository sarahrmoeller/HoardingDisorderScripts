Another thing that has come out in these interviews has to do with the diagnostic criteria that reads, \"The difficulty discarding results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.\" And that seems to be what you're talking about in terms of the space kind of impairing the person's life. I'm wondering how you think about, and I'm sure this is something that you encounter, the fact that if you have less space, if you're living in a very small apartment for instance, it's much easier for your space to become congested and cluttered as opposed to somebody who lives in a huge mansion who has plenty of space, or somebody who can afford storage units. Do you feel like it's easier for a person who has a small apartment to have hoarding disorder, or do you feel like that doesn't really play out that way?\r","tokens":["Interviewee:","Okay.","Another","thing","that","has","come","out","in","these","interviews","has","to","do","with","the","diagnostic","criteria","that","reads,","\"The","difficulty","discarding","results","in","the","accumulation","of","possessions","that","congest","and","clutter","active","living","areas","and","substantially","compromises","their","intended","use.\"","And","that","seems","to","be","what","you're","talking","about","in","terms","of","the","space","kind","of","impairing","the","person's","life.","I'm","wondering","how","you","think","about,","and","I'm","sure","this","is","something","that","you","encounter,","the","fact","that","if","you","have","less","space,","if","you're","living","in","a","very","small","apartment","for","instance,","it's","much","easier","for","your","space","to","become","congested","and","cluttered","as","opposed","to","somebody","who","lives","in","a","huge","mansion","who","has","plenty","of","space,","or","somebody","who","can","afford","storage","units.","Do","you","feel","like","it's","easier","for","a","person","who","has","a","small","apartment","to","have","hoarding","disorder,","or","do","you","feel","like","that","doesn't","really","play","out","that","way?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewee: I think people with hoarding disorder are going to fill the available space.

So, if somebody's not cooking but they've still got items on their stove, that's a fire hazard that could impair their health and safety if there were to be a fire. So just given what we know about how long it takes to intervene in hoarding-related fires, and so I think that people with hoarding may look very narrowly at impairment, while we're looking much more broadly at is this impacting your ability to carry out daily life activities? Is it impacting your ability to remain safely housed? Is it impacting your health and wellbeing overall in ways that the person might not necessarily see, given the disabling nature of hoarding.","tokens":["Interviewee:","I","think","that's","where","we","have","to","look","at,","you","know,","there","are","a","lot","of","different","kinds","of","impairment.","So,","if","somebody's","not","cooking","but","they've","still","got","items","on","their","stove,","that's","a","fire","hazard","that","could","impair","their","health","and","safety","if","there","were","to","be","a","fire.","So","just","given","what","we","know","about","how","long","it","takes","to","intervene","in","hoarding-related","fires,","and","so","I","think","that","people","with","hoarding","may","look","very","narrowly","at","impairment,","while","we're","looking","much","more","broadly","at","is","this","impacting","your","ability","to","carry","out","daily","life","activities?","Is","it","impacting","your","ability","to","remain","safely","housed?","Is","it","impacting","your","health","and","wellbeing","overall","in","ways","that","the","person","might","not","necessarily","see,","given","the","disabling","nature","of","hoarding."],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":7646,"email":"sotodaniel@ufl.edu","displayName":"Soto, Daniel A."},"labelSets":[{"name":"HD tagset","index":0,"labelItems":[{"id":"zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r","labelName":"Incomplete Thought","parentId":null,"color":"#ffc826"},{"id":"CVVUxC8SvzFkW325Jv13R","labelName":"Self Correction","parentId":null,"color":"#33cc99"},{"id":"yJ2I5X2l397BXK0vkQOqb","labelName":"Clarification","parentId":null,"color":"#3370cc"},{"id":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelName":"Generic Disfluency","parentId":null,"color":"#ff8000"},{"id":"zNhzFxWreupeViuWpVQbm","labelName":"Misspeak","parentId":null,"color":"#df3920"},{"id":"nmDmE8yCiIjn1v0WJrgTj","labelName":"Unclear","parentId":null,"color":null},{"id":"VBS0Kk5Mwre1tPCapxA3k","labelName":"Overlap","parentId":null,"color":"#9933cc"}],"leafOnlyOption":false}],"spanLabels":[{"id":"1706527662","labelSetIndex":0,"labeledBy":"LABELER","labeledByUserId":7646,"acceptedByUserId":null,"rejectedByUserId":null,"layer":0,"counter":0,"status":"LABELED","hashCode":"SPAN:-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R:0:2:0:39:0:2:0:41:8:0:undefined:undefined","labelName":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelItem":{"id":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelName":"Generic Disfluency","parentId":null,"color":"#ff8000"},"textPosition":{"start":{"row":2,"column":0,"tokenIndex":39,"charIndex":0},"end":{"row":2,"column":0,"tokenIndex":41,"charIndex":8}},"confidenceScore":null},{"id":"1706527665","labelSetIndex":0,"labeledBy":"LABELER","labeledByUserId":7646,"acceptedByUserId":null,"rejectedByUserId":null,"layer":0,"counter":0,"status":"LABELED","hashCode":"SPAN:zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r:0:4:0:17:0:4:0:20:13:0:undefined:undefined","labelName":"zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r","labelItem":{"id":"zynoJJigppWPaLrXIbl7r","labelName":"Incomplete Thought","parentId":null,"color":"#ffc826"},"textPosition":{"start":{"row":4,"column":0,"tokenIndex":17,"charIndex":0},"end":{"row":4,"column":0,"tokenIndex":20,"charIndex":13}},"confidenceScore":null},{"id":"1706527668","labelSetIndex":0,"labeledBy":"LABELER","labeledByUserId":7646,"acceptedByUserId":null,"rejectedByUserId":null,"layer":0,"counter":0,"status":"LABELED","hashCode":"SPAN:-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R:0:5:0:5:0:5:0:9:2:0:undefined:undefined","labelName":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelItem":{"id":"-JMh1Z2QiTPafZ-k12D4R","labelName":"Generic Disfluency","parentId":null,"color":"#ff8000"},"textPosition":{"start":{"row":5,"column":0,"tokenIndex":5,"charIndex":0},"end":{"row":5,"column":0,"tokenIndex":9,"charIndex":2}},"confidenceScore":null}],"arrowLabels":[],"boundingBoxLabels":[],"timeLabels":[],"comments":[],"url":"datasaur://static/7436/98972c45-ce95-4a36-a073-b832d8abf43a.txt","rowAnswers":[],"documentAnswers":[]}}
