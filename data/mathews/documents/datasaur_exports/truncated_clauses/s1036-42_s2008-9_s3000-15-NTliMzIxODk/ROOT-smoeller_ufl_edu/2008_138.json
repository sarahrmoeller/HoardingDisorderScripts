Well one of the things that I think about a lot to capitalize on where they’re at so there was something well let me backup I take a very MI approach to this so that’s probably the simplest way to answer that so you you kind of roll with the resistance but you try to them really flesh out um their potential reasons for change the potential barriers to change and and the ultimate hope would be you are going to kind of increase this readiness for change kind of like mental preparedness for change um but I I really keep that in mind throughout treatment with hoarding patients because there are going to be weeks where whatever it is that you are sorting is going to be sorting is going to um it it's just going to be tougher and so maybe you're just going to have more of a challenge that week than than others so just kind of rolling with that resistance and helping the patient can navigate that um an making it okay that you understand um you know similar to someone one with subs abuse
