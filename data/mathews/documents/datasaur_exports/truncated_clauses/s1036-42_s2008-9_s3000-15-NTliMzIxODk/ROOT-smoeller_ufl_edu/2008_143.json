those beliefs but its not that its like that challenging you ask anyone who works with hoarding patients what its challenging I would be shocked if not on one of their top ten list is getting them to do their homework and telling them to do it um so I think that that’s the part where the external forces is just so instrumental because it just helps in um you know but I say that but there’s some days like they still NAME (1:47:45)’s group has tried a token economy an that you know works just about as well as everything else we do ie not that impressively um and so I do think there’s something
