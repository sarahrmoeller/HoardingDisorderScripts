like in your home so some might like to have a clear desk while others might prefer to have things out and ready to use do you feel like hoarding disorder could be an extension of that variance that surpasses the acceptable threshold you know we had another interviewer say ‘some people just want to be surrounded by their things’ and live more cave like if you will you mentioned that

items and the distress associated with discarding them and we wanted to talk about how you determine the distress with this disorder how do you determine how much distress with discarding is normal or

in their mind that distress comes in like one from so we do have to talk about that distress can come in the guise as anger can come in the guise and anxiety can come in the guise as like grief you know there’s like a range of emotion that can reflect or capture that distress and as long as you are kind of thinking about it in that perspective then you know then I think that the other part that probably is when it does kind of start to get tricky is when they haven’t been exposed to having to discard right like it has not occurred to them that they need to get rid of anything um and so they haven’t really elicited the distress um in any sort of concrete
