think a really important piece to understanding that is knowing what is normative saving and what is is not normative saving and the cool notion about collecting I think its really fascinating and so in six months I’ll have more concrete answers for you guys about what I think really distinguishes uh abnormal from normal behaviors um and I'm not sure if our hypothesis are going to to pan out I mean the most obvious thing is the level of like the threshold at which you save something and the threshold at which you let something go that is much higher for hoarding patients then it is for those of us who don’t have hoarding um I also think that the rigidity with regard to saving rules is also one of the factors that differentiate and then seeing value in things I think it’s the other piece that is going to really differentiate normal from abnormal","tokens":["And","I","think","a","really","important","piece","to","understanding","that","is","knowing","what","is","normative","saving","and","what","is","is","not","normative","saving","and","the","cool","notion","about","collecting","I","think","its","really","fascinating","and","so","in","six","months","I’ll","have","more","concrete","answers","for","you","guys","about","what","I","think","really","distinguishes","uh","abnormal","from","normal","behaviors","um","and","I'm","not","sure","if","our","hypothesis","are","going","to","to","pan","out","I","mean","the","most","obvious","thing","is","the","level","of","like","the","threshold","at","which","you","save","something","and","the","threshold","at","which","you","let","something","go","that","is","much","higher","for","hoarding","patients","then","it","is","for","those","of","us","who","don’t","have","hoarding","um","I","also","think","that","the","rigidity","with","regard","to","saving","rules","is","also","one","of","the","factors","that","differentiate","and","then","seeing","value","in","things","I","think","it’s","the","other","piece","that","is","going","to","really","differentiate","normal","from","abnormal"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"P2:

really interested in these young adults and college students are these really fascinating group because it’s the first time they are living alone but they are still living in this fairly controlled environments um so better understanding which of those students are doing to go on to become our eventual hoarding patients is is something that I'm really curious about and and importantly our core diagnosis criteria of clutter is absolutely worthless with that group of young adults cause they A haven’t had time to collect enough stuff and B they’re living in controlled environment they are living in like a two by two foot dorm room with a roommate (laughing) um and so none of these students would meet for clutter like none of them so they wouldn’t get the diagnoses of hoarding so we absolutely see difficulties discarding um and a lot of the similar features that we see with like like clinical hoarding patients like the older patients we also see with these younger kids um so that’s part of it another study that we did but isn’t really related to that is that we recruited eighteen gender match healthy control and then collectors people who do not meet the diagnosis for hoarding but they have a collection and they identity has a collector and then hoarding disorder patients so we basically artificially created a dimension um by oversampling those three groups","tokens":["Interviewee:","Yeah","so","we","well","first","of","all","I'm","really","interested","in","these","young","adults","and","college","students","are","these","really","fascinating","group","because","it’s","the","first","time","they","are","living","alone","but","they","are","still","living","in","this","fairly","controlled","environments","um","so","better","understanding","which","of","those","students","are","doing","to","go","on","to","become","our","eventual","hoarding","patients","is","is","something","that","I'm","really","curious","about","and","and","importantly","our","core","diagnosis","criteria","of","clutter","is","absolutely","worthless","with","that","group","of","young","adults","cause","they","A","haven’t","had","time","to","collect","enough","stuff","and","B","they’re","living","in","controlled","environment","they","are","living","in","like","a","two","by","two","foot","dorm","room","with","a","roommate","(laughing)","um","and","so","none","of","these","students","would","meet","for","clutter","like","none","of","them","so","they","wouldn’t","get","the","diagnoses","of","hoarding","so","we","absolutely","see","difficulties","discarding","um","and","a","lot","of","the","similar","features","that","we","see","with","like","like","clinical","hoarding","patients","like","the","older","patients","we","also","see","with","these","younger","kids","um","so","that’s","part","of","it","another","study","that","we","did","but","isn’t","really","related","to","that","is","that","we","recruited","eighteen","gender","match","healthy","control","and","then","collectors","people","who","do","not","meet","the","diagnosis","for","hoarding","but","they","have","a","collection","and","they","identity","has","a","collector","and","then","hoarding","disorder","patients","so","we","basically","artificially","created","a","dimension","um","by","oversampling","those","three","groups"],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":7436,"email":"smoeller@ufl.edu","displayName":"Sarah
