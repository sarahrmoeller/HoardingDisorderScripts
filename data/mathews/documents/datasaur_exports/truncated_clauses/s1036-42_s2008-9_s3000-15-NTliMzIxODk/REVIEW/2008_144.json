Oh my god um I’ll be here forever if I answer that but I really don’t know I think it's so fascinating its like you know I started studying it almost by accident back in like you know early 2000’s and here I am still looking at it um I think that the most important that thing we can do in navigating hoarding research in moving forward is getting out of the mindset of this being an OC spectrum disorder um I think that it hoarding has grown up so much um from with in the shadow of of OCD that is has shaped a lot of how we conceptualize this condition and how we conceptualize the symptoms and the INAUDIBLE (1:49:40) and the validity everything an the more that we are learning about hoarding the more I think that we need to stop doing that it is almost like this perfect storm disorder where you get you know high levels of depression high levels of anxiety you have these personality features you have executive function deficits you have like everything um and it just I think that part of the reason why it's so challenging um yeah but so I I don’t make me pick one answer
