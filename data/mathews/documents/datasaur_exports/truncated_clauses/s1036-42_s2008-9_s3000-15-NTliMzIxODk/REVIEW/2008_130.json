Yeah so is this like for the treatment or like our groups that we run um I'm super flexible with the clutter criterion because I just think that if somebody’s telling me that they are distressed and impaired because of their attachment to objects regardless to whether that results in clutter that is at the level the is required based on the DSM I will let them in for our research study it’s a lot more challenging um so you know because people want to know if oh you define hoarding disorder like it is in the DSM then you have to make sure that they meet that way so basically what I've been doing is doing like a shadow um definition which is to really hone in on the difficulties discarding as the kind of primary diagnostic criterion because it its and issue our field is going to have to grapple with in um and I think especially as we start to look at hoarding across the globe I think these where it's going to be particularly relevant um if you put me living in a camper trailer it's automatically going to feel more cluttered even though I'm not a cluttered person right you know then if you put me in a special you know five bedroom like mansion space and how much access we have to space is something we have to think about I don’t think there’s any clear cut answers right now and then the other diagnostic criteria I have a huge issue with um is the acquiring um so identifying acquiring as uh the specified and I just I'm just like ‘hang on a moment’ okay so we have a patient who has full blown hoarding but the don’t have acquiring so they say no to acquiring nine time out of ten those patients are either actively avoiding any sort of situation where they may be tempted to acquire or they’ve run out of money okay like they literally can’t like they are barely feeding themselves and their family um or there’s some other like kind of extenuating circumstance like I've never purchased things and then you find out all their like of our magazines disappear from that waiting groom every time that patient stops by and so I think that its is it doesn’t allow for a nuanced description of uh the acquiring issue in hoarding and just because you are avoiding something does not mean you do not have a problem with acquiring you have a really big problem with acquiring but we live in a very materialistic world so your constantly exposed to stuff so those are my two bones that I have to pick with
