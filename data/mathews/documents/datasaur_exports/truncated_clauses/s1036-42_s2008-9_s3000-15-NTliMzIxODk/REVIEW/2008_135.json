a little bit more like psychosis um your more garden variety hoarding disorder patient will also have variable insight but the thing that I find so fascinating about that insight is that it is so variable and its like this floating insight an it think that it we don’t have a good way of defining what exactly it is like we haven’t fully operationalized what we mean by insight and you know
