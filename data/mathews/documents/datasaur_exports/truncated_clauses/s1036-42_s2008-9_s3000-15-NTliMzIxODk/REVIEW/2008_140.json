hoarding disorder with their patients we wanted you to think through some of the questions from the adopted version of that brown assessment of belief deal and we want you to kind of think from the

maybe I mean I don’t want to be wasteful’ but I think that question wont make as much sense to them like if I were to ask you guys ‘why do you you know keep your old note or why do you keep a card
