Definitely talk to is NAME (1:30:16) and I'm goanna if you haven’t already reached out to NAME (1:30:19) I'm going to send you his email um NAME (1:30:22) runs the housing up in CITY (1:30:25) and NAME (1:20:27) has I think really different insight because he’s reaching patients through the department of housing before they self identify um and so I think that his perspective about you know how does insight and motivation for treatment how does that all play out is is really different from those of us who are kind of in a little bit more um I don’t know uh elitist type of treatment programs right where by the time somebody has called within the greater CITY (1:31:06) community they have found their way to the study of anxiety stress and OCD at the UNIVERSITY (1:31:12) I mean they absolutely already have some insight um now not everybody is ready for what it takes to do this treatment which is probably why I kind of have this unspoken rule that everybody has to do the facilitated self help group first and then they kind of work up to the CBT group and then they work up to the individual therapy um sometimes we break that rule but rarely and I think part of it is we have them do the self help group first to try to figure out ‘are you really ready for this?’ um do you have to have enough kind of motivation to kind of push through uh those tough

Well I think it's basically what I you know what I kind of touched on before is that for low insight it would mean either there is an aspect that they cannot recognize right they’re like looking at the dead birds that they have collected and they’re like ‘they are happy and healthy’ like they do not recognize that they have a problem um that’s obviously an extreme example but but then it think that the other way I would define insight is this variable insight which would be more of that defensiveness the overvalued ideation and then the indifference piece like ‘what’s it to you that my house it cluttered?’ um I think clinicians constantly get in to trouble when we want to get them like to a one on the clutter image rating and they’re totally fine being at a four right like ‘what’s the big deal?’ um so
