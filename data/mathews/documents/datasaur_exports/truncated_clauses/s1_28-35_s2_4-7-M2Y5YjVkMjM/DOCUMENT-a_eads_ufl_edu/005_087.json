Hm um, I remember a few people that shared with me that they were they were in the beginning very ambivalent about where they had a problem or whether they want to get treatment, and so they they started to to enter this ambivalent and because somehow they they started to realize this is not normal or not everybody or not many people can encounter situations like this and I think they actually some of them mentioned that they were watching the hoarder show, and then it was kind of making them like to think ‘ am I like that?’ or ‘how much am I not like them’ and they started to like have a context of ‘oh how that’s like’ or ‘how I can compare to this person in the TV show’, so that has pros and cons and that sometimes encouraged them to to want to um get more information’s about, it sometimes is makes them feel like um they’re very scared to come out because the hoarders show is very extreme and so they will start and then then look for more information and um an then almost like staring to open their eyes up and starting to pay attention to to things and resources and a lot of my um our folks are familiar with the local organization, um mental health association, they do um a lot of outreach to to different settings so they they start to get in touch with this organization so they start to get in touch with their peer group and a lot of people in the peer support group they are still um kind of like feel like they are just clutter-ers they are not hoarders, they are very sensitive about the the differentiation of the two different types of people.","tokens":["P3:","Hm","um,","I","remember","a","few","people","that","shared","with","me","that","they","were","they","were","in","the","beginning","very","ambivalent","about","where","they","had","a","problem","or","whether","they","want","to","get","treatment,","and","so","they","they","started","to","to","enter","this","ambivalent","and","because","somehow","they","they","started","to","realize","this","is","not","normal","or","not","everybody","or","not","many","people","can","encounter","situations","like","this","and","I","think","they","actually","some","of","them","mentioned","that","they","were","watching","the","hoarder","show,","and","then","it","was","kind","of","making","them","like","to","think","‘","am","I","like","that?’","or","‘how","much","am","I","not","like","them’","and","they","started","to","like","have","a","context","of","‘oh","how","that’s","like’","or","‘how","I","can","compare","to","this","person","in","the","TV","show’,","so","that","has","pros","and","cons","and","that","sometimes","encouraged","them","to","to","want","to","um","get","more","information’s","about,","it","sometimes","is","makes","them","feel","like","um","they’re","very","scared","to","come","out","because","the","hoarders","show","is","very","extreme","and","so","they","will","start","and","then","then","look","for","more","information","and","um","an","then","almost","like","staring","to","open","their","eyes","up","and","starting","to","pay","attention","to","to","things","and","resources","and","a","lot","of","my","um","our","folks","are","familiar","with","the","local","organization,","um","mental","health","association,","they","do","um","a","lot","of","outreach","to","to","different","settings","so","they","they","start","to","get","in","touch","with","this","organization","so","they","start","to","get","in","touch","with","their","peer","group","and","a","lot","of","people","in","the","peer","support","group","they","are","still","um","kind","of","like","feel","like","they","are","just","clutter-ers","they","are","not","hoarders,","they","are","very","sensitive","about","the","the","differentiation","of","the","two","different","types","of","people."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Yeah
