Hm yeah, yeah this is a very good question, hm, I would I would say at least half of the case this is very more conservative estimation, I would say this would be the more um uh more superficial reasons and it may and I don’t know if it's something they come up to justify the behavior, or this is a kind of like a defense mechanism for something more vulnerable deep down, yeah I um I’m thinking as I’m saying this I am remembering sometimes like several cases in the groups that I led, people would realize actually a lot of times they are they are having under the real underlying issue for example, for one person who had shared, he doesn’t know he wouldn’t know what to do with his life if he no longer has hoarding problems, its almost like now he has something to focus on and if if I don’t have to focus on this, and my problem is solved he will be facing something that’s terribly scary and I don’t know what to do with my life and so I I as I’m answering the question I’m thinking, about this example and I think there are other examples too like, its more about the emotions underlying underlying that’s probably more scary to face so they are probably more like uh um the more uh thoughts and justifications for for all this behaviors and they are thinking of ‘this is why I should keep this’ so its to not directly tough the emotions for example loss of a family member, or yeah loss of an identity of the past that they used to have when they were still working, for example,
