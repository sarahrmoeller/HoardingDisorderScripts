seen people who have um who don’t have a lot of a lot of clutter, but they still have other emotional attachment that is very typical for people with hoarding problems and um so it seems that clutter

are still in the early stage of the disease then they don’t have as much um symptoms and that’s how I see it, I actually see it this um this criteria as a a like additional like help to diagnose but
