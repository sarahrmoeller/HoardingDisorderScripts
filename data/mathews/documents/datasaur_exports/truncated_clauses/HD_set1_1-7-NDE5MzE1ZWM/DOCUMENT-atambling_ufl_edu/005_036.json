The first scenario is that John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.

Stacks of boxes occupy in one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized but is usually not cluttered. Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.
