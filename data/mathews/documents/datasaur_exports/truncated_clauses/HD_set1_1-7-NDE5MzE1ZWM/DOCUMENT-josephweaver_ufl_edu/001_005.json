So for the first story, John Doe has several boxes that he likes to keep in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized but not usually cluttered. Occasionally it's different for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he's rarely late in getting where he needs to be. Okay. So the person depicted in the story, in your opinion, do you think they have hoarding disorder or is their behavior like a clutter problem?\r","tokens":["Okay.","So","for","the","first","story,","John","Doe","has","several","boxes","that","he","likes","to","keep","in","case","he","needs","to","store","something","or","decides","to","move.","When","items","are","delivered","to","his","house,","he","keeps","the","container","the","item","came","in.","He","is","worried","that","he","might","get","rid","of","a","box","he","will","need","later.","Stacks","of","boxes","occupy","one","of","his","closets","but","there","are","no","boxes","in","other","rooms.","His","house","is","not","always","organized","but","not","usually","cluttered.","Occasionally","it's","different","for","Mr.","Doe","to","find","his","car","keys","and","wallet","so","he'll","spend","a","few","minutes","looking","for","them","until","he","eventually","finds","them.","When","this","happens,","he's","rarely","late","in","getting","where","he","needs","to","be.","Okay.","So","the","person","depicted","in","the","story,","in","your","opinion,","do","you","think","they","have","hoarding","disorder","or","is","their","behavior","like","a","clutter","problem?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Participant 1:\r","tokens":["Participant","1:"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"No. No. Neither.
