Yeah. Good. I have one more vignette to go through. It's about value and things that are valuable. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. Okay. Do you think this person has hoarding disorder? \r","tokens":["Yeah.","Yeah.","Good.","I","have","one","more","vignette","to","go","through.","It's","about","value","and","things","that","are","valuable.","John","Doe","has","several","antiques","that","he","keeps","because","he","likes","them","and","knows","they","are","valuable.","He","goes","out","once","a","week","and","buys","more","antiques.","He's","worried","that","he","might","get","rid","of","an","antique","item","that","is","worth","a","lot","of","money.","Antiques","occupy","every","room.","Before","entering","his","bathroom,","he","must","remove","several","antique","items.","Often","it","is","difficult","for","Mr.","Doe","to","find","his","car","keys","and","wallet,","so","he","will","spend","30","minutes","to","an","hour","looking","for","them","until","he","eventually","finds","them","or","forgets","what","he","was","looking","for.","He","is","almost","always","late","in","getting","to","where","he","needs","to","be,","and","sometimes","does","not","show","up","at","all.","Okay.","Do","you","think","this","person","has","hoarding","disorder?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Participant 006:\r","tokens":["Participant","006:"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Not sure if it's hoarding or just organization. \r","tokens":["Not","sure","if","it's","hoarding","or","just","organization."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewer:\r","tokens":["Interviewer:"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Okay.
