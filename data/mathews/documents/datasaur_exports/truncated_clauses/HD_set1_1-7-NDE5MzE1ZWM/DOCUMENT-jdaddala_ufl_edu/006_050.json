When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered, and it is difficult for him to walk in his house. Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. \r","tokens":["John","Doe","has","several","boxes","that","he","keeps","in","case","he","needs","to","store","something","or","decides","to","move.","When","items","are","delivered","to","his","house,","he","keeps","the","container","the","item","came","in.","He","is","worried","that","he","might","get","rid","of","a","box","he","will","need","later.","Stacks","of","boxes","occupy","every","room.","Before","entering","his","bathroom,","he","must","remove","several","stacks","of","boxes.","His","house","is","extremely","cluttered,","and","it","is","difficult","for","him","to","walk","in","his","house.","Often,","it","is","difficult","for","Mr.","Doe","to","find","his","car","keys","and","wallet,","so","he","will","spend","30","minutes","to","an","hour","looking","for","them,","until","he","eventually","finds","them","or","forgets","what","he","was","looking","for.","He","is","almost","always","late","in","getting","to","where","he","needs","to","be,","and","sometimes","does","not","show","up","at","all."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Participant 006:\r","tokens":["Participant","006:"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Wow. \r","tokens":["Wow."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Interviewer:\r","tokens":["Interviewer:"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Do you think that this person could have hoarding disorder?
