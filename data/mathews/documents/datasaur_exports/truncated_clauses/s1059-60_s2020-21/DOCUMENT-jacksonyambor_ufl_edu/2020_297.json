I've questioned, in the early days I was strongly influenced by Gail Steketee and Randy Frost, thinking about acquiring as a core feature and wondered if it shouldn't be up there as a diagnostic feature, but over the years I've seen so many who don't endorse it as an active part, that if it were a requirement for diagnosis, it would have to be an option, right, it would have to be not absolutely required. So, I think that's actually fair, that's been a change in my thinking over the years. I sometimes think the language around the urge to save things is just a little bit, maybe just a little bit awkward potentially, because I think when I meet with individuals, you know it just says difficulty discarding regardless of the actual--the need to save due to distress associated with discarding. I think that's part of it, but for many of them it's also the strong urge to keep things. And sometimes I will meet people who say, \"It's not that I can't discard them, I just feel the need to keep everything cuz I might want it or need it.\" So, sometimes the way that the criteria is phrased sometimes seems like a slightly awkward fit to me for that reason. \r","tokens":["Interviewee:","Um,","for","the","most","part","I","feel","like","criteria","works","pretty","well,","actually.","I've","questioned,","in","the","early","days","I","was","strongly","influenced","by","Gail","Steketee","and","Randy","Frost,","thinking","about","acquiring","as","a","core","feature","and","wondered","if","it","shouldn't","be","up","there","as","a","diagnostic","feature,","but","over","the","years","I've","seen","so","many","who","don't","endorse","it","as","an","active","part,","that","if","it","were","a","requirement","for","diagnosis,","it","would","have","to","be","an","option,","right,","it","would","have","to","be","not","absolutely","required.","So,","I","think","that's","actually","fair,","that's","been","a","change","in","my","thinking","over","the","years.","I","sometimes","think","the","language","around","the","urge","to","save","things","is","just","a","little","bit,","maybe","just","a","little","bit","awkward","potentially,","because","I","think","when","I","meet","with","individuals,","you","know","it","just","says","difficulty","discarding","regardless","of","the","actual--the","need","to","save","due","to","distress","associated","with","discarding.","I","think","that's","part","of","it,","but","for","many","of","them","it's","also","the","strong","urge","to","keep","things.","And","sometimes","I","will","meet","people","who","say,","\"It's","not","that","I","can't","discard","them,","I","just","feel","the","need","to","keep","everything","cuz","I","might","want","it","or","need","it.\"","So,","sometimes","the","way","that","the","criteria","is","phrased","sometimes","seems","like","a","slightly","awkward","fit","to","me","for","that","reason."],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Rebecca: Mhhm, so one of the criteria discussed kind of difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of actual value, and I'm wondering if you ever think of the value of items as part of your kind of process. Do you have to have value, does the objective value of the item play into it? So, could someone, for instance, hypothetically hoard extremely valuable items? There was a, for instance as an example, a case of an art collector who's house was completely filled and absolutely unorganized and unmanageable, but all of the objects were, you know, priceless art artifacts or paintings and sculptures.
