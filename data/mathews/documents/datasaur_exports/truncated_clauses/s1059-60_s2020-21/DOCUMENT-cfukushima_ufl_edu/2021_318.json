So a person who is living in a big house where they raised their children, it's not uncommon for people to have an area of the basement that has their kid's possessions, they might want it someday. But if it's interfering with their living space, most people...very few people keep every single thing their baby ever touched.

I mean you could again extend that example outward and say, \"I don't have any guests, so why do I need a guest room?
