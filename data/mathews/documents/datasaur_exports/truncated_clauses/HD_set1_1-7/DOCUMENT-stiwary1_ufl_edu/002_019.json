I'm going to read it, okay? John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container that the item came in, he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stack of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered. It is difficult for him to walk in his house. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's always late in getting where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.
