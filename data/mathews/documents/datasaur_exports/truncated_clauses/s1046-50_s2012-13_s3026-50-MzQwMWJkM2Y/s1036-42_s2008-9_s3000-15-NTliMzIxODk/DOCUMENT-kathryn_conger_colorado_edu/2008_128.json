the answer I think it has to do with perception issue you know a lot of these like first generation or even second generation lets say let's take the Cuban immigrants for example they have fought tooth and nail for what they have and now I'm going to come in a tell them that it’s a problem that they can’t move easily through their home of course they are going to be resistant to that they are not going to self identify with that so I think there a big part of that um I I think that we don’t understand enough about what hoarding looks like in other ethnicities and then certainly also from what we know of um the epidemiology studies is that there is no gender difference and if I focus on my young adults there is no gender difference so somewhere in
