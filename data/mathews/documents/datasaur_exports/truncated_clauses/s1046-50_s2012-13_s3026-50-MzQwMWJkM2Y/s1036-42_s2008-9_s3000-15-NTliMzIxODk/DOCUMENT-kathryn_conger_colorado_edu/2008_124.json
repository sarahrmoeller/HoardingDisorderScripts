Yeah so so I I fell into hoarding when I was actually before I went to graduate school so I was biochemistry major as an undergrad and I was headed to medical school to go into psychiatry and then like my senior year I I in the spring of my senior year I was like ‘I don’t I don’t think I want to go to medical school’ so I took some time off and worked in a lab for the NIH with a guy by the name of NAME (38:23) um NAME (38:27) has since passed away but he was one of he’s a real great in the OCD world um you know like NAME (38:35) and um NAME (38:39) and NAME (38:40) and and a ton of people that their post-doc training with NAME (38:44) and so you know he had a focus on looking at the serotonin transporter gene so there was a genetics lab kind of more neuroscience slash genetics portion and then they also did family studies of patients with OCD um but I kind of got interested in the OCD portion even though I was there to do more of the animal studies with uh the serration transporter not that INAUDIBLE (39:15) but I became really fascinated by these patients with OCD and their families um and and even early on and this was like forever ago right this was 2001 yeah like 2001 2002 2003 um there were these patients that were you know with in the pile of heterogeneity of OCD that weren’t behaving how all the rest were so they were they didn’t respond to treatment psychotherapy as well they they messed up all of the genetics results (laughing) they were just a huge pain in the butt and so NAME (39:55) was one of the first uh labs to really adopt NAME (40:03) and NAME (40:05)’s saving inventory revised to so with in his sample of OCD um we started looking at hoarding behaviors um so fast forward I decided to not go into neuroscience and not to go into medical school and I instead got my PhD in clinical psychology and I did that at UNIVERSITY (40:26) um with NAME (40:27) who is actually an anxiety researcher but um NAME (40:34) was great because he let me do whatever I wanted to and what I kept gravitating back to was OCD and then this like mystery group of patients um which was the focus of hoarding um so yeah so that’s my background so I'm a clinical psychologist and after I finished my PhD I did all of my clinical internships and my postdoc up at UNIVERSITY (41:01) uh with OCD and related disorders program up there and I've been down here at UNIVERSITY (41:03) for the last eight years","tokens":["Interviewee:","Yeah","so","so","I","I","fell","into","hoarding","when","I","was","actually","before","I","went","to","graduate","school","so","I","was","biochemistry","major","as","an","undergrad","and","I","was","headed","to","medical","school","to","go","into","psychiatry","and","then","like","my","senior","year","I","I","in","the","spring","of","my","senior","year","I","was","like","‘I","don’t","I","don’t","think","I","want","to","go","to","medical","school’","so","I","took","some","time","off","and","worked","in","a","lab","for","the","NIH","with","a","guy","by","the","name","of","NAME","(38:23)","um","NAME","(38:27)","has","since","passed","away","but","he","was","one","of","he’s","a","real","great","in","the","OCD","world","um","you","know","like","NAME","(38:35)","and","um","NAME","(38:39)","and","NAME","(38:40)","and","and","a","ton","of","people","that","their","post-doc","training","with","NAME","(38:44)","and","so","you","know","he","had","a","focus","on","looking","at","the","serotonin","transporter","gene","so","there","was","a","genetics","lab","kind","of","more","neuroscience","slash","genetics","portion","and","then","they","also","did","family","studies","of","patients","with","OCD","um","but","I","kind","of","got","interested","in","the","OCD","portion","even","though","I","was","there","to","do","more","of","the","animal","studies","with","uh","the","serration","transporter","not","that","INAUDIBLE","(39:15)","but","I","became","really","fascinated","by","these","patients","with","OCD","and","their","families","um","and","and","even","early","on","and","this","was","like","forever","ago","right","this","was","2001","yeah","like","2001","2002","2003","um","there","were","these","patients","that","were","you","know","with","in","the","pile","of","heterogeneity","of","OCD","that","weren’t","behaving","how","all","the","rest","were","so","they","were","they","didn’t","respond","to","treatment","psychotherapy","as","well","they","they","messed","up","all","of","the","genetics","results","(laughing)","they","were","just","a","huge","pain","in","the","butt","and","so","NAME","(39:55)","was","one","of","the","first","uh","labs","to","really","adopt","NAME","(40:03)","and","NAME","(40:05)’s","saving","inventory","revised","to","so","with","in","his","sample","of","OCD","um","we","started","looking","at","hoarding","behaviors","um","so","fast","forward","I","decided","to","not","go","into","neuroscience","and","not","to","go","into","medical","school","and","I","instead","got","my","PhD","in","clinical","psychology","and","I","did","that","at","UNIVERSITY","(40:26)","um","with","NAME","(40:27)","who","is","actually","an","anxiety","researcher","but","um","NAME","(40:34)","was","great","because","he","let","me","do","whatever","I","wanted","to","and","what","I","kept","gravitating","back","to","was","OCD","and","then","this","like","mystery","group","of","patients","um","which","was","the","focus","of","hoarding","um","so","yeah","so","that’s","my","background","so","I'm","a","clinical","psychologist","and","after","I","finished","my","PhD","I","did","all","of","my","clinical","internships","and","my","postdoc","up","at","UNIVERSITY","(41:01)","uh","with","OCD","and","related","disorders","program","up","there","and","I've","been","down","here","at","UNIVERSITY","(41:03)","for","the","last","eight","years"],"metadata":[]}]],"labelerInfo":{"id":1010,"email":"kathryn.conger@colorado.edu","displayName":"kathryn.conger@colorado.edu"},"labelSets":[{"name":"HD
