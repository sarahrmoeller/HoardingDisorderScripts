So we’re uh its bazaar in uh in the world of clinical psych especially if your associated with a university in STATE (41:29) it’s the same way for other states as well but but um STATE (41:31) in particular I don’t actually have to be licensed (laughing) so I personally do not see patients but within our group I mention to you we do my lab focuses um on risk and vulnerability across anxiety OC spectrum um so some of the work we do is looking at trans diagnosis risk factors um some of the work we do is focused on OCD and then probably a a third to a half of the work we do is focused on all things hoarding so as result of that um it’s a real conundrum down down here and considering how big of a city CITY (42:18) is um it's always shocking to me I mean I can barely find treatment provides for anxiety and OCD so for forget hoarding like there really isn’t anyone else um who does anything remotely helpful for these patients um and I'm not being a snotty academic uh who is over stating the reality of it it's really like tough down here so as a result of that we um do have on going groups that we provided which I then supervise and so that how I still have a lot of contact with patients um we do the facilitated self help group and then we do group therapy for hoarding patients um and then so that’s more CBT focused group therapy and then we also do individual therapy for hoarding
