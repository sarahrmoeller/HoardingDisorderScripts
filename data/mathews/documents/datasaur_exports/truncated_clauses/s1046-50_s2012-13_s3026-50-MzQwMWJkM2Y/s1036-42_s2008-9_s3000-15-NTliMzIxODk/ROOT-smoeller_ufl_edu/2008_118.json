No so I'm actually in the neuroscience department and where my side of things kind of comes in is that I’m going to be working on a project related to uh psychophysiology of hoarding disorder and so studying a couple of different uh ERP waveforms and I think eventually um I’d like to look at some of those wave forms in the context of the the findings that we have with our hoarding participants so if there are differences in um specific subgroups based on um motivations for hoarding that they have or based on degree of insight or construct of insight that more prevalent in certain subgroups and see if that responds to differences in uh different waveforms different ERP

Oh yeah very interesting okay cool yeah yeah so this is great um is so when I you know when I saw it on when NAME (2:08) sent out the the note and then also I think NAME (2:11) and I've been threatening to collaborate for for a couple of years now uh this seem like a great a great you know potential project but you know it also sounds like you guys are pretty far along much further along than um I I have been in in my thinking of such a project and because I I don’t have um I I don’t have uh people power to kind of push this forward so uh everybody’s busy doing other things so yeah I mean I where my thinking was um it I'm very curious about there’s what like five groups that really understand hoarding um maybe that’s even being a little generous NAME NAME NAME and NAME (3:07-3:11) and then me and there’s like the smaller world of IOCDF that knows a little bit more about hoarding but you know certainly doesn’t have an appreciation for it as as kind of as deeply as we do and then
