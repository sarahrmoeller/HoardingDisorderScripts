Mhm yeah I think I mean uh partially what we want to do with this data is to try to get better at differentiating that so they way we recruited for that study was to use really strict exclusion inclusion criteria if you’re in the hoarding group you have to meet for DSM five criteria for hoarding disorder okays so it's pretty strict how we define that inclusion with the healthy controls you have to have to not meet that diagnosis and you have to be below the means of that SIR okay so with in the like normative healthy range of on the saving inventory revised and then for the collectors the only criteria we used for them was that they could not meet the criteria for hoarding disorder which most of them did not meet for two reasons one they didn’t have the clutter and then two they had difficulties discarding but only with respect to the thing they collected let me tell you there are so many weird collections out there (laughing) that alone was fascination um like they guy who collected fire hydrants he had a hard time he had extreme difficulty discarding his fire hydrants (laughing) but he did not have a difficulty discarding anything
