aren’t going to tell you um so once we know that they are hoarding patients obviously that provides a whole different context for how we may be interpreting what other ailments they have um let alone having them attending treatment for for the hoarding specifically um so yeah so that’s what I've been wanting to think about you know being able to survey treatment providers um of different

Mhm yeah so that a really interesting kind of idea so NAME (4:54) and I had started theses interviews with this really core group of experts and as he kind of put it there not like a huge intellectual community right now of people who are really plugged in to you know what it means to have hoarding disorder so we started with those people and then we’ve been talking recently about whether or not we want to get people who are more on the periphery um last time we had talked about this we had um mentioned maybe just doing interviews with clinicians who had just seen a hoarders or two who were not um you know by any means specializing in this and to see how there understanding is different how they go through the process of diagnosing someone with hoarding disorder and compare that with the people who were really at the center of what’s happening and we’ve also talked even about doing interviews with people who encounter people with this disorder through like housing services or um you know task force task forces um surrounding how this just to see again um and you’ll see in our interview we haven’t so far asked about popular perceptions of hoarding disorder mostly because we’ve been interviewing people who are experts in it but it is something we are interested in kind of understanding what is out there and what is the you know the popular understating influencing how people are coming in for treatment and how their understanding what’s happening in their own behavior um yeah sorry I don’t know if you want to add to that NAME
