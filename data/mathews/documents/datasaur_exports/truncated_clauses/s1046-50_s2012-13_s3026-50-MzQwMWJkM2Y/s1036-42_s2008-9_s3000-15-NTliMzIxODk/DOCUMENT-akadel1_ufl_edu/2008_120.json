Oh okay well NAME (7:15) is a social work um she works at the unit- social work PHD and works at the UNIVERSITY (7:24) um and she does a lot of qualitative work and um and and I think its uh provides such a richer nuanced kind of perspective um that then from there you can go on to use that knowledge that that rich data that you gather to develop something that is a little more quantitative but tis more kind of informed quantitative right um it's not just whatever I'm envisioning and coming up with um so so initially what I have been thinking about it's that it would be interesting to kind of even just think about a case sample of uh you know yes the experts but then you know like a first year medical resident would be really interesting person to kind of think through ‘have you heard of hoarding?’ ‘is that something you would think about asking about?’ um ‘why do you think that would matter?’ you know like all that type of stuff um you know somebody who's going into social work who have not had exposure to hoarding which is ninety percent of social workers out there just because it's not taught in the curriculum uh you know your average kind of researched based clinical psychologist um you know same thing on that end um and then from there thinking though like where are our gaps is it dissemination about information about hoarding?","tokens":["Interviewee:","Oh","okay","well","NAME","(7:15)","is","a","social","work","um","she","works","at","the","unit-","social","work","PHD","and","works","at","the","UNIVERSITY","(7:24)","um","and","she","does","a","lot","of","qualitative","work","and","um","and","and","I","think","its","uh","provides","such","a","richer","nuanced","kind","of","perspective","um","that","then","from","there","you","can","go","on","to","use","that","knowledge","that","that","rich","data","that","you","gather","to","develop","something","that","is","a","little","more","quantitative","but","tis","more","kind","of","informed","quantitative","right","um","it's","not","just","whatever","I'm","envisioning","and","coming","up","with","um","so","so","initially","what","I","have","been","thinking","about","it's","that","it","would","be","interesting","to","kind","of","even","just","think","about","a","case","sample","of","uh","you","know","yes","the","experts","but","then","you","know","like","a","first","year","medical","resident","would","be","really","interesting","person","to","kind","of","think","through","‘have","you","heard","of","hoarding?’","‘is","that","something","you","would","think","about","asking","about?’","um","‘why","do","you","think","that","would","matter?’","you","know","like","all","that","type","of","stuff","um","you","know","somebody","who's","going","into","social","work","who","have","not","had","exposure","to","hoarding","which","is","ninety","percent","of","social","workers","out","there","just","because","it's","not","taught","in","the","curriculum","uh","you","know","your","average","kind","of","researched","based","clinical","psychologist","um","you","know","same","thing","on","that","end","um","and","then","from","there","thinking","though","like","where","are","our","gaps","is","it","dissemination","about","information","about","hoarding?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"Um
