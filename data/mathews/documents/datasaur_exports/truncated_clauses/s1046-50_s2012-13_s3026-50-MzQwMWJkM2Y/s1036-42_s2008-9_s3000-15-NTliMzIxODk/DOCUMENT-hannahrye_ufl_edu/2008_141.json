Ah man I don’t know I don’t know I think it obviously has to be part of it and you know as the world is changing but you know hold on let me give you guys an example of why I always get stuck on this um I was speaking with a woman who just completed a stent with doctors without borders and so she's working in like rural Ethiopia and this woman came to her clinic and was um crying and really really upset and was like ‘nobody can help me with my husband’ um and and it’s the way that it works in that part of Ethiopia two level homes and basement the ground floor is where all the animals would stay at night so all the goats and what not wouldn’t be picked off by wild animals um so then the family lives up on the second level and so with one woman went on to describe the fact that her husband is collecting all sorts of like containers and like extra clothing pieces and potential building supplies and like all of this stuff that when it was described to me sounds sure a lot like what my patients tend to acquire um and collect and save um and and he basically filed the entire bottom level of their home and so the reason she was upset was that they had already had like three of their goats killed because they were no longer within the protection of the of the home and so is is because of materialism?","tokens":["Interviewee:","Ah","man","I","don’t","know","I","don’t","know","I","think","it","obviously","has","to","be","part","of","it","and","you","know","as","the","world","is","changing","but","you","know","hold","on","let","me","give","you","guys","an","example","of","why","I","always","get","stuck","on","this","um","I","was","speaking","with","a","woman","who","just","completed","a","stent","with","doctors","without","borders","and","so","she's","working","in","like","rural","Ethiopia","and","this","woman","came","to","her","clinic","and","was","um","crying","and","really","really","upset","and","was","like","‘nobody","can","help","me","with","my","husband’","um","and","and","it’s","the","way","that","it","works","in","that","part","of","Ethiopia","two","level","homes","and","basement","the","ground","floor","is","where","all","the","animals","would","stay","at","night","so","all","the","goats","and","what","not","wouldn’t","be","picked","off","by","wild","animals","um","so","then","the","family","lives","up","on","the","second","level","and","so","with","one","woman","went","on","to","describe","the","fact","that","her","husband","is","collecting","all","sorts","of","like","containers","and","like","extra","clothing","pieces","and","potential","building","supplies","and","like","all","of","this","stuff","that","when","it","was","described","to","me","sounds","sure","a","lot","like","what","my","patients","tend","to","acquire","um","and","collect","and","save","um","and","and","he","basically","filed","the","entire","bottom","level","of","their","home","and","so","the","reason","she","was","upset","was","that","they","had","already","had","like","three","of","their","goats","killed","because","they","were","no","longer","within","the","protection","of","the","of","the","home","and","so","is","is","because","of","materialism?"],"metadata":[]}],[{"content":"When
