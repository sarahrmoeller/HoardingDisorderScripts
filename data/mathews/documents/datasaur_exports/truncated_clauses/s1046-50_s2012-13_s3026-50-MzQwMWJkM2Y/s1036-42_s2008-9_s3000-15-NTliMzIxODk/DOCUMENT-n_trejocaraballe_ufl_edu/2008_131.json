Um I mean so the way that we usually first we always ask if they have any difficulties with discarding um objects or belongings and if the person says yes to that we always ask for examples um what are the types of things you have difficulties discarding and um if someone were to say my Faberge eggs or (laughing) I don’t know whatever my you know my eighteen hundreds stamp collection um then we would ask the follow up question are there any other types of objects you have a hard time letting go of um so I thick there is a very obvious aspect of value that has to do with just in general with most people think that that something you should hang on to um and and if not then I kind of seeing how extensive it is like are there multiple objects um I think that’s really kind of the crux its not only that they have a hard time discarding um baggies for or the only have a hard time discarding take out containers like a hoarding patient has difficulties discarding a range of objects and again that threshold for how many of these objects they have is tends to be a lot higher then yes I sometimes save takeout containers as well but I have maybe like two of them versus you know so many
