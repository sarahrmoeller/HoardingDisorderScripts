No so I'm actually in the neuroscience department and where my side of things kind of comes in is that I’m going to be working on a project related to uh psychophysiology of hoarding disorder and so

if there are differences in um specific subgroups based on um motivations for hoarding that they have or based on degree of insight or construct of insight that more prevalent in certain subgroups and

than um I I have been in in my thinking of such a project and because I I don’t have um I I don’t have uh people power to kind of push this forward so uh everybody’s busy doing other things so yeah I mean I where my thinking was um it I'm very curious about there’s what like five groups that really understand hoarding um maybe that’s even being a little generous NAME NAME NAME and NAME (3:07-3:11)
