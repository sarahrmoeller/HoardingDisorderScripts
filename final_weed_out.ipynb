      "Interviewer: So that brings us nicely into the next section of the interview which focuses on the question of insight.\n",
      "And so, as we’ve talked about a lot of the literature surrounding hoarding disorder describes many hoarding patients as having low insight, and so the first question to start out with is how would you as a clinician define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean think that I often times define it in impairment as well.\n",
      "It’s like, are they able to recognize the level of impairment that is coming from behaviors that they’re currently engaging in?\n",
      "And if they’re not able to—let’s say it’s causing significant conflict with a spouse, they are pretty much sleeping on the floor somewhere randomly in their home and they have to wash their face at work or something like that, brush their teeth, then I would say not understanding or recognizing that these behaviors are to some degree not normal is how I kind of think about the patient’s ability to understand he repercussions of what’s happening or how it’s affecting their everyday lives.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhm, so like acknowledgement of distress.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: For the patients that you’ve seen, how much insight do they tend to have by the time they get to you?\n",
      "What level of insight do you think that most levels of patients that you’ve seen are?\n",
      "Interviewee: Let me think of some of the patients that I remember treating.\n",
      "I can think about five patients off hand and I’ve only remember one out of the five actually having poor insight.\n",
      "The others all had I think really high insight into their problems.\n",
      "Interviewer: And in your experience with the patients that you’ve seen, do you have any knowledge of how they came to gain that insight on their own or what the process was of them realizing their disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: For most of them it became impairment.\n",
      "So one lady, she had hoarded her home literally to the brim and was living in an extended stay hotel for over a year, and he was getting herself into a lot of financial difficulty because she had a monthly payment on a home she could not live in, she was paying for a hotel every single night, she had started to hoard the hotel room to the brim, and they had to obviously come and check on the room from time to time and she had been cited by them, I think, for being a fire hazard in the room.\n",
      "So, she was able to come to the conclusion for herself, “this is a problem, I need help”.\n",
      "The other lady had a conflict with her husband who was an artist, and she was having some conflict with him about the finances and the status of their home given her excessive shopping and inability to get rid of things.\n",
      "Another patient had a similar financial problem, she owned like three homes and financially was in a lot of difficulty because she had owned the homes originally to rent it out as rental properties, but then started using them as a place to store her items that she was hoarding and was not able to afford the mortgages on them without having this supplemental income.\n",
      "So, she also was kind of at the tipping point for knowing that it was an issue and needing to seek help.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So, in thinking about some of the things that we’ve been talking about up until now, so we mentioned that individuals with hoarding disorder sometimes are, for example, more socially isolated.\n",
      "The literature describes people as often being more impoverished, often being older, and I’m wondering if you think that those are real characteristics of individuals with hoarding, like people with hoarding disorder are actually more likely to be elderly or if those are just the people that are picked up because of the things that we’re talking about.\n",
      "So, I guess another way of asking this question is, is hoarding disorder more common in the elderly?\n",
      "Is it progressive over the lifespan?\n",
      "Or is it just that elderly people tend to be more socially isolated, tend to have smaller homes, and that’s why we see their hoarding symptoms?\n",
      "Does that make sense as a question?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, and that’s an important question that a bunch of people have tried to answer.\n",
      "I think it’s actually a combination of all of those things.\n",
      "(NAME, 44:00), I don’t know if you’ve already spoken with her, but she’s one of my colleagues here in (NAME, 44:06) and she has done a couple studies that have looked into this.\n",
      "So while the onset and maybe three or four different epidemiological type studies and as well as patient interview studies that looked at age of onset and age of onset usually is around age twelve or thirteen of health symptoms.\n",
      "I think it does seem progressive and I think one of (NAME, 44:28) group of grad students’ recent study showed that when they looked at decade by decade, prevalence increased, and I think that was partly because severity worsens over time especially as clutter builds up and then it creates its own problems.\n",
      "But probably also because social isolation increases, ability to clean and take care of an environment increase over time, and then other health and neurological hits occur that may exacerbate memory impairments, executive functioning problems, vascular, whatever else.\n",
      "So I think there’s a bunch of reasons why, yes, I think the prevalence does appear to increase over time and the severity increases over time.\n",
      "Perhaps people who have subclinical problems earlier now after all these things occur and they’re seventy now they’ve got fully clinical level of hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, (NAME 54:26) published a paper about the concept of insight in which he broke it down into several different constructs.\n",
      "I don’t know if you remember or are familiar with that paper.\n",
      "The constructs for hoarding disorder were defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideation, and indifference.\n",
      "I wonder if you think that these are all parts of the same sort of insight, if these are different insights, how these work together in your patients.\n",
      "I don’t know if you need me to read them again.\n",
      "Defensiveness, anosognosia, or the lack of ability to perceive the illness, overvalued ideation where you believe that the value of items is wrong or that you overvalue them, or that you’re just indifferent.\n",
      "When I was reading this paper, and this is just to move the discussion along, I was really struck by how these four constructs seem to be so different.\n",
      "So, indifference, you could imagine a patient with major depressive disorder having low insight and that they’re indifferent.\n",
      "Overvalued ideation and anosognosia almost sound more delusional, that they have beliefs that are simply not in accordance with the real world whereas defensiveness almost seems like a reaction or a behavior rather than necessarily insight itself.\n",
      "So, I don’t know, I was very struck by this paper and this breakdown and I was just kind of wondering if you had read it, if you have thought about it.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think I remember seeing it but not going through it, so I didn’t know about those four constructs or four factors that he was identifying.\n",
      "I think all of them do play a role in different patients and seeing all of those being important factors for at least some patients.\n",
      "Maybe some of them might be related to one another.\n",
      "It would be interesting to see what he found and are they really completely independent of one another or do they relate?\n",
      "And again all of them are subject to change.\n",
      "So I think that’s an important thing about insight in all of these disorders is that it’s not static at all, it changes.\n",
      "It changes with education, it changes with various realizations, it changes with experience, treatment, all of that stuff.\n",
      "I think the overvalued ideation part is really probably closer to what we think of as kind of the key level of insight into the disorder.\n",
      "Do you really believe that you need to keep the stuff because it really is super valuable and you’re getting use of all of it, or not?\n",
      "Or do you realize that in fact some of it is really stuff that you could get rid of?\n",
      "Anosognosia and indifference may be related because sometimes people have both.\n",
      "Anosognosia can be sometimes because patients will say I’ve kind of developed blindness to it.\n",
      "It’s like having a really bad smell in your home and you’ve become indifferent to the smell so you don’t even notice it but when anybody else might come in they might notice a terrible smell.\n",
      "It’s the same sort of thing.\n",
      "They’re so used to it, it becomes part of their living environment that they don’t realize how bad it is because it’s been the same for ten years and that’s what they’re used to now.\n",
      "They’re desensitized to it.\n",
      "I’ve definitely seen that in a lot of different patients.\n",
      "The total indifference to it, yeah I think you’re right, I think that probably is more related to depression.\n",
      "They realize it’s a problem but they just don’t really care and that also depends on the level of impairment and impact.\n",
      "So if they’ve got a lot of clutter but it’s really not enough to actually make a major difference in their lives it’s not preventing them from getting repairs done.\n",
      "The opinions and influence of other people in the home make a huge difference there because if someone has been yelling at you for the last five years to clean up the rid of the clutter because they can’t stand it, you’re usually not going to be indifferent to it.\n",
      "You’re going to realize that it’s causing a problem.\n",
      "My family members hate it.\n",
      "But patients will often say that, “Well I didn’t think it was a problem, but my family did so I’m going to have to do something about it.”\n",
      "So when people are isolated then there’s nobody else around to challenge that.\n",
      "They become indifferent to it.\n",
      "They got comfortable just living that way and it just wasn’t a big deal even though they’re quite aware there’s too much clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer: I just have three more questions here so I apologize.\n",
      "I know that we’re at an hour and I want to be sensitive to your time, are you okay continuing through these last couple questions?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you think of a specific case or cases that was challenging to diagnose because you felt like it was kind of on the border between pathological and normal behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say the cases that I found hard to diagnose were not so much because of the difference between normal behavior, they were more because of a question about what was the primary problem.\n",
      "Was the primary problem OCD, was the primary problem ADHD, or was the primary problem major depression?\n",
      "Where it seemed like the clutter was really just because the person had ADHD and was disorganized.\n",
      "They didn’t really endorse emotional difficulty in discarding, they didn’t get around to it, their time management was terrible, they weren’t home very much and so they just hadn’t done it.\n",
      "But when they actually had time and when they perhaps had help cleaning up, there was no urge to save the stuff.\n",
      "They knew that stuff needed to be gotten rid of or put away, but they just hadn’t done that yet.\n",
      "So it didn’t really set the criteria because yes they had clutter and it was disorganized and perhaps there was too much stuff in their home, but it wasn’t because of real emotional difficulty discarding or the need to save things because you might need them someday and all that.\n",
      "It was really just because of ADHD and disorganization and time management problems and all that stuff.\n",
      "And then other cases where it appeared to start or at least move from kind of subclinical within the normal range kind of behavior into clearly more pathological behavior only when there was a major hit.\n",
      "The patient developed a clear-cut major depression because somebody died, or they lost their job, or whatever reason they became depressed and something major changed in their lives, somebody moved out of the home and so now they were left alone.\n",
      "And then after that they basically just stopped taking care of their environment and stopped cleaning up the home, stopped throwing things out, just not really bothering, they use something they just toss it in a pile.\n",
      "It really had more to do with low motivation, low interest, an inability to take care of their environment.\n",
      "Again, not really so much because of a clear-cut urge to save or perceived need to save those items.\n",
      "So they had clutter in their homes, their homes looked like those of other people with hoarding disorder, and yet the motivations were different, the reasons were different.\n",
      "So those were the cases.\n",
      "I think in terms of differentiating from normal behavior, it’s on a continuum.\n",
      "Just like most psychiatric symptoms or syndromes are on a continuum of normal behavior and so you use the same sort of criteria as with anything else which is, is it causing distress, is it causing impairment in some area of functioning, social functioning, work functioning, family conflict, health, etc. It’s very rare in my experience that I actually come upon somebody who is right in the middle where I said, “ Oh yeah, you got some of the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but you’re not really in the clinical category.”\n",
      "That happens once in a while.\n",
      "I would say maybe once a year I might run across one of those patients where their (INAUDIBLE, 27:32) score is below forty, but it’s not really in the normal range either, it’s kind of in between a little bit.\n",
      "Sometimes patients with OCD, I’ll find them with subclinical hoarding disorder or hoarding symptoms so they wouldn’t meet criteria for hoarding disorder, but on the other hand it’s not normal either, they’re somewhere in between.\n",
      "When we recruit for people or patients get referred for treatment, they usually are much more severely affected.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, yeah.\n",
      "Because I don't keep it clean.\n",
      "You know, and I keep believing that if I could just get it cleaned up, I would keep it clean.\n",
      "And I started with the closet, and the closet was working out great, and, you know, I had the clothes, and they were all hung up, and they were in a particular order for, you know, working on whatever.\n",
      "The dresses were here, and the pants were here, and the shirts were here, and the sweaters were here.\n",
      "And I, you know, I did that about— gosh, it’s been about two years, but now I have to go back in and redo it all.\n",
      "At some point, I stopped.\n",
      "It's not immediate, but at some point I stopped.\n",
      "And I can't pinpoint when it was, but I just stopped doing it every single time.\n",
      "I wouldn't hang it up, I’d start and I’d lay it over the trunk, and then the next day I lay something else over the trunk, and then I would go and I would clean it all up, and then I’d start again, and I laid over the trunk.\n",
      "And, gosh, I mean, I just think that I'm lazy.\n",
      "I just honestly think that I'm lazy, and it drives me crazy.\n",
      "Like honestly, I don't want to be this way.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:52): Right.\n",
      "So, have you ever tried to change it?\n",
      "Like have you ever gone to a professional?\n",
      "Like a counselor or a therapist for that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, no. I mean no, I haven't.\n",
      "Um, I first have to admit that it's a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:10): Right.\n",
      "Which it sounds like you do acknowledge that it is a problem.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I do acknowledge that it is a problem, but I don't know that I'm willing to acknowledge it in a more public way.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:21): Right.\n",
      "Okay so, how do your friends and family feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Have you ever had any sort of conflict with them about it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Just my husband.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:30): Okay.\n",
      "Can you tell me a little bit about that?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Um, so the goal of cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is to reduce anxiety.\n",
      "So if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life, what would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: Uh, I, well, at least in my son’s case, I would say that, um, it could impact, if they’re at the school, it could impact their school definitely.\n",
      "That’s what I’ve seen.\n",
      "Uh, they forget, uh, what some of the important things that they need to do.\n",
      "Uh, they become less organized and uh … some parents might look at it as oh, maybe my kid uh is not that smart or you know, it-it’s um, they might miss that okay, this their grades, it’s might be something that they could address it by simple therapy.\n",
      "I think in our case, that was what I was seeing.\n",
      "My son uh is very smart and so, but then I saw his scores going down, so that was alarming and I think so what could be the problem that makes him uh, you know that uh, that has caused his grades to go down.\n",
      "So by addressing it and finding out, okay what is it that is causing it then you can uh seek the right treatment or right therapy to actually help your kid to feel good about themselves because at some point, my kid mmm could tell me oh maybe I’m not that smart or maybe this or maybe that.\n",
      "But by taking away, by helping reduce the anxiety through the therapy, then you would show the kid okay, it’s not you, or it’s not, it’s not something that um, it’s not something that you cannot fight.\n",
      "It’s something that can be addressed by simple therapy and then, because kids are going through a lot of things and you want to make sure that uh you address things that you can address.\n",
      "And then help the kids to uh actually flourish and get the confidence that they thought they don’t have it because um because what anxiety impacted in their school or in their uh, everyday um um activity that they have, with their teachers with their, you know, friends.\n",
      "So I think it’s very important that if the kid has anxiety that we diagnose and take it seriously.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay, so you first started noticing it with his, like schoolwork?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And also, you like wanted him to know that it wasn’t him, it was something outside of him that you could fix through therapy.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay.\n",
      "Um could you tell me if there are any specific skills or areas that the therapy targets?\n",
      "So like thoughts, feelings, or actions?\n",
      "Speaker: Um I feel, um, I think um feelings definitely.\n",
      "Feeling, actions, and I think all three, um get um, affected by, by the right therapy, definitely.\n",
      "And my son actually gets OT, uh occupational therapy as well.\n",
      "So, he’s, he’s doing that therapy for more than, I think, since beginning of August.\n",
      "So it’s been, it’s been four months.\n",
      "So the techniques that he’s getting from OT even though it’s not uh\n",
      "Interviewer 1: CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes (laughs) It’s still, it’s very helpful.\n",
      "So it’s helping with him becoming more organized, creating good habits.\n",
      "So in general, I think all type of therapies are good if they are um if they are addressed to the uh, to the issues parents or kids are bringing up.\n",
      "So it could be occupational therapy or it could be a therapy that helps with anxiety and many other therapies that I don’t know (laughs).\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So I know you talked about this earlier, how um the CBT has been helping him like change his thought processes.\n",
      "Speaker: Mmmhmm\n",
      "Interviewer: So, in the literature there’s been a breakdown of the concept of insight into kind of different constructs, and I’ll just read you the construct and I’d like to talk through with you if you think that these are good constructs, if you see some of them more than others, if you think that some of them are more salient at different times or different patients.\n",
      "So, one of them is defensiveness, one of them is anosognosia—total inability to perceive an illness or that something is wrong or causing a distress or reducing the quality of your life; one is overvalued ideation, the actual belief in the potential value of items, so more of a delusion sort of thing; one is indifference.\n",
      "I’ll go through the list again if that would be helpful.\n",
      "Interviewee: That would be.\n",
      "Interviewer: Defensiveness, so feeling the need to defend your behavior as a problem with insight; anosognosia, so not seeing it as an illness; overvalued ideation, or believing that, actually being more of a delusion that items are actually more valuable than they are; or being indifferent.\n",
      "So, in your experience, which of these insight-related issues is the most salient for patients with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Which is the most important for you with patients with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a good question, I’ve definitely seen the first three in patients.\n",
      "I haven’t as much seen the last one but definitely the first three.\n",
      "Overvalued ideation is definitely something that comes up, I don’t know that I ever think about it in a delusion kind of sense because I think it’s not uncommon to have some sort of an attachment to an item that maybe someone close to you gave you, but maybe, like I said, it’s more or less the number of items they apply that same concept to.\n",
      "So, it’s like the concept itself isn’t bad but it’s just the way in which they apply it is almost like overkill.\n",
      "And then I’ve definitely seen a defensive style thinking about a patient who really didn’t think she had a problem got very defensive and it was causing these issues with her daughter, felt like it was her daughter’s problem not hers, and really at all didn’t not see her behavior as an illness or problematic despite the fact that she was living in pretty severe squalor as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you try to approach a patient who has low insight, what are some of the ways in which you help a patient to gain insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I guess sometimes I try to do, in my approach, kind of like alongside of reflecting back like you don’t see this as a problem so you can’t think of ways in which this isn’t the best for you.\n",
      "So, trying to get them to illicit that kind of change talk in how maybe it is impacting them.\n",
      "Also getting at like, “so what do you think are some of the reasons that this is causing a problem for yourself?” It’s just getting them to come up with these things on their own because they’re always told it’s a problem and that it’s wrong, but it’s not a conversation.\n",
      "Interviewer (46:31): Oh no, you’re fine.\n",
      "We appreciate anything that you can give us and help us with.\n",
      "Okay, so, just a couple more questions.\n",
      "So, when you hear the words hoarding disorder.\n",
      "what comes to your mind?\n",
      "I know there's a lot of stereotypes that people associate with it.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, the worst part I’ve seen— and I try not to watch the hoarding shows because those shows are depressing to me— lot of people that hoard have things that are— [talking to someone not on the phone] it’s locked, it’s locked.\n",
      "A lot of people that hoard have like, um, broken hearts.\n",
      "[Talking to person not on the phone] Yes.\n",
      "Judy, Judy.\n",
      "I’m almost through, let me get finish with this.\n",
      "I will tell you when I'm done, okay?\n",
      "I will tell you when I'm done, please.\n",
      "Go ahead and eat, go ahead and eat, I'll be right there.\n",
      "If I could just kidding, I'm Connor, I would like, but anyway.\n",
      "If I could just get in my own car and leave, I would leave, but.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:30): Okay, so, the shows for you, those are distressing, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "And you know what, was when people fuss at me about the things I collect, it makes me want to do more.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:45): Right.\n",
      "I can, I can definitely tell for you it's, it's a big deal.\n",
      "You know, when other people try and, um, put their own values on the things that you collect.\n",
      "Alright, so, to finish up, I'm just going to ask you a few basic demographic questions.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:03): First of all, what's your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, uh, high School.\n",
      "Two weeks out of high school I went to work for [names of companies; ((48:15)].\n",
      "Two weeks out of high school, I was working.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:17): Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay, so, now I'm going to list some ranges for household incomes and if you could just go ahead and pick which one applies to your own household.\n",
      "So, they're less than $10,000, $10,000 to $20,000, $20,000 to $35,000, $35,000 to $50,000, $50,000—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The third one.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:35): Okay, so that would be 20,000 or 35,000.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:40): Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay, so next, um, which geographic region do you live in, in the US?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I live in [name of state; (48:49)].\n",
      "Interviewer (48:50): Okay, so southeast?.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay, southeast.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:55): Right.\n",
      "Okay, what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m sorry, what’d you say?\n",
      "Interviewer (48:59): What was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, female.\n",
      "Interviewer (49:03): Okay, and do you identify as female still today?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes m’am.\n",
      "Interviewer (49:09): And, what is your race or your ethnicity?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I guess I’m, I’m whiter than white baby.\n",
      "Interviewer (49:18): Okay, so Caucasian, right.\n",
      "So, you would not describe yourself as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, no, no. But I can twist my tongue the way they do.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, my sister was living with me, okay?\n",
      "And you're taking two women, and we, between the two, we had four bath– four bedrooms, and, uh, three bathrooms, okay?\n",
      "But she lived in one with me.\n",
      "She would live in mine because I had another ahead of the bedroom in a spare bathroom for her.\n",
      "But, she, she is [inaudible]… what is that word?\n",
      "Uh, [Inaudible]?\n",
      "OCD?\n",
      "Interviewer (7:28): OCD, yep.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Honey, my sister is OCD.\n",
      "She drives me crazy.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:32): Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:35): So, she's kind of a polar opposite from you in terms of keeping stuff.\n",
      "Is that what I'm hearing?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, let’s put it this way.\n",
      "She buys things and keep them maybe six, nine months, and gets rid of them.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:48): Right, yeah.\n",
      "So, for her it's not a problem at all to get rid of stuff.\n",
      "But for you, it's a little bit more difficult.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It is, and she wants me constantly to get rid of things.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:58): Okay, so I would imagine that that's definitely caused some tension between you and her.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, it does.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:05): Can you touch on that a little bit for me?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Interviewer (8:07): Can you touch on that a little bit?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, well she’s always saying, “You need to get rid of some of this shit.\n",
      "You need to get this gone.\n",
      "This is ridiculous.”\n",
      "Uh, Sunday she went out in my living room and spent four hours taking everything out, and every fifteen minutes she called me up to go, “See how good this looks?\n",
      "See how good this looks?” You know?\n",
      "Just, I, I wanted to leave the house.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:30): Right, right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And she stressed me so bad.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:34): Okay, so, it definitely stresses you out to, you know, the idea of getting rid of things.\n",
      "But, um, how severely do you react when someone tries to get rid of your stuff, or when you try yourself to get rid of things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, I get angry and I have to [inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (8:51): Okay.\n",
      "And what about the process of getting rid of stuff makes you upset?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m sorry, what’d you just say?\n",
      "Interviewer (8:59): I said, what about the process of getting rid of stuff, or someone else trying to get rid of that stuff, makes you so upset?\n",
      "What's going through your mind at that point?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, it's just like, I don’t understand.\n",
      "After my second marriage, I had to give everything back because my husband wanted me to get rid of everything.\n",
      "So, really I think most of this started when I was with my second husband because he didn't let me bring anything to the house.\n",
      "It wasn’t even as if it was my house, it was his house.\n",
      "So, it just, I just bombarded it into mine, mine, mine.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interview 018\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So that's our free listing section of the interview.\n",
      "Now we're going to move into a more, kind of, free flowing conversational proportion.\n",
      "And just to begin, I would like if you wouldn't mind for you to just give me a brief introduction of your background related to hoarding disorder, your education and how you are involved with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: A Ph.D. in Behavioral Analysis and my thesis was on hoarding in animal models, of the neural basis and evolution of hoarding in non-humans.\n",
      "And, then I studied patients with brain damage in the hospital for my fellowship after Grad school, and we studied hoarding disorder in humans in the post doc.\n",
      "And as a faculty I do research on hoarding disorder, but most of it is on individual differences in hoarding disorder, not clinical hoarding or clinical treatment, but individual differences.\n",
      "Interviewer: What do you mean by individual differences?\n",
      "Interviewee: People who are not clinically diagnosed who vary on the degree to which they express tendencies for hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Okay, that makes sense.\n",
      "That’s interesting.\n",
      "Well good, then this will be a very interesting interview, I think.\n",
      "The first part of the interview kind of examines that border between what constitutes hoarding disorder and what doesn't.\n",
      "So the first question I have for you is what in your mind are the most important differences between something that might be considered normal saving behavior?\n",
      "Or even on the extreme end of normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s normal, and everyone, to some degree, saves things they think might be useful or memorabilia.\n",
      "And I think it’s normal for people to have trouble discarding things.\n",
      "It’s like a different difficult decision process, but I think you have hoarding disorder when you actually have a full environment.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So the environment being full is what really distinguishes somebody who is just a saver who is not a clinical, not clinically diagnosed as hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So the environment itself is what distinguishes it.\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say for the most part, but I’d say someone with a clinical disorder is not receptive or malleable like, to intervention.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: So like, if it’s a person who has a hoarding tendency but they don’t have a disorder, if you went to their house and you tried to help them go through things, they can probably do it.\n",
      "But then if you go to somebody with real hoarding disorder’s house and, you know, why wouldn’t you get rid of this and this and this?\n",
      "Because, you know, you probably won’t use it.\n",
      "When’s the last time you’ve used it?\n",
      "I don’t think they’re, like, well, what’s the right word, receptive to that kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewee: They’re more resistant than a typical person.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The coat rack.\n",
      "They are hung up on the coat rack.\n",
      "There is another closet where the entryway is also jammed with lots of coats.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:19): Okay, and what kinds of things are hoarded in the house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Next to the end of the closet is a section that contains 30 or 40 years of collected audio.\n",
      "In spite of getting rid of some crates of vinyl, there are several crates of vinyl.\n",
      "There are some cassettes, several hundred CDs, and audio reproduction here in this other cabinet.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:54): Gotcha.\n",
      "And, is there like any level of organization with things that are hoarded, or is it generally just cluttered?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s like a jumble, yeah.\n",
      "Mostly a clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer (19:12): Okay, and are there any areas in the house that you can no longer use because of the clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, the basement is largely dedicated to [wife’s name; (19:28)]’s collection of recipes, and particles, and yarn for use someday.\n",
      "Interviewer (19:41): Right.\n",
      "Okay, so, there’s lots of papers and, just like, odds-and-ends and things.\n",
      "Okay, how about any appliances that you may not be able to use?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Let’s see.\n",
      "We did get the freezer out.\n",
      "That was a big accomplishment.\n",
      "Nearly 10 years nonfunctioning.\n",
      "The freezer was finally this spring removed from the basement, and we delivered it to the curb.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:15): Okay.\n",
      "Anything else on the home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Up until the COVID, we were getting rid of boxes of used clothing, but during COVID we’ve, um, the Goodwill is unable to receive drop-offs.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:38): Right.\n",
      "Okay, so, when you were getting rid of those items, was it causing you or your wife any distress?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "A form of it, but kind of just bearing down and experiencing discomfort anyway and getting it done.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:03): Okay.\n",
      "So, yes it did cause distress, but you were unable to overcome it to get rid of that stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Some of it, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:11): Right.\n",
      "Okay, what were the things that you weren’t able to get rid of?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "We still have um… scores of lineal feet of books, um, scores of lineal space for clothing, and um… we’ve got over 30 years of magazine that we’ve saved but not referred back to.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:52): Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay, so, in your home are there any rooms that are generally non-cluttered?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Hmm… the kitchen would be least cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:06): Okay.\n",
      "And what does your kitchen look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "A [inaudible]-top island in the center, fridge and microwave, one wall with cabinets and the pantry.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:26): And things are neatly organized in the pantry, and in the cupboards, and in everything?\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, the last criteria I’d like to talk about specifically reads, “This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and distress associated with discarding them.”\n",
      "I’m wondering if that distress is ever difficult to assess in the context of patients who have very low insight.\n",
      "Like how does distress and insight...\n",
      "Interviewee: Well actually what I find is the patients who have little insight are very distressed about discarding.\n",
      "The flip side is the patients who actually have good insight and now they’ve already started discarding and they like it.\n",
      "They just have trouble doing it, but they want to discard.\n",
      "So you ask them, “Well do you have distress when you try to discard?” and they’re like “No, no I want to.\n",
      "I know that I have way too much stuff and my distress is whenever I think about the clutter and all kinds of problems it’s causing me and the fact that my husband is threatening to leave me because of it.”\n",
      "So the distress is now caused by the clutter.\n",
      "So it really completely depends on what’s going on with that person and the level of insight.\n",
      "The people that you see that don’t have any insight at all, they deny that there’s a problem.\n",
      "They say, “No no no that’s all my stuff.\n",
      "Don’t touch it.\n",
      "I’m fine with it.\n",
      "It’s not causing me any difficulty” and they certainly would be very distressed if you made them throw anything out because from their standpoint it’s all of the stuff they need, they want to keep it all.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it’s interesting because clinicians will often say you know that it’s hoarding disorder if it’s getting in the way of their life or if the person is distressed by it.\n",
      "But often what they mean is those people are not actually distressed by their behavior at all, they’re very distressed by discarding, but they’re not distressed by their own behavior.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yup and that was a big debate and that’s where there were (INAUDIBLE, 47:10) and I disagreed because they were kind of writing the criteria and I think even one of their own rating scales, hoarding rating scales, that kind of implies that everybody with hoarding disorder has poor insight and doesn’t want to discard.\n",
      "And I said no, everybody who comes into our research studies and clinic they all have good insight and they want to discard they just have trouble doing it.\n",
      "And this battle of going back and forth because some of them feel like they want to keep most of it or some of them realize I don’t need to keep much of anything but I just don’t know how to decide or I’m quite aware that I don’t need all of this stuff, but it’s completely overwhelming and so I put it off and procrastinate.\n",
      "So I think it was because we were seeing sort of different segments of the population.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you explain what you mean?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, there was this idea that if you had insight into it or somehow you’re not bothered by the attempts to discard it, you don’t have hoarding disorder.\n",
      "I said, “No that’s definitely not the case.”\n",
      "That issue is what exactly causes distress, is it clutter itself or is it trying to get rid of the clutter?\n",
      "That depends on insight.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, yeah that’s a good transition.\n",
      "Now I'd like to talk a little bit about the DSM-5 criteria.\n",
      "So you mentioned the difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value.\n",
      "I'm wondering again, in these cases, you know, in some cases people are saving things that are clearly like trash, but how do you go about determining their actual value?\n",
      "So again, in a case where people are saving things that, you know, it could potentially have value or they are, you mentioned earlier in the free list, like collectors items.\n",
      "How do you decide if, how do you use that value criteria in the DSM-5 criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, there’s a lot of objects in hoarding where, like you paid money for it, but then as a used item, it’s almost worthless.\n",
      "So, like a binder at Staples could be like 9.99, but if you try to sell it on EBay, you’ll probably get thirteen cents.\n",
      "Nobody would even buy it.\n",
      "So, like, there’s hundreds of those binders at the salvage mart because people have so many, they’re like super abundant.\n",
      "So, like, even though you bought something for money, doesn’t mean it has value once you’ve already bought it and used it, or even not used it.\n",
      "So, like, I think of it in terms of retail value.\n",
      "So, like, if you tried to, like, it’s like a market force, right?\n",
      "So, things that are little to no value, is, to me, in the eye of the market.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So literal—\n",
      "Interviewee: So, if they wanted to sell it, would they get really money for it that would be the [INAUDIBLE 15:49) of lunch more than like, pocket change.\n",
      "Interviewer: Again, I know that this is not a typical thing that you see, but would it be possible for somebody to hoard items that did have resale value?\n",
      "Like hypothetically, they filled their whole house and they have no usable space but they’ve filled it with, you know, like Picasso's or whatever and they can't move in their house and it's just stacked floor to ceiling.\n",
      "But the items that they're hoarding are actually objectively valuable.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that is extremely rare…\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewee: … to think this, this extremely rare, it’s certainly not like, very typical case.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Okay, that makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "The only cases I can think of is when like, it would be in somebody’s, almost job or life’s work, to acquire and sell those items.\n",
      "Like if you’re the Picasso, and you have all these paintings, you might have a house full of paintings, right?\n",
      "Because you painted them and it’s your job to sell them.\n",
      "Or, if you’re a guy that fixes people’s stereos, you’d have like half used stereos all over your house, but it’s part of how you earn your living or your identity.\n",
      "So, it’s like, it’s sensible.\n",
      "I wouldn’t call that hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: Even if it substantially compromises the intended use of the space?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I would say [INAUDIBLE 17:15), like there’s some, like, magical case where it has no bearing on their life, and now, I just think it’s like so unlikely, I’ll just sign off.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay. Um, and what’s your involvement in his therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: So for him, um so I propose occupational therapy and the therapy he’s getting for his anxiety so I, I would remind him (laughs) I have the job of reminding him, for example, he has a routine that he needs to follow at night and in the morning so I, I would remind him.\n",
      "And I would ask him about the situation at his school, if there was any situation that he felt like that okay, he’s very stressed out, he has uh he has difficulty conducting his thought.\n",
      "So I would ask him of the situation that I think might make him anxious.\n",
      "So um, so I think parents needs to be involved, definitely, because um kids are being kids.\n",
      "They might um forget so by being involved and being like a someone that could remind or um, ask them uh what different things happened at the school, especially if they’re at the school.\n",
      "Then I think, they could uh create conversation and find out okay, if the therapy’s working or not because um, then they can address it the next session with the therapy and give feedback, what has been work, what has not been work.\n",
      "And they can um modify if it needs to be modified.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Right, so you would just want other parents to know that they should remind their children, um check in on them, see how they’re doing, so that they can make sure that there’s progress.\n",
      "Speaker: Exactly, because I think, especially if the kids are young, I know that if they are, let’s say, in elementary school, I’m sure the parents are going to be so involved but say even in middle school and high school, um you might say oh our kids are uh independent but still they need uh us to be um to be there to supervise and help them uh in any way that we can.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So, parent involvement and support is vital?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay.\n",
      "Um, have you heard or read any scientific research about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Do you think this is something we should talk about in the video?\n",
      "Speaker: Uhh, well I think it would help because for me like still I have a hard time saying anxiety is CBT, you know, or the therapy that he’s getting is considered to be.\n",
      "I think, yeah, I think for maybe a little bit talking about what is it and make it very simple that um it’s not like a [\n",
      "] it’s like um … It’s hard to understand.\n",
      "I think it has to be very simple, especially if it’s going to be uh in videos to be something simple that both parents and you know uh kids would understand and they’ll know later oh this is something uh, you know sometimes, um, I don’t know how to put it.\n",
      "Um, there are some phrases that you go oh that should be so difficult to understand but then when you look at it and you analyze it, it’s so simple.\n",
      "So it’s a mouthful, CBT, so someone might think this is so, something hard to understand but if you make it, break it down what does it mean and give some simple examples maybe that will be helpful.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Right, so just everyday language that anyone can understand.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yes, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay um did you know about anybody else’s experience with CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Hmmm … No, other than my daughter and my son, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay.\n",
      "Um, so now we get to transition to the part of the interview where we actually talk about how the video will look like.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah, yeah.\n",
      "You know, you think this person might come into your house and you think, god I would have to get rid of a bunch of stuff for him to come in and it’s embarrassing to me.\n",
      "And, I wouldn’t want him to open up my closet doors, my pantry, anything.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:29): Mhmm.\n",
      "So, what about your sister?\n",
      "Does she ever have people over?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, well, you know, with all this stuff going on, the only person that has been over in, in two months is just my niece and mother.\n",
      "But, that’s the two that are hoarders also.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:44): Okay, so it's not a problem for them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s not a problem, no.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:47): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, not really for them, no. Now, when I go to my niece’s house and my, uh, her mother's house, it is almost a panic to me if I go in there.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:58): Really?\n",
      "Participant 054 (28:00)\n",
      "Yeah, because the stuff they have in theirs’s is ten times worse than what I have in mine.\n",
      "Interviewer (28:07): Okay, in what way?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, she has a little— my niece, my niece has a breakfast nook.\n",
      "And, uh, there’s, there’s supposed to be a table in there, but she has, she has, uh, four [inaudible; (28:20)] of stuff she’s got packed in there.\n",
      "Her bills are in there, and I don't know how she even looks at it or what she’s got to pay.\n",
      "Uh, she's got tons of things in her dining room.\n",
      "Her little, uh, [inaudible; (28:30)] was supposed to be like an office where the kids could do their schoolwork.\n",
      "You can't even see in that room.\n",
      "Interviewer (28:37): Because there's so much stuff like, packed up?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "She has one of those big soaker tubs in her bathroom in her bedroom.\n",
      "And it’s filled to the top with stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (28:48): Wow.\n",
      "Like what kinds of stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It's everything.\n",
      "It’s backpacks, um, sometimes it’s clothes… it could be her dresser from her bedroom.\n",
      "I don’t even know how she picks out her choice.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:01): Right.\n",
      "So, just—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But, this is for me.\n",
      "You go ahead and I’ll let you— [Talking to someone else not on the phone] Wait just a minute, let me finish this.\n",
      "I’ll talk to you afterwards because I’m talking to [inaudible].\n",
      "No, no, no. It's about me.\n",
      "It's about me.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I will come on a minute, just go ahead and order what you want.\n",
      "Okay… Um, how much more time do we have to do this?\n",
      "Interviewer (29:31): Um, usually it's a sixty-minute interview.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:37): If that's all right with you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:39): I mean, it might be like a little bit less, maybe like fifty minutes.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:44): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because my sister’s spazzing on me.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:47): No worries.\n",
      "Yeah, I'll try and move quickly.\n",
      "No worries at all.\n",
      "Interviewer: Awesome and what would be useful for other parents to know that maybe have a child that is about to go into CBT or is in CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Be patient.\n",
      "Love your child no matter what.\n",
      "Sometimes we are the cause of some of their problems and we don’t realize it and hopefully the therapist or the counselor would let us know somehow.\n",
      "Although there have been certain times where I would say something or do something I meant it in a way to keep my child safe or I’m trying to protect her from something, but she doesn’t have that perspective.\n",
      "She feels like she is being restricted or um that I’m being mean to her and so her counselor knew after talking with me individually sometimes with my daughter in the therapy and me out in a separate room quickly, I would let her know what my perspective was and she knew I wasn’t trying to be a jerk.\n",
      "I was trying to do the right thing for my child.\n",
      "So that helped her be able to help my daughter realize that I was coming from a place of concern and she was possibly you know you got let the child feel the way they are going to feel, but help them realize that the parent has a different view of things and has different experiences and is trying to be helpful.\n",
      "It opens up communication between the parent and the child.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "So would you say it would be useful for parents to know to have open communication between the child and the therapist?\n",
      "To be patient and stuff like that.\n",
      "Speaker: And if they have concerns that the therapist needs to know about to make sure that they are not afraid to talk to the therapist or you know to just you know touch them on the shoulder or something and say can I talk to for just a minute.\n",
      "Tell me if I’m taking this the wrong way and it’s helpful for both the child and the parent.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah definitely.\n",
      "And have you read or heard any scientific research that has mentions CBT, and if so or if not do you think this something useful for us to mention in our videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Research on CBT.\n",
      "I don’t think I have which is unusual for me actually.\n",
      "Um would it be useful?\n",
      "It is always useful to back up what you say with research.\n",
      "You don’t necessarily need to say Millers, Smith, and Johnson at al. 1996 and their landmark study.\n",
      "You don’t have to cite it that way but in literature maybe suggest sources, reputable websites, and reputable sources of information whether it’s printed or electronic that parents and/or kids can look at.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: That’s always useful.\n",
      "Always whatever you do, I’m a scientist, you have to back up your claims otherwise its one person’s opinion versus another.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah definitely and did you know about anybody else’s experiences of CBT any time in your life?\n",
      "Speaker: No\n",
      "Interviewer: No, ok\n",
      "Speaker: I only… I landed into CBT myself actually because I voluntarily went to Vista for three days.\n",
      "I needed a time out because I was really going downhill fast so and um I actually found that I could help other people, other women who were struggling with suicidal thoughts.\n",
      "I didn’t know DBT, but I had some encouraging books that they could look at and things that were able to enhance sort of their view of themselves.\n",
      "Interviewer psychology stuff so.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so as I mentioned before we want to develop these video about CBT so we are kind of going to move on talking a little bit more detail about those.\n",
      "So, thinking about the video, who would be in the video in your perspective?\n",
      "What characters do you think we should include?\n",
      "Speaker: What ages groups are you targeting?\n",
      "Interviewer: So as of right now we are trying to make the video appeal to both the patients and their family so pretty much all age groups, but um yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: And is it just one video?\n",
      "Interviewer: As of right now.\n",
      "Interviewer: If you could think through for me—so we’re going to move onto the next set of questions.\n",
      "The next set of questions are kind of about the DSM-5 criteria and we’re going to go into a little bit more detail about the criteria themselves.\n",
      "It sounds like you’ve applied these criteria to patients or you have applied them with the intent of diagnosis.\n",
      "Are there particular elements of the criteria themselves that you think are particularly difficult to apply or that perhaps different clinicians might apply differently?\n",
      "Maybe things to do with the language?\n",
      "Or things that are related to clinical judgement?\n",
      "Interviewee: Let me think about that for a second, that’s a good question.\n",
      "Obviously, I guess addressing impairment, for one, can be hard because the patients often times don’t acknowledge the impairment and don’t see it necessarily—which is really those that derive kind of joy or pleasure from their behaviors of acquiring and that sort of thing, and obviously find it negative to discard or find that to be distressing.\n",
      "So, I think the insight a little bit, like you kind of mentioned earlier, could be one issue with hoarding that is hard.\n",
      "I was surprised when the DSM came out that there was excessive acquisition as a specifier.\n",
      "This is my personal anecdotal evidence of treating patients and interviewing a lot of hoarders, but I have never personally come across anyone who did not have this acquiring problem or piece, and I’ve oftentimes wondered, diagnostically and from a research perspective, whether or not people who don’t have this acquiring piece if it’s really hoarding what we’re seeing or more like some sort of anhedonia or just general, kind of like [INAUDIBLE 17:48] as to why they’re not cleaning up.\n",
      "Because for most individuals with hoarding disorder, there is always an acquisition piece present, it’s not something that would just be a specifier, there is this kind of pleasure or joy that’s derived from buying things or collecting things or obtaining free things, and it would be hard for me to imagine an instance in which hoarding occurs without some sort of acquisition.\n",
      "Speaker: So this part is going to, so you guys going to have the different version for different group age?\n",
      "So it’s not… it’s going to be one for every group age can watch?\n",
      "33:34-Transcripted by Aqueena\n",
      "Interviewer: So I think we’re going to have one set of videos for children, and we’re still deciding if we’re going to make a separate set for parents.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay… well I think I like the third one.\n",
      "Interviewer: The third one?\n",
      "Speaker: The comic, yeah.\n",
      "Because with the first and second one, I feel like it’s going to be hard to target all the kids.\n",
      "Let’s say if you make something, it’s so hard to cover all ages.\n",
      "It might satisfy one age group, the first one, but especially the second one, I feel like it makes it so limited.\n",
      "It would be harder to connect with older ages.\n",
      "The first one I think you could have for kids in middle school age and have the scenario or another frame of video that is older kids, because it’s going to be difficult to target things that make both middle school and high school kids anxious.\n",
      "But for comic, I think it’s everyone, every age who can relate to it, and it makes it a little easier to make something that kids from elementary school, middle school, and high school can watch without feeling like, “Oh, it’s not for my age.”\n",
      "So that’s my thought.\n",
      "I think comic would make it a little bit easier to target all groups, all age groups.\n",
      "Whereas the second one I think is especially for older kids.\n",
      "The first one is fine I think, but I like the third one.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Finally, what do you think the take home message for the video should be?\n",
      "Speaker: It shouldn’t be something that parents feel like, “Oh there is something else I need to be worried about.”\n",
      "It should be something like, “Oh!\n",
      "That’s something I can make them feel like they want to do it!” they don’t feel like, “Oh, this is something else that needs planning of what I’m going to do,” because as parents, we have so many thing that we need to think about.\n",
      "So, if we make this something that’s going to be beneficial, it doesn’t really require a lot of planning from parents, then it makes it a lot easier.\n",
      "It makes it a lot more appealing for them to go and actually seek the help that is going to be available.\n",
      "I think that’s very important.\n",
      "So for me, if it’s something like, “Oh, I have to plan for it.\n",
      "Oh, I have to do this,” then I’m less likely to take the initiative.\n",
      "Whereas if it’s something simple like, “Oh!\n",
      "Everything is going to be there.\n",
      "Yes, I’m going to have some engagement, yes I’m going to be there, but most of it is going to be done through the therapy and by going every week or every two weeks, you’re going to actually check the progress.\n",
      "It’s not just going to be you feeling like, “Okay, am I seeing the progress or not?” it’s a collaboration, with the parent and the doctor or therapist.”\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so just get them excited for therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: Get them excited for therapy, not for them to feel like, “This is something extra you need to think about or plan for.”\n",
      "Make it easy.\n",
      "The second thing would be, just make it so that kids don’t feel like there’s something wrong with them which is why their parents are taking them to the doctor.\n",
      "No, no, no, it’s not like that.\n",
      "It’s like the way that teachers are helping us to grow academically and personally, so the therapist is going to help us in different aspects of our lives that we need help.\n",
      "Interviewer: Is your sense that people are actually afraid of losing the memory and forgetting if they get rid of the item?\n",
      "Like they think that the memory will be gone and they will forget the memory or is it--?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis I actually did a memory [INAUDIBLE 47:57] and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there.\n",
      "But there is this fear of forgetting or not remembering something.\n",
      "Interviewer: That is so interesting.\n",
      "I don’t think that’s ever come up in an interview before but that is, I think that brings very true...it’s something that nobody else has picked up on and something that I’d like to talk to you about.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, it’s definitely fascinating.\n",
      "I did a verbal [INAUDIBLE 48:26] test where there were asked to recite items and even like a 20-minute delay when I go back and reassess these 20 items that they’re told to remember, and it was fascinating to see time and time again hoarders—because that’s who I recruited for my thesis—just like remember every single item I had said.\n",
      "But it also makes sense to me because they can remember where an item is in their home even if it’s buried among like, I mean I can barely find my keys and my home is really organized, and they can tell you where this random sheet of paper is.\n",
      "Interviewer: But for you and your experience with these patients at the same time they have kind of a fear of losing memories.\n",
      "Do you feel like, so we talked a little bit about this inappropriate valuation kind of inability to distinguish between things that are valuable and things that are less valuable, do you think that that extends to memories as well?\n",
      "That they have trouble distinguishing between things that that should be remembered and things that are able to be forgotten?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, yeah, I don’t think I’ve ever thought about that but yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting, that was really interesting, I unfortunately am at the end of my time with you today, but I would love to continue this conversation.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I can understand that.\n",
      "So, just to repeat back and make sure that I’ve got what you’re saying, it seems like there needs to be a piece that involves taking pleasure in items and in acquiring them and in having them, and not simply an inability to discard or clean up, that distinguishes the behaviors associated with hoarding disorder from the behaviors associated with, say somebody who’s badly depressed and who simply can’t get up and clean their house.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.\n",
      "So, without that piece there to me it’s not hoarding, although according to the DSM, excessive acquisition is actually a specifier but it’s not a requirement and so that’s been one thing that’s been somewhat hard for me to kind of wrap my head around.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes total sense.\n",
      "Okay and now I’m going to read you a couple of the phrases from the criteria and I’d just like you to kind of talk through to me your thought process as you apply it to individual patients and I have some questions about them.\n",
      "So, one of the things that we’re interested in hearing about is this phrase, “persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value.”\n",
      "What we’re interested in is kind of how you determine actual value, like what makes a value judgement in a person with hoarding disorder inappropriate?\n",
      "Is it like a monetary?\n",
      "How do you determine if an emotional valuation is an inappropriate emotional valuation?\n",
      "How do you determine if an aesthetic valuation is an inappropriate aesthetic valuation?\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, so I guess you don't see the anosognosia.\n",
      "That's a question I ask because some clinicians will describe that like patients will look at their space and be clutter blind, that they'll be unable to see the space for what it really is, and that almost sounds like, maybe not a delusion maybe that's too strong, but that's like an inability to perceive the reality of their situation and I wonder if you see that at all with your patients, or if you see it as maybe less common that patients really can't see the clutter?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think the it can happen, but being in treatment is like a selection bias, when someone is in treatment, and in particular if you're doing home visits with them because you're there is a novel, a new set of eyes, it makes them see it too.\n",
      "But I think when people aren not in treatment and they're sort of in their day to day lives, they don't see it.\n",
      "They don't pay attention to it or they purposely let it slide out of their mind of they're acclimated to it so much they you know, they just don't notice it.\n",
      "But I do think when you go to someone's house with them, then they notice it because they're paying attention.\n",
      "It's probably more that they're just not paying attention day to day because they're acclimated and it doesn't jump out at them because they're so used to it.\n",
      "So, I do think maybe they're onto something in the article, but the people who are coming to treatment, it's either a selection bias or something about the treatment that sort of breaks through that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you ever encountered in your practice an individual with animal hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: I have not, no.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So, at what kind of stage of insight or how much insight do patients tend to have when you see them?\n",
      "So on your first visit with a patient, at what level of insight do they tend to be?\n",
      "Interviewee: That's a good point, if they're having me come over, then they have sufficient insight to recognize that it's at least something that they want to involve a professional at.\n",
      "So, they have probably a little bit better insight than the folks who are not in treatment, so I would say they're insight is maybe moderate.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what are some of the things that you talk about with patients or that you do with patients to help them to gain insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, I know there's like visualization exercises that we can do to like imagine things being different or ask them if the clutter wasn't an issue for them, what would their life look like to try to get at what the clutter is blocking them from, or what would be different if the clutter weren't there, to try to have something to move towards.\n",
      "I guess that's more motivation than insight.\n",
      "Insight might be more gained by sort of asking like, \"Well what do other people tell you about this?\n",
      "Or what do other people say to you?\" Things like that, or if the person is bizarre to other people, if the person is avoiding having people over, we ask them, \"Why?\n",
      "What would someone else say?\" Often people are embarrassed about having so much clutter, but the embarrassment comes from some part of them knows that it's not such a socially acceptable thing if they're embarrassed by it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Now I’d like to talk through the DSM-5 criteria a little bit more specifically.\n",
      "Are there particular elements of these criteria that you regard as particularly difficult to apply or that you have ever thought different clinicians may apply differently or have to do with clinical judgement?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I mean I’m biased because I wrote the first chapter of the criteria in my office a few years ago and then worked on the committee with the DSM-5 that worked on these criteria ten years ago or eight years ago.\n",
      "So I think that generally they’re pretty good, I think the field tests have been pretty good in terms of their validity and their usability and the interrater reliability was actually pretty good for hoarding disorder as compared to mood disorders and anxiety disorders.\n",
      "But I think a lot of people may get confused or misdiagnose people simply because they just don’t really get the phenomenology that much, they just haven’t had experience diagnosing this disorder or working with patients with the disorder because the patients may be really not very good historians.\n",
      "Until you actually really sit down and go into it with them you may not be able to really elicit why is it that they’re saving stuff and do they have emotional difficulty discarding and because the interview sometimes can be difficult.\n",
      "Sometimes the patients are really tangential and overinclusive and long-winded so they’re diverting it.\n",
      "Sometimes they don’t really want to talk about that issue.\n",
      "Sometimes they lack insight into what’s actually driving their own behavior.\n",
      "So I think it probably can be difficult and it really does depend on how much training and clinical experience the person has or how much exposure they might have had to people with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "People who are seeing a hoarding patient for the first time may not really know what to do or how to assess for it because it hasn’t been included in training programs up until just a couple of years ago.\n",
      "So there’s plenty of, probably most of, mental health clinicians out there who still really don’t know how to assess hoarding disorder patients or to make the diagnosis or apply the diagnostic criteria well because they’ve just never had the training.\n",
      "Speaker: So… as we’ve worked our way through the therapy sometimes the things have changed or new things have come in and as a parent I already see her navigate.\n",
      "She uses- applies some of the same techniques almost naturally now, so it’s to the point where we’ve even gone through period- long periods of time where we weren’t coming and… we’re back and it’s been short, sweet and sort of quick just like in some ways a refresher.\n",
      "But she, you know, she’s an adolescent now so she’s a lot different than she was 4 years ago and is in all kinds of different situations.\n",
      "Does that answer your question?\n",
      "Interviewer: You did, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah no. You talked about, you know, before doing therapy you said they kind of talked about the different paths you could take, they talked about the fear hierarchy, and then I think you mentioned with the rainbow.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I forgot what it was.\n",
      "Lightning and rainbows?\n",
      "I don’t remember.\n",
      "Something like that.\n",
      "I remember but it really, for me and I remember really my daughter too, it was- for us it seemed to put it kind of into oh here’s the plan, here’s what we’re doing.\n",
      "Here’s where you might be right now but if you continue doing this it will be over time.\n",
      "To-at the beginning I was like wow this is really intense and intensive.\n",
      "When we were about to do something like the camp where it was like she went in whatever it was 5 days insanely panicked about some things.\n",
      "Then by the 5th day she was just like here go ahead give me a shot and she actually did it that day, you know, whereas there were no immunizations before that.\n",
      "There was no finger pricks.\n",
      "There was a [12:58]\n",
      "of staff, you know, trying to get to her, get her to calm down.\n",
      "There was avoiding doctor’s appointments, there was- it was just crazy.\n",
      "It was just crazy how intense it was to just in a quick period of time and that was just one of her things in her fear hierarchy but things that really affected her daily life not even just doctor stuff but just in that short week so many things because it was so intensive.\n",
      "It was day after day working really really hard so…\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like you’re saying that knowing the- having the visual representation was helpful to kind of know what to expect and also being able to know the different paths you can take were helpful.\n",
      "Speaker: Right.\n",
      "Yeah, you can do something intensive that’s shorter and I would hopefully assume that other people have those kind of responses.\n",
      "I can only say what we had or, you know, that if that’s not possible having… and I think it worked well to- we usually have some sort of homework type thing to do and so you’re still working in between your sessions or can be working in between your sessions.\n",
      "But then yeah, spreading it out over more time so it’s not… benefit both ways.\n",
      "Yeah, there are different paths you could go.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "It sounds like so- I know it might be difficult to think back 4 years ago.\n",
      "So it sounds like there were some things that they talked about that really helped you.\n",
      "Was there anything that you wish you had known that maybe you found out later.\n",
      "Then if you think about it, you’re like well I wish we had known this when we first started.\n",
      "And if you don’t that’s okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Like do I, do I love it?\n",
      "And secondary to that would be, what is its, what is its monetary value.\n",
      "Because some of these skeins were extremely expensive.\n",
      "But that's kind of secondary to it.\n",
      "Really, I'm trying to only keep the things, the yearn anyways, that are giving me pleasure.\n",
      "Either through feel or through color, through vision.\n",
      "And, somebody told me something once and I'm trying, I'm trying really hard to live by it.\n",
      "Which is, you know, use what you have.\n",
      "Because I have a tendency to save it for something special, or save it for future use, when in fact the sheep are still growing.\n",
      "The fiber.\n",
      "And people are still spinning it, and people are still dyeing it.\n",
      "So, if I use it up, there'll be more to replace it.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:39): Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But, but I think that's how I got into this, this having so much, was that I was afraid to keep using.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:50): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And then I would buy more, and that's just ridiculous.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:55): So, I noticed you said earlier that, um, it's pretty common for people that are in this craft to have and collect all of these yarns like you.\n",
      "What would you say are some differences between what's considered normal saving behavior, like if someone else were a knitter and they had, you know, a bunch of yarns, and your own behavior, in terms of collecting things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… I don't know that there is a lot of difference.\n",
      "I think one of the differences might be that I held on to some of the cheap crappy yarn longer than I should have, and I need to just give it away.\n",
      "Because I by no means have the largest yarn stash I have ever seen.\n",
      "By no means.\n",
      "But I do have a stash of crappy Hobby Lobby, Joann Fabrics-type acrylic yarns that I will never, ever, ever knit with.\n",
      "And I need to just, I need to just— and that’s what I started giving away.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:09): Okay, so for you the difference between normal saving and what would be considered like, clutter problems is saving things that aren't entirely useful?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, or not— or, or have no perceived value in my mind.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:25): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know we, we talked about things like being a yarn snob or depending on, you know whatever, whatever your craft or hobby or your passion is.\n",
      "You know, you always want to have the best of it.\n",
      "And there's always going to be something that you look down your nose at and say, well, I would never use that, or I would never wear that.\n",
      "Then why keep it?\n",
      "Interviewer (37:48): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And I have kept it.\n",
      "And so that would be, that to me would be the biggest gap between the two.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you think of a specific case or an example of a patient where it was challenging to diagnose them, because it was on the border between pathological and non-pathological behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, actually I can.\n",
      "I have a patient that I saw for a fair amount of time who definitely met for hoarding disorder in the sense that she had difficulty discarding or parting with some possessions.\n",
      "She definitely had this perceived need to save things and had substantial acquiring habits where she was shocked and she wasn’t [INAUDIBLE 12:49] and so it was interesting to me to treat her because for her everything truly had some sort of value—it could be used in some sort of way, and she kind of looked at things in a different light than I probably do.\n",
      "I would say that out of all the people that I’ve worked with, her home was probably, for the most part I mean, could be used completely like she could sit on her couch, they could use their kitchen, her and her husband, they could sleep on their bed.\n",
      "They did have one or two rooms that were pretty sealed in terms of clutter with things she was like collecting her art stuff and things she would buy to potentially use in the future for art-related projects that she admitted that she would never likely start.\n",
      "But for her the impairment was coming from the fact that it was causing significant problems with her and her husband, because one: she was spending money that they often times didn’t have, and two: he did not like the fact that some of the rooms were already cluttered to the point of non-use.\n",
      "But she was definitely a little bit more I guess on the fence in terms of being as severe as other people I have seen but also still technically to some degree really meeting for the disorder based on self-report.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, for you the way that you made that distinction was that you took the cue from her in terms of her self-report of impairment or her self-report of distress.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, yeah for some part some impairment was very much self-reported in the sense that I did not know personally about her finances and never interacted with her or her husband in the room in a therapy session.\n",
      "But those are things that she was reporting to me and being kind of the catalyst, you know the call for change or want to change with regard to the behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so, in terms of making the clinical distinction—even though it was kind of border line because she was self-reporting impairment—you went with her take on the situation.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I mean I knew, given what she was presenting with, that that was the kind of reel on what she would fit diagnostically and I often times think about how would I treat this patient without necessarily making a clinical decision about a disorder—particularly when it can be a little bit, you know, maybe differentially, diagnostically could be a differential diagnostic question.\n",
      "I’ll think about what are the presenting symptoms, what are maybe the underlying factors and how would I treat them; so, for her it seemed like that would be the treatment that I would use.\n",
      "Interviewer: So very few borderline cases in your experience.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I don’t see much that, that really falls in the borderline range of this kind of thing, you know.\n",
      "People that I end up dealing with, it’s pretty clear that it’s a significant problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what about cases that were on the border with other mental health problems, such as perhaps depression or OCD.\n",
      "So…\n",
      "Interviewee: There’s considerable overlap.\n",
      "An awful lot of the people with hoarding also have significant depression.\n",
      "They may well have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\n",
      "They may well have other anxiety disorders that may come to attention first.\n",
      "I mean, they may come in because they are presenting with an anxiety problem, then you discover they’ve also got a hoarding problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: So these, these disorders are common, and do you ever feel like it's difficult to determine if somebody is primarily suffering from hoarding disorder or if for example, they're severely depressed and are just unable to clean up their space, does that ever become an issue for you and your practice?\n",
      "Interviewee: The thing, realistically, I think they’re at the point where I think they’ve got a real hoarding problem.\n",
      "Comorbid problems like depression are there, but I don't think it's the that hoarding problem is secondary to the depression.\n",
      "I think, actually, may well run the other direction.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So their primary problem might actually be depression.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about the distinction between Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "And as you mentioned, that's a fairly recent conceptual distinction and I wonder how you see that play out in your own practice or if you think it’s a valid distinction to be made.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think it’s a valid distinction and, again, in the past we used to consider hoarding just a variation of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\n",
      "The thing is that, realistically, some people you see with hoarding don’t have other kinds of things that look like OCD at all.\n",
      "I mean we don’t have the clear obsessions about any topic other than their possessions.\n",
      "They don’t have distinctive compulsions other than collecting or sorting or hoarding things.\n",
      "Or then you also run into people that have very typical symptoms of OCD with a contamination of fears or karma obsessions or whatever else, and typical OCD-like compulsive behaviors other than hoarding, so you know they’re watchers or checkers, or, you know, they’re doing mental rituals or whatever.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it seems like with that it is, in your mind, they are different, but they often can co-occur, although they can occur separately as well.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: How often would you say that they co-occur?\n",
      "Just again, this is not, we're not trying to get statistically significant, we're just asking people about their experiences with their patients that they find that it's very common in the patient populations that they see to have it overlap with OCD symptoms or if in their experience, it’s to be expected.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I, I think maybe 20-25% of people with hoarding are also people with OCD, I don’t…You know, I…That’s a guess.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, sure.\n",
      "That’s all we’re looking for, just to, you know, get people’s kind of subjective experience with treating this disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Okay. And do you ever think that, perhaps there are cultural forces associating one sense of value and self worth with consumption or ownership of material possessions and that that plays into the development of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "So the idea that, you know, one is a more valuable or more worthy person when one owns more valuable things are one, one has nice things.\n",
      "Do you feel like that's a part of it?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Like, I mean I think like the American culture shifted after like the post industrialization and then they have all these things that culture promoted for people to have to be fancy like China and our collections of things and collectors items.\n",
      "And those were things that society really created a drive for that are, that’s just fairly like inherent to life and culture.\n",
      "And to some extent we're still living with that, but to that general, like, ethos we've added super abundance of goods.\n",
      "I think that is actually like the most compathic factor.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "And what about the relationship between hoarding behaviors and memory?\n",
      "So you mentioned earlier that people with hoarding disorder will say that they are saving things so they don't forget an event.\n",
      "What do you think, what do you think is the relationship between the behavior and the sense of memory or what people think about memory?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t think it’s as strong as other factors.\n",
      "I think that there can be things that are memorabilia that people keep.\n",
      "But that’s not, like, the majority of items when there’s like a problem.\n",
      "That’s probably like a majority.\n",
      "It might be like almost a majority of items than a regular person, but that's, true memorabilia is not going to create hoarding disorder because there's just not enough of those items.\n",
      "But, and somebody might keep things like paperwork and bills so that they could like look it up later if they need to.\n",
      "Or like coupons, like kind of paperwork stuff people hold onto.\n",
      "But again, I, or like an article, they want to remember to show someone.\n",
      "But again, I don't think that's like a majority of items or like just like the defining reasons.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So it might be a part of why people might say that they save things, but you don't think that, for example, people with hoarding disorders are more anxious about their memories or feel like they have poor memories or anything like that?\n",
      "Interviewee: There was a research study that said they do think they have poor memories.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "And, but in your experience, it’s not every patient.\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t think it’s like, a requisite necessary or sufficient.\n",
      "052\n",
      "Interviewer (5:16): Okay. Alright, so this next part of the interview is going to be more like a general conversation.\n",
      "I’m going to start out by asking you if you could describe your problems with clutter for me.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Describe my clutter problems?\n",
      "Interviewer (5:33): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I, uh, exceeded in my workspace and I’m surrounded by one, two, three, four, five, six file cabinets and storage units about them.\n",
      "In my storage, some of the file cabinets are open.\n",
      "The floor is covered with different piles of different files.\n",
      "And, um, it would be very hard for me to tell someone what to do with this stuff if I was unable to return to access something or a client.\n",
      "There are important papers among these things, there are a number of unimportant papers among these things.\n",
      "And I’m also experiencing some distress about what to do with things that although I don’t intend to use them and haven’t for the past ten years, I have some emotional distress about the idea of disposing of them.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:03): Okay.\n",
      "So, would you say that most of the things that you tend to hoard are papers?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "In this space, almost entirely papers.\n",
      "At home, it would include tools, working and broken; Participants, working and broken; guitars, working and broken.\n",
      "Um…\n",
      "Interviewer (7:30): Okay.\n",
      "And, can you remember how long this behavior has been going on?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably, um… probably the better part of my life.\n",
      "It’s been more apparent in the past thirty years that I’ve been enjoying s stable living space.\n",
      "I find that if you need to move frequently it’s hard to hoard because you have to figure out what can fit in the truck.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:05): Right.\n",
      "So, before these last thirty years were you moving frequently?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I moved often enough that I didn’t accumulate a distressing amount of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:16): Okay.\n",
      "So, it was only after you kind of settled down that you started accumulating more things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:24): Okay.\n",
      "And in your opinion, how severe would you say that your behavior is right now?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, well I work with people in addiction services as well, and one of the amusing terms people use frequently is, “I’m not that bad.”\n",
      "So, I’ll fill that trope and say I’m not that bad, but bad enough that I’m willing to going through the discomfort of talking about it out loud and explaining it to another person.\n",
      "I’m not that uncomfortable.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:03): Okay.\n",
      "So, you do believe it is a problem then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:08): Okay.\n",
      "And, is there any particular reason why you think it’s a problem?\n",
      "What part of your life does it affect that makes you think it’s a problem?\n",
      "So I'm going to read you, so there's a paper that I think NAME has published that deals with the concept of insight and breaks it down into different constructs.\n",
      "And I’d just like to, you to think through these constructs in your clinical experience with your patients.\n",
      "Just to see if you feel like each of these is pertinent for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "If some are more important than others.\n",
      "And again, the purpose of this discussion of insight is to try to better understand this major problem with how to get people into treatment.\n",
      "So the constructs are defensiveness, so I'm being defensive of, of one's possessions, not wanting to give them up.\n",
      "Anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive an illness or that something is wrong, or causing you distress and reducing quality of life, overvalued ideation, which is like when patients really believed that they, that the potential value of the item is above what it is, can range from like mild to more of a delusional kind of problem.\n",
      "And then indifference, which is where patients simply don't care that they have a problem.\n",
      "In your experience with people with hoarding disorder, do they, how do these different constructs breakdown in your patients?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think the anosognosia kind of thing is certainly a presentation that is not unusual, again, more often folks that are brought to treatment [INAUDIBLE 30:25) seek it themselves.\n",
      "I think overvalued ideation is certainly present in a lot of folks in terms of their valuing of items or their seeing the importance of keeping things, or having everything they need, or whatever, for all possible circumstances.\n",
      "Let’s see, possessiveness, I have a problem with that conceptually, I think, what we typically label as possessiveness is almost a psychodynamic concept or behaviorist in my orientation.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you explain what you mean.\n",
      "Interviewee: Excuse me?\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you explain, can you just expand on that a little bit more.\n",
      "I don’t, I’m not…\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, well, when we talk about people being defensive, I think it’s really conceptualized as, ordinarily at least, and, conceptualized as somehow you’re approaching something that is unconscious sleep, triggering their distress or whatever, and that’s a conceptualization model that I don’t think makes much sense.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "I think people act in what we call a defensive way when they see themselves as, or when they experience anxiety because of whatever it is that you’re doing or touching or saying.\n",
      "Interviewer: So defensiveness is more of a behavior or reaction rather than a construct.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I can do it because sometimes I want to tell her to go to hell.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:55): Right, right.\n",
      "So, in that case, I'm gonna move on a little bit down our sections.\n",
      "So, we talked a little bit about your space in your living area, and you told me that there's definitely parts of your home that you can use the way they're supposed to be used.\n",
      "But, now we're going to talk a little bit about your possessions in particular.\n",
      "So, for you, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "So, I know you said you really like to keep things that are pretty or, you know, look appealing to you, but what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, part of what makes them valuable is because some of the stuff, it’ real unique.\n",
      "But it’s unique to me; it wouldn’t be unique to my sister, or my aunt, or anyone else.\n",
      "Just, uh, I used to do Civil War reenacting, okay?\n",
      "Interviewer (30:34): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, I had a huge tan.\n",
      "I had clothing, I had jewelry— everything.\n",
      "And every time I look at jewelry, I'm always thinking about things that would be from the Civil War period.\n",
      "Even though I can't do it anymore.\n",
      "But, you know, I still look for things that would be for that.\n",
      "And then you’ve gotta have somewhere to put it.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:02): Right.\n",
      "So, for you, it's about, you know, things being unique, but not necessarily like having financial value, for example.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Most of the stuff I got does not have financial value, it just has beauty value to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:20): Okay.\n",
      "So, I could, I could assume then that it might be difficult for somebody else to understand the things that you keep and why you can keep them if they’re special to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:32): Okay.\n",
      "So, what is considered trash to you?\n",
      "So, what, what is really easy for you to discard?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, when I get around to going through my mail.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:45): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Just throw away the envelopes, the outside envelope, the inside envelope.\n",
      "I'm just pulling off the part that I can pay a bill.\n",
      "Seeing a bag of trash fill up is very exciting to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:01): Right.\n",
      "So, you enjoy throwing things away, like when you get down to it, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I do, I do.\n",
      "I feel good about it, it's, it's just, uh, there’s not enough that I want to get rid of that would impact a lot of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:23): And, I know you said earlier that—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "See when my sister moved in, it was very traumatic for me and most of my furniture in my condo.\n",
      "Because she brought her stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:33): Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, and I mean, so this is a question that we ask clinicians during this interview every time, and I guess the kind of sticking point or the rub, the followup is that distress criteria.\n",
      "So, if hoarders have low insight and they're not necessarily distressed by their own behavior, is somebody who's not experiencing what they would call distress, who prefers to keep their possessions rather than say, you know, have a social life, are they going to get the diagnosis of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I mean, it doesn't necessarily, in my conceptualization of it the way I always try to make diagnosis is distress doesn't narrowly have to be experienced by the individual in the primary sense.\n",
      "Could be secondary distress, that there's arguments about the primary hoarding problem, but the distress could come at the absence of socializing or impaired social functioning, that's still social impairment, even if it's not distress.\n",
      "Someone who has schizoid personality disorder and no interpersonal relationships, they may not be bothered by not having personal relationships, but you would still say that their socializing is impaired.\n",
      "Someone who's a psychopathic deviate is perhaps not distressed by it causing harm to other people, but they're stressing others.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, when in the DSM-V criteria it says, \"This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discarding them, that criteria you applied meaning specifically they experience distress if they discard.\n",
      "They might not be distressed about the presence of the items, but hypothetically discarding causes them distress?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, no, I mean many people are not distressed at all by the presence of the items, it would be just if they parted with the items or they maybe stressed by the arguments or the embarrassment that comes as a secondary result of the presence of the items.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, I want to return to the idea of the space, and I'm wondering, is it just the amount of items that is what you're kind of looking for in addition to distress, or is it also an organizational issue?\n",
      "So, if somebody had their house completely full of items but they were all very orderly and they knew exactly where they were, would that still meet criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, yeah so I think it matters completely about how it's organized and you can't go based on the total number of items, but it's whether the space is still functional and whether there's any hazard.\n",
      "If it is so many items that it's a fire hazard, even if it's organized, then you could still make the diagnosis I think.\n",
      "But someone who just has narrow little passageways to get through very well organized stacks of paper, but the stacks of paper are likely to collapse onto the person or cause a fire hazard, I would still give the diagnosis.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "After a fashion, actually, it’s interesting that you’re asking that question actually.\n",
      "Our daughter, who is staying with us because of the COVID right after college, went about clearing up a couple of drawers within the last month.\n",
      "I was surprised to see how many broken and unused kitchen tools were in those drawers.\n",
      "And after she organized that, we got rid of quite a bit of stuff.\n",
      "She recently did the same thing in the spice cabinet near the stove as well.\n",
      "And I think both my wife and I didn’t experience discomfort at that, but it was a pleasure to see somebody who didn’t have a disorganized mind, and [inaudible; (23:37)] a part of the kitchen.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:40): Right.\n",
      "So, she was mostly getting rid of kitchen appliances, and old spices, and things like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:48): Okay, so, is it easier for you, in your opinion, to get rid of things kind of when there’s someone else spearheading the effort or is it easier when you’re in charge of what’s to get rid of.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think being accompanied by someone who is not emotionally attached to the stuff can say, “here’s six corkscrews, pick the one’s you want to keep.”\n",
      "Interviewer (24:16): Right, okay.\n",
      "So, now we’re going to talk a little bit about the value of the things you keep.\n",
      "So, when you think about your possessions, what do you think makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "What do I think makes them valuable?\n",
      "Um, most of the things that are retained, I have some associated event or memory with them.\n",
      "Like in the office, I’ve got legal books from my father that I haven’t opened in 20 or 25 years here, but I can’t imagine anyone else having any use for them and I’m uncomfortable with the idea of putting them in the recycling bin.\n",
      "So, [inaudible] his old law dictionary and reference manuals from his practice and arguably my practice, but stuff that I’m actually using digital resources instead of the item because of physical [inaudible] of some kind that I would rather give to a relative to have instead of the recycling bin.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:55): Right, so something being sentimental is important whether you decide to keep anything or not?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It is, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:03): Okay, and I actually want to ask a little bit about your office space too.\n",
      "I forgot earlier to ask, but what does your office space look like?\n",
      "I know you said earlier that there was like filing cabinets and paper, but can you go into a little bit more detail?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Since I’m in semi-retirement now it’s in some ways kind of a museum of hits and misses.\n",
      "Triumphant outcomes and catastrophes.\n",
      "Records of some kinds of events being used as templates for ongoing efforts and other things that are 20-years not referred to and an outsider would have a hard time understanding why.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Well, I really appreciate your time.\n",
      "We're just about at the end of the interview, I just want to close by asking you if you feel like there's anything important that we didn't touch on.\n",
      "And just to follow that by saying what you think the most important things that we still don't know about hoarding disorder that you would like to know.\n",
      "I know that that's a very big question because there were a lot of fun moments.\n",
      "But if you were to answer one question, what question…\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "I, off the top, I can think of something that we haven’t talked about that’s really important.\n",
      "I do think what we don’t know enough about is how to get people engaged in treatment.\n",
      "I think there’s good reason to think there are an awful lot of hoarders out there that nobody ever treats.\n",
      "And the percentage of them are a substantial percentage of are [INAUDIBLE 41:28) are unlikely to seek treatment or, I don’t know, even think that they themselves have much of a problem.\n",
      "And I don’t think we know anywhere near enough about how to help them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yup, yup.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well that's hopefully what we're going to try to get at with this project and we were really, as you know, I’m going to stop the recording.\n",
      "Thank you so much for your time again.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That, you know, that everything would be organized.\n",
      "Um, that— and I'm trying.\n",
      "I honestly, I’ve tried, and I've tried, and tried.\n",
      "And I'll spend the whole weekend and I’ll clean out a closet, and a year later that closet doesn't look like it's ever been touched.\n",
      "I have a craft room.\n",
      "I had, you know, I throw everything in big totes.\n",
      "And then, one by one, I started emptying the totes so that I can organize the room.\n",
      "And I still— it's more organized than it was before, but I'm still having trouble making the space cleaned up.\n",
      "And I just have a tendency to have too much stuff.\n",
      "I don't need this stuff, but at the same time, it's not things that I'm willing to just throw away.\n",
      "That's, that's just a different problem.\n",
      "You know, and I, I clean up, and I put all the stuff, you know, I throw away big bags of trash, and I put together big boxes for the Goodwill.\n",
      "But there just always seems to be more.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:25): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And, part of the problem that I have with, with cleaning up the clutter, is that when you start to do that, it’s always worse before it gets better.\n",
      "So, for example, if I want to clean out a closet, the only way to do that is to pull everything out of the closet.\n",
      "And then start, you know, going through it, and putting it in the piles, and what to keep and what to throw out and what to give away.\n",
      "And then start to put it back in the closet.\n",
      "And, you know, a matter of time and space to do that is really difficult.\n",
      "I mean, to be able to do that even in my own bedroom, means that I may not be able to sleep on the bed by the time I pull all the stuff out.\n",
      "It's going to take me more than a day.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:22): Right.\n",
      "Does it usually take you more than a day, or like that same amount of time every time you've tried to clean up a certain area?\n",
      "Interviewer: When you see patients in your research, how much insight do they tend to have when you first see them?\n",
      "Interviewee: I actually think, like the people I see, are not in the clinic, they’re coming for research, and they responded to an ad for pack rats or hoarders.\n",
      "So they know they self-identify as being one of those people.\n",
      "But I would say they, we intentionally use the word pack rat because we don’t want it to have like a value judgment, like you have a problem per se, more like there’s this quirky thing about you.\n",
      "I think they’ll agree to that.\n",
      "So they all know like, oh I have a lot of stuff and people think I'm weird and people think I have too much stuff and all that stuff, really good stuff.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "I think they're aware of it to that extent.\n",
      "I don't think they're particularly aware of like any mental health concerns that might be feeding into their drive toward the goods.\n",
      "They just take it at face value that they like this stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like they may have pretty low insight, for the most part.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: So in the literature, there's this, there's this paper published by NAME (25:47) about the concept of insight, which broke the concept down into different constructs.\n",
      "So I'm going to read you the list of the constructs that he came up with and I'd like you to just talk through whether any of them seem more or less important in your experience.\n",
      "The first one is defensiveness.\n",
      "The second one is anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive an illness where that's something is wrong with your life.\n",
      "The third one is overvalued ideation.\n",
      "So believing in that the potential value of items is more than it is and it can be my mild or it can be delusional.\n",
      "And then the final one is indifference.\n",
      "So with your patients that you see in research, what, which if any of these concepts, or these constructs that go into insight is most important?\n",
      "Interviewee: I’d say that I would agree with the existence of all of them.\n",
      "Can you just say the labels quickly one more time and I’ll pick a winner?\n",
      "Interviewee: So defensiveness.\n",
      "Interviewee: Defensiveness.\n",
      "Interviewer: Anosognosia, so not being able to perceive your illness at all or that anything is wrong.\n",
      "Overvalued ideation, which is a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items that can range from mild to delusional, or else indifference or you just don't, don't really care, if there is a problem.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that over-valuing is the winner, and defensiveness is a problem.\n",
      "You can’t address the overvaluation because of the defensiveness.\n",
      "Interviewer: So they’re related in that way.\n",
      "So it sounds like for your patients with low insight, it is almost like a delusion when they look at their things, they see something different than what other people would see.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: So they look at the same pile of items and they, they see, you know, that it would be, they would estimate that it will be worth a thousand dollars, whereas, you know, you would estimate that it'd be worth nothing or smaller amount of money.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Speaker: … uh … so, um, in children’s or in general?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: You can do in general and then for children.\n",
      "Speaker: Uh … well, uh, I could only answer the part that I was, um ..., concerned about my son\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay\n",
      "Speaker: So I’m not sure if I’ll be able to give the general, you know, explanation\n",
      "Interviewer 1: No, that’s fine\n",
      "Speaker: So in my son’s case, it was like that, um, something was holding him to actually flourish and be able to ,uh … um , express his feelings, his thoughts, be able to defend himself.\n",
      "So I wasn’t sure if it’s um self-confidence, is it uh ADD because my daughter has ADHD.\n",
      "So in he had shown some anxiety, um, so that’s why we thought okay, we need to have him to be tested.\n",
      "So, and then people tested and they said he has anxiety.\n",
      "So we have gotten maybe, 2 or 4 sessions so it hasn’t been a long time so it’s been mostly to know, uh, put it on to know what he’s going through.\n",
      "It hasn’t gotten a lot of, uh um … therapy.\n",
      "Interview 1: Right.\n",
      "Speaker: To help him.\n",
      "So, I know um, how much of the therapy he has gotten, it’s been really helping him move forward because one of the things that, um, has changed since he started the therapy is that my daughter moved out.\n",
      "So, that component, I think that helped to not to be stressed out.\n",
      "So, um, he doesn’t actually do a couple of uh that the doctor asked him to do to help him with anxiety.\n",
      "He says “no I don’t feel any anxiety” so I’m not sure that um … at this point, um, what he has gotten through the therapy has helped him\n",
      "Interviewer 1: But you think the therapy will help him express him and make him bounded?\n",
      "Speaker: Bounded to himself, yeah, and if he, if there are things that keep him, that hold him back, so he will be able to find a way to fight it instead of just ignoring it.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay.\n",
      "Um, could you tell me what you know about CBT or how you would explain what CBT is?\n",
      "Speaker: Unfortunately, I won’t be able to answer that.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Um, so when you first learned about the kind of therapy we do here, do you remember what kind of questions you had or what you would want to know about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: It never came up, actually, in the conversation, the cognitive behavioral therapy.\n",
      "So as I said, we had some concern about his memory, about his forgetting stuff, being able.\n",
      "So thinking that it was ADD, it actually to calm and have him tested.\n",
      "So uh, it never crossed my mind that okay, this is something that I need to go uh study because it never uh … um, portrayed as cognitive difficulty.\n",
      "So I said okay, he has anxiety, so that’s why it’s a little bit difficult for me to talk about it in a [\n",
      "]\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Um, So did you know anything about CBT from like the movies or the TV or anything?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: No?\n",
      "Um, and then are there any parts of the therapy so far that are confusing to you?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: No?\n",
      "Um, what would you want to tell someone who is about to start CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: So um, I want to just make it clear.\n",
      "So he’s getting the therapy for his anxiety.\n",
      "So is this considered to be CBT?\n",
      "Because maybe, as we had our session, the student came and talk about it and I thought it was about anxiety.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So, this like basically the CBT is to help him fight the anxiety.\n",
      "Likes it’s the type of therapy that helps him combat the anxiety.\n",
      "Interview 017\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay great.\n",
      "So those are all the listing prompts that we have for you and I appreciate you going through that exercise, and again, as I explained the idea behind that is to generate these lists and to kind of be able to compare both within clinician groups, different kinds of clinicians, and to compare clinicians to patients to be able to say which ideas are most salient for different groups.\n",
      "So now we’re just going to get into a kind of semi-structure qualitative interview, and to start that off I’d just like you to give me a really brief idea of your professional background related to hoarding disorder, how you are involved with either research or treating patients with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, so I went to undergrad at [NAME 6:39] University where I majored in psychology and worked with several of the labs on campus doing research as an undergrad and became involved in a lab that studied anxiety and related disorders kind of more broadly, and so I ended up staying post my bachelor’s degree and getting a research assistant position there and a grant where I worked on anxiety treatment trials.\n",
      "During that time, I became interested in anxiety as well as some of the related conditions like OCD and hoarding, and so I ended up applying to graduate school and staying at [NAME 7:19] and working there with [NAME 7:23] who had a former student’s lab here at [NAME 7:24] clinic who also did hoarding research so I just started working with her and it became kind of an interest of mine.\n",
      "And so it was just something that clinically was fascinating to me, obviously from a research perspective was fascinating to me, and so I started developing my master’s thesis around this idea of hoarding and how maybe things in the environment like clutter might exacerbate hoarding symptoms.\n",
      "And then sent those to my [INAUDUBLE 7:52] graduate school kind of studying both hoarding and OCD, publishing a fair amount in this area and then since then am living in New Orleans working here at [NAME 8:04] as a researcher and don’t focus as much anymore on hoarding.\n",
      "This is not the primary premises of what we do at the [NAME 8:12] we see a lot more of PTSD and maybe other anxiety patients and a lot of primary depression and substance abuse, but it’s still something I kind of dabbled in.\n",
      "Also, I’ve treated a handful of patients working in graduate school in [NAME 8:25] clinic.\n",
      "We have an anxiety and behavioral health clinic, which was an outpatient clinic that services individuals on the university’s [INAUDIBLE 8:31] community and so I carried the case load of about two hoarders at the time throughout my time in graduate school working there as well so all the cases of clinical experience were kind of understanding and treating the symptoms.\n",
      "Interviewer: And in your current position do you see hoarding patients clinically?\n",
      "I know you said that it’s not your primary focus.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I do not.\n",
      "I don’t see patients at all now unless it’s a part of a treatment trial.\n",
      "I’ve decided to primarily fund myself through grants and I do have some work and some things I’m collecting right now with regards to OCD but nothing right now with regard to hoarding.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, it makes him crazy.\n",
      "He was brought up in a household where, you know, his mother was at home, and she had a cleaning schedule, and everything had its place, and it was always cleaned up.\n",
      "You know, alternately, I grew up in a household where both my parents worked, and even as a child I was expected to do things like cook dinner and do the grocery shopping and whatever, by the time I was 12 or 13 years old.\n",
      "And so, there wasn't ever really a lot of time to do that sort of, very orderly cleaning and, and I've always worked, and I know that my husband tries to keep his areas in the house neat and organized.\n",
      "And it makes him, it makes him just nutty that I can't.\n",
      "And, you know, for that reason, I don't like to have people come to my house.\n",
      "But he doesn't want people to come to the house either.\n",
      "I need some work done in the house.\n",
      "And in order to get work men to come in, you know, his first response is, there is nobody coming in here until we get this mess cleaned up.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:46): So, does he try to help you clean things up when you guys are having someone over?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. Because 90% of the issue, at least the issue that he believes, is that it’s me, and it's my stuff.\n",
      "And given the opportunity, he would just take a green plastic trash bag and then just start like, throwing things away.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:09): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Just throwing it away, without ever any thought of it.\n",
      "And, I just have, I have a really hard time doing that.\n",
      "I mean, I have things like, you know, letters that were sent to me when I was in high school.\n",
      "And now I’ve been out of high school like 45 years.\n",
      "But I don't want to give those things up.\n",
      "But I should, I don't ever look at them.\n",
      "They're just there.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:34): So, has that ever happened?\n",
      "That scenario where he just started throwing things away.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, he has thrown things away, and then when I go on to get whatever it was— in fact, the one thing I can remember was I had, when my kids were young, I had a big bag of cookie cutters.\n",
      "A big bag.\n",
      "And, of course, I didn't bake cookies on a regular basis, but of course, you would do it at Christmas time or whatever.\n",
      "And, one year I went to get those cookie cutters, and I could not find them anywhere.\n",
      "And I said something about it, and he says, “Oh, I threw those away ages ago.\n",
      "You never use them.”\n",
      "Makes me crazy.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:17): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Makes me crazy, because what he throws away or gives things away like that, my first response is well, I just need to go out and buy more.\n",
      "Interviewer: And just kind of as a closing out question, for you what do you think is the biggest unanswered questions about this disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think there’s several.\n",
      "I think number one, we don’t know the pathophysiology and unfortunately that’s true for most of our psychiatric disorders.\n",
      "It is so under researched, there’s only a handful.\n",
      "I mean you’re working with (NAME, 1:07:30) and she’s one of the handful of people that are actually looking into this and trying to identify what are the brain abnormalities, is there a particular pattern.\n",
      "Which then leads into the second question which is, what are the best treatments for it?\n",
      "Because the current treatments we have are kind of plus-minus, they’re not all that great.\n",
      "Our group has done some of the medication studies and they’re kind of okay, but so far there hasn’t been a controlled trial.\n",
      "My concern is that even the good results we got in our open trials they might not pan out in controlled studies.\n",
      "Because everybody who treats this certainly sees a lot of people who are non-responders to the same medications and the behavioral therapy, while it’s good, the response rates and the degree of response is not all that great and I think we could do a lot better.\n",
      "Some of the new things like adding in cognitive remediation that (NAME, 1:08:30) has worked at looks like its good and it’s helped and it’s improved response rates.\n",
      "I think we still have a long ways to go in learning about what treatments are going to work best, whether it’s medication, behavioral therapies, or other.\n",
      "We don’t know nearly enough about what are the underlying substrates of it and what’s the pattern of pathophysiology.\n",
      "I think those are the two big things.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well, I really appreciate your time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so I’m going to be doing a little bit of mirroring in this interview, so as I do that please correct me if I say something back to you that doesn’t sound right.\n",
      "So it sounds like there’s two main categories of distinction between hoarding disorder and collecting behavior.\n",
      "The first one being about the reasons and also it sounds perhaps like there are distinctions in terms of what exactly is saved.\n",
      "So, a collection is not saved because of some future use for it and also it sounds like a collection is saved like it’s a discrete set or type of item whereas someone with hoarding disorder will not save something that is a– I guess that’s a question.\n",
      "Could you have hoarding disorder and have a home full of bottle caps exclusively or bottle caps and coo-coo clocks and I don’t know what other things people collect, clown dolls I guess.\n",
      "Can you hoard in that way or is that a distinguishing feature?\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean I think sometimes there are.\n",
      "I’ve encountered people with hoarding disorder who have, as part of stuff they’ve saved, some collectibles.\n",
      "And maybe they’ve had excess acquisition of particular kinds of collectibles.\n",
      "It’s just that it usually goes far, far beyond that.\n",
      "So, it’s not that it can’t include collectibles it’s just that it almost always includes way more than that.\n",
      "So you see lots of different objects and types of things saved and the types of things saved are usually most of the time the same sorts of things that everybody saves just to a much greater degree.\n",
      "So, papers, magazines, storage supplies, old clothes that don’t fit anymore, and all kinds of other things, whereas again collections are more discreetly focused on particular areas of interest.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so it sounds like it’s not about the type of item or even that there is a type so much as that access of different types that they might have collectibles and might have a collection in the midst of many, many other things.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah and the motivation.\n",
      "Are you saving it because of anxiety and emotional distress because you feel like, “Oh I might need it someday, don’t touch it” or is it because of desire to have this particular type of collection that you can display and be proud of.\n",
      "There’s a big difference of the emotional reaction and approach to and what happens with discarding and a big difference with the motivations.\n",
      "Interviewer: It sounds like from what you said there’s also a big difference in how the collection is organized versus how someone with hoarding disorder has their items.\n",
      "Do you feel like that’s a distinguishing factor?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, because usually disorganization tends to be a prominent part of the problem in most patients with hoarding disorder and you don’t necessarily see that with people who are just collecting something.\n",
      "Interviewer: The last question I want to ask is also a hard question to answer and I just kind of want to hear you think through it.\n",
      "Do you think that hoarding disorder and the things that kind of play into people’s acquisition and keeping things, do you think that there is an aspect to which cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions and ownership, do you think that there’s any association between those two kinds of ideas in hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it would be hard for there not to be.\n",
      "Yeah, I think there definitely is.\n",
      "I mean I know hoarding can exist in the absence of these things and it’s something that’s been around for a really long time and doesn’t necessarily, I know that the early conceptualizations or theories about hoarding and its arising from not having a lot or being less fortunate has never [INAUDIBLE 45:23] in the literature but I can’t help but think that the culture and the ay that they live now and this idea of being able to readily consume things doesn’t feed into that or doesn’t exacerbate a problem that we have.\n",
      "You know just think about attention deficit in children and how they’re like, there are a probably more things drawing their attention now than there would’ve been decades ago and how that maybe has influenced the course or the nature of the disorder and how we see it.\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess kind of along those lines, have you seen instances in which either hoarding disorder—these days there’s a lot of talk about associating memories with items through souvenirs or through photographs.\n",
      "I guess it’s not really a new thing but culturally there’s a lot of association with needing to save memories as physicals objects as opposed to just saving memories.\n",
      "Do you think that that could have anything to do with the development of hoarding disorder, just because it seems like many hoarders talk about their possessions in terms of memory and forgetting?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and what’s the question?\n",
      "I’m sorry, I get where you’re going but what was the actual question?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, no, I guess I just wanted to talk about that or to see if you had any thoughts on that issue of if you had encountered that?\n",
      "Interviewee: I definitely have, I mean thinking about Mardi Gras like I said earlier, almost like every memory she had of Mardi Gras would be erased if she got rid of all the cups or maybe all the cups but one.\n",
      "She was very fearful that she would forget about that time, which I just found interesting.\n",
      "Interviewer: And it’s interesting because it doesn’t sound like the cups were necessarily a reminder that the event existed, but more something in between, you know what I mean, more of like a physical acknowledgement.\n",
      "Interviewee: Representation of that, yes.\n",
      "Yeah, I also remember her not being able to get rid of any wrapping paper that had been given to her, like as a gift from a friend, she had saved every bit of wrapping paper, any gift that was given to her she had saved the wrapping paper that went around the gift even if the wrapping paper had been torn off and couldn’t be used again it because it was a reminder of that friend and the gift and almost like she wouldn’t remember the friend, or it would be a spite to the friend if she got rid of it, which was very interesting to me.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so the first thing I’d like to talk through with you is the diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So just to start the discussion I’d like you to give me an overview of what you think the most important differences, the most salient differences, between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps collecting, and hoarding disorder are.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, okay, so and then there’s some literature and (INAUDIBLE, 15:41) and colleagues on that and the differential.\n",
      "So, differences between collecting behavior and hoarding disorder would be that collecting behavior is usually focused just on items being collected and so it’s narrow and specific.\n",
      "It does not include saving or voiding discarding things because you think that they might be needed in the future or that you could give them to someone that they might be useful someday or that something bad would happen if you no longer had that item.\n",
      "With collecting, it’s pretty clear that people have a clear-cut reason for saving those particular items and its because they are part of their collection, they like that particular set of items.\n",
      "They’re not thinking that they’re saving stuff because they might need it for taxes someday or because that they might need it around the house or if its broken they might be able to fix it and then use it for a craft project or something like that.\n",
      "So the reasons for saving are going to be different.\n",
      "Number two, collections usually do not produce the same level of clutter.\n",
      "People store their collections, they display their collections, they’re often proud of their collections, whereas a person with hoarding disorder often is quite ashamed and doesn’t want anybody to see what’s piled up in their home.\n",
      "So, it frequently at least with the patients who have insight it’s the clutter and then the fact that they save so many things is actually causing distress whereas collections clearly don’t cause distress for that person.\n",
      "Sometimes someone else living in the home may feel like the collection is taking up too much space so that may be a similarity, but rarely it gets to the point of hoarding.\n",
      "I think those are probably the main differences.\n",
      "The practice of it ends up being pretty easy to distinguish between the two.\n",
      "054\n",
      "Interviewer (0:00): Okay. So, for the first part of the interview I’m gonna just ask you, um, preemptively, what term do you prefer when we’re talking about hoarding or clutter problems?\n",
      "Is there a specific term you’d like to use?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, they’re all the same to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (0:18): Okay, so is hoarding disorder okay, or hoarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Mhmm.\n",
      "Interviewer (4:38): Okay.\n",
      "So, that concludes the first little part of the interview now.\n",
      "The next part is going to be more like a conversation.\n",
      "So, I'm going to ask you about a bunch of things related to your experience and your life reporting.\n",
      "So, to start off, I want you to describe for me kind of your clutter problems, or your hoarding.\n",
      "So, like, how long has this been going on?\n",
      "And do you remember kind of how it started?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um.. when it started?\n",
      "Um… darn, I’ve always had the problem.\n",
      "Interviewer (5:10): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know, I’ve always had it.\n",
      "When I, I— the company I worked for, how bad it was at work, is I kept things that were twenty, thirty years old.\n",
      "Interviewer (5:20): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because I always thought I had a need for it.\n",
      "Interviewer (5:26): So, you would say it’s kind of been ongoing throughout your life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (5:33): There wasn't like a particular point where it began?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… no. Well, um, when I got, um, my first husband.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "It, it started there.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how did it start?\n",
      "What kind of behaviors were you, you know, seeing in yourself when it began?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, just thinking I needed everything.\n",
      "I find it useful at some time or another.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:04): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:06): Okay.\n",
      "And, so, how does your behavior at, you know, the beginning of when this all started kind of compare to how it is now?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I'm stressed all the time.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:21): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m stressed.\n",
      "And, I have a bad habit of picking up something, picking up an item, and I end up putting it in another spot and I put it back.\n",
      "It's just, it's ridiculous.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:33): Right.\n",
      "So, would you consider your behavior to be relatively severe, or would you say it's more moderate?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m gonna say severe because I have a hard time giving things up.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:46): Mhmm.\n",
      "So you definitely consider it a problem in your own life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh gosh, it's a major problem.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:53): Okay, so, can you kind of emphasize on that a little bit for me?\n",
      "So, what in particular makes you think that it's a problem in your life?\n",
      "Interviewer: So excessive in the sense of above the norm or different from normal, and also causing problems in your life.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think most people could recognize that they own more possessions than other people, so they would be insightful in that sense; but, where they might not be insightful is recognizing that this is a problematic number of possessions to have given the space you're living in.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, there was this paper about insight that was a publication of Randy Frost where he broke the concept of insight into four different constructs for hoarding disorder specifically.\n",
      "And the constructs are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive an illness, overvalued ideation, believing that items are more valuable than they are, and indifference.\n",
      "And I wonder if you feel like those resonate with your experience of insight and hoarding?\n",
      "Or if there are some that are more important in your mind than others in patients who have lower insight?\n",
      "I would read them again.\n",
      "Interviewee: What was the first one?\n",
      "Interviewer: Defensiveness, is the first one so being defensive about their items and wanting to make sure that people don't take them.\n",
      "Anosognosia, or not being able to perceive that's an illness at all or that anything is wrong or causing them distress.\n",
      "Overvalued ideation, which is when they believe that their objects are more valuable than they are, and that their behavior is rational because their objects are valuable.\n",
      "And being indifferent to the state of their home and the state of their space.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think probably in terms of which is more important, I think the first and the last.\n",
      "From what I've seen, there's not necessarily as much overvalued ideation in the sense that people really, like people will say, \"I know I could live without this, but it's more that I just don't want to,\" which I think is probably a combination of...well the defensiveness is probably wanting to be in control and not wanting to be told what to do, and the indifference is kind of like, \"Yeah the hoarding is bad, the stuff is there and it's sort of a problem and it's sort of not, or it doesn't bother me that much,\" kind of indifferent to it.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, there, there was a kid's, um [inaudible; (19:22)].\n",
      "I’m sorry, one second.\n",
      "Interviewer (19:23): No worries.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah um, there was a kid’s toy kitchen set.\n",
      "It was in the laundry room, and it was in the way, and when my sister moved in she brought a bunch of her crap down.\n",
      "So, when you try to fit two women in, uh, like 100 square feet, with all the stuff, it just, you know… But it was, it was so bad before the storage room, it was not safe for me to go in there.\n",
      "Interviewer (19:49): Gotcha.\n",
      "So, when you say unsafe, do you mean like there was things—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I could have tripped over it.\n",
      "Interviewer (19:56): —things that could’ve fallen down or tripped over?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, tripped over things in there because there was a lot of stuff in there.\n",
      "There was, there was paint.\n",
      "Painting have been that prior, different things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:06): Okay, so, in the spaces that you do hoard things, is there any sort of like, organization to how you put things, or did you have a certain method for how you might stack things or place things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, well, for example, I’m trying to go through some costume jewelry.\n",
      "I’ve got crews of costume jewelry.\n",
      "And, I have this big imagination of ways I can display this up because I would want to have a yard sale when all this craziness is over.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:32): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, but just giving it out.\n",
      "I’ve got this big, big container, and I’m just trying to go through it.\n",
      "It's just, it's a challenge.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:43): Yeah, for sure.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:46): So, in your childhood, in your past, I know you said that your sister now living with you has definitely taken issue with some of these behaviors and your second husband, but, um, when you were growing up at all, your parents never really had an issue with you keeping stuff?\n",
      "Or maybe your friends now, did they ever have issues with you keeping stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, my one that just passed would not have any, because she was a major hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:15): Really?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Hers was om medications, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:21): Oh, so she would hoard medications?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "And um, as a kid the only thing that I can recall that was very irritating is my older sister, which just now passed.\n",
      "She used to wear my clothes and, and, you know, that was okay.\n",
      "But, when she would get home, she would lounge there all day long, she’d smoke in my clothes and everything was horrible.\n",
      "So, I'm you know, I'm also clothes hoarder.\n",
      "That's part of that, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:49): Okay, so your experiences with your sister and your childhood have, um, contributed to you hoarding clothes?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:58): Okay, so what kind of clothes do you hoard, and how do you keep them?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, that is very interesting.\n",
      "So, I guess the last piece of criteria that we’d like to talk through with you is something that you mentioned already and that’s about distress and how you assess this.\n",
      "So, the criterion reads, “difficulty discarding due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discarding them.”\n",
      "And so, how do you determine how much distress is normal or abnormal?\n",
      "And is it difficult to sometimes determine the level of distress when people have very low insight and deny having a problem?\n",
      "So perhaps say, “Oh, yeah, I could throw away this item anytime I wanted and it wouldn’t upset me and it would be fine, but I just choose not to.”\n",
      "How do you assess distress in that context?\n",
      "Interviewee: That is hard, typically what I do when I was treating patients is we would do a behavioral experiment in the first session where I would actually ask them to bring in a couple of items, and the idea was that I was going to keep the items for a week and then they would be returned back to the patient just to kind of see and to get a gage like you know kind of like an actual behavioral design or experiment to check what their distress level was regarding parting with the item at the moment.\n",
      "But even if you know it’s not going to be thrown away, is it still difficult to not have it and to wonder what I’m going to do with the item?\n",
      "And so that’s kind of one way—I would say most of the time people don’t have a problem, or at least from my own small sample of anecdotal evidence, I don’t have a lot of people telling me that they’re distressed if things get thrown away.\n",
      "But [INAUDIBLE 29:47] have been some occasions where someone felt [INAUDIBLE 19:50] something away, you know?\n",
      "And they got very upset about it, they got very angry, they couldn’t let it go, they’re still thinking about it staying in my office, and so it’s kind of sometimes easy to determine the distress.\n",
      "That patient I mentioned earlier, there was in incident in which it was much harder to determine.\n",
      "He was very—he was like, you know, we tried to asses hoarding and he was like, “I’m not a hoarder.”\n",
      "And then just answered zero on all the items on the hoarding scale, because he claimed he wasn’t distressed, but it was unclear to see.\n",
      "I would actually have to physically do an experiment we would go there and kind of toss away some of these things that are clearly trash and see how he reacts or responds.\n",
      "For the most part, I feel like people are more easily able to tell me that they’re highly distressed by the thought of getting rid of things.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, they are able to self-identify themselves as having distress?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, they are not as able to identify the impairment, I would say, that’s where the insight comes in for me.\n",
      "So, they’re not as able to determine that it’s a problem but they are able to tell me that, “yes it’s very distressing and if I were to get rid of this I would be very upset or sad or angry”.\n",
      "Speaker: Anything that’s like in this area is everyone’s.\n",
      "Pets are the same way, is it’s on their level, and they think that they can have it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Gotcha, no I can relate to that.\n",
      "So the next thing, we’ve already talked about who and why and where and now we get to what, which is what they would talk about.\n",
      "What questions about CBT do our characters need to ask and answer?\n",
      "Speaker: It could kind of be playful… it could be what the roles are, like what do I have to do?\n",
      "They should ask about what’s expected of me or what the expectations are.\n",
      "Again, I’m a teacher so I think that’s usually where everything starts.\n",
      "Kids want to know, “What do I have to do?” “What am I allowed to do?” that kind of thing.\n",
      "They always just want to know the rules first, they’re always looking for the rules.\n",
      "As a parent, I also want to know what my role is.\n",
      "Like I said, it was really great to come into this and be invited in as a parent.\n",
      "Also, a couple times they’ve said, “Do you mind stepping out,” “Absolutely, of course, as long as my kid’s okay with that, I’m okay with that.”\n",
      "Making it flexible.\n",
      "So those are kind of big topics to hit on, just making sure it seems friendlier to the children.\n",
      "If they know what’s expected of them from the get go.\n",
      "Speaker: If it is going to be more child led or patient led, letting them kind of know… I feel like would be helpful.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like clarifying expectations and roles.\n",
      "Should they be… should they find out about the CBT explanation of how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life?\n",
      "Would that be useful?\n",
      "Speaker: I think so.\n",
      "Is CBT used for anything else?\n",
      "Is there other-is it-are most of the people who would be considering CBT, are they people with anxiety?\n",
      "Is it only anxiety, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer: Uhm… So asking those types, finding out if that would be helpful?\n",
      "Speaker: Well if, I wouldn’t talk about anxiety if that specifically-if CBT is used for broader things.\n",
      "But if it is primarily, you know what I mean.\n",
      "Interviewer: Got you.\n",
      "Speaker: I wouldn’t want to…\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So, only if the video was designed for people who were coming in for anxiety would that be useful?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "Should they ask about how it has worked for their kids?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Should they ask about how exposures work?\n",
      "Speaker: I would think yes?\n",
      "I would say leave it all out on the table.\n",
      "Or as much as possible.\n",
      "It’s a lot to cover but, you know, give a quick little example of what and, you know, that might be enough as a quick little example of even if someone-if it was a casual, silly conversation.\n",
      "Whatever, it could be a game show I could think of a million different ways.\n",
      "It’s been the craziest day, guys.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, Right… No you’re okay.\n",
      "Speaker: But it could be a game show where there’s a quiz, you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Asking questions.\n",
      "Interviewer: So now I’m going to go through a little bit of the criteria more specifically.\n",
      "So one of the criteria, as I’m sure you know, reads “persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value” and I wonder if for you that valuation or the inappropriateness of the valuation of objects is a part of the diagnosis.\n",
      "So is it that they are unable to judge an object’s value?\n",
      "Is that a part of this diagnostic criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, no I don’t think so.\n",
      "The reason that that was put in is because the original criteria, the clinical criteria that (NAME, 34:31) developed ten years prior to that was kind of used.\n",
      "Most research studies said that there was persistent difficulty discarding of items that most people would consider worthless and many people with hoarding disorder have clutter that really consists of stuff that they bought that actually has a lot of financial value.\n",
      "So expensive clothes, stuff that they bought online but in excess quantities.\n",
      "So if you applied the old criteria that stuff wouldn’t be considered worthless or of low value, actually it was pretty valuable stuff.\n",
      "So that’s why that little clause was put in, “regardless of actual value,” because sometimes people have homes filled with highly valuable, expensive stuff.\n",
      "That was the reason for that.\n",
      "Interviewer: It sounds like part of what you said also is that people with collections often seek to display their items whereas individuals with hoarding disorder more often perhaps seek to hide the extent of their behavior.\n",
      "Do you feel like that is a product of the kind of excess and the lack of organization or do you feel like that is a separate factor?\n",
      "So, are they ashamed of their items?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think there’s a great deal of shame amongst people with hoarding who do have insight into their condition.\n",
      "So, they’re hiding often because they’re embarrassed and ashamed and secondly because they’re afraid that they might get into trouble.\n",
      "They don’t want city attorney’s office or fire department or police to see it, or landlord to see it, because they’re worried they might get evicted or get fined because those things in fact do happen.\n",
      "Often times they do get evicted and they do get fined and they do get notices when they have to clear out stuff because there’s a health hazard or something.\n",
      "So the impact of the clutter on their lives is completely different than what would happen with somebody collecting stamps or records or artwork.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like that shame or that, maybe shame is too strong, but that kind of reluctance to show people their items is a part of insight.\n",
      "That part of them realizes the behavior is problematic and that’s why they kind of hide it away or is it something else?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think that’s a big part of it.\n",
      "I think those who have insight into the problem usually are quite ashamed of it and most of the time they have never before until probably just recently ever thought of the problem as a psychiatric disorder.\n",
      "Most of the time what they’ve been hearing for decades is that they’re lazy, they’re just not doing what they’re supposed to do, and it’s a moral failing, and people have been ragging on them “Why can’t you just clean up, you’re causing this problem,” without realizing that it in fact has its substrates and abnormal brain functioning and it’s just as much a psychiatric disorder as schizophrenia or OCD.\n",
      "But prior to the DSM-5 it was never formally recognized as a disorder and still most people, if you interview most people out there in the community, they won’t necessarily know that it’s a psychiatric disorder unless they studied it in some way.\n",
      "Even the TV programs don’t necessarily make that point.\n",
      "This is one of the reasons that we stopped working with some of those shows, Hoarders and Buried Alive.\n",
      "We tried to get give them the information so they could spread more public awareness of the fact that it’s a disorder and the need for treatment rather than just sort of having somebody come in and clearing out your stuff, and they didn’t want to do it.\n",
      "The producers were not interested in that and so for that reason there still is a tremendous stigma and a tremendous lack of awareness of what this is really all about.\n",
      "Speaker: Um and at what point where would you being showing it?\n",
      "Interviewer: So Ideally we would like… I mean it would be something that would be shown to patients and families right before they would start treatment to kind of better understand what they are going to be doing.\n",
      "Speaker: So not like a public service announcement type of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um no more so targeting people who are going into CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: Ok so an introduction to CBT.\n",
      "Um how long will it be?\n",
      "Interviewer: Um not sure.\n",
      "Probably not like 20 minutes.\n",
      "Probably something pretty concise, but enough information so people know what to expect.\n",
      "Speaker: So remind me your question.\n",
      "Interviewer: Who would be in the video?\n",
      "Speaker: Oh boy!\n",
      "Um in a world where everyone needs to be included, um you would have to involve some children maybe with different scenarios of how CBT is done.\n",
      "I would break it into… do you do CBT on a little kid?\n",
      "Interviewer: Um yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah I would say yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: Because… so my daughter sometimes plays games with my daughter.\n",
      "My daughter is 13, so I know games can sometimes help a therapist reach a child or you now.\n",
      "In terms of who would be in it, I would include kids of different ages, different races, male and female.\n",
      "I know a lot of the psychologists are female, but it would be good to show you know a man working with probably a boy.\n",
      "I know my daughter doesn’t want to see anyone who is not a female.\n",
      "So um you know that’s her thing.\n",
      "Parents could be in a waiting room, but they could also be talking to the therapist.\n",
      "You don’t want to necessarily show the checking-out procedure of you know paying because that’s not CBT.\n",
      "That’s policy.\n",
      "Got to pay for what you are getting.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok great!\n",
      "What about nonhuman characters, animals, superheroes, do you think any of those would be appealing?\n",
      "Speaker: Well there are... ok so your mascot almost, sort of.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well not necessarily.\n",
      "It could just I mean for the superheroes that would just be another way to represent things.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: But this based on your perspective.\n",
      "It’s what you think.\n",
      "If you don’t think that superheroes, animals, nonhumans should be involved [36:47] ___.\n",
      "Speaker: I know a lot of times they are effective marketing tools.\n",
      "Would I put them in?\n",
      "Probably not, but I’m also not a marketer.\n",
      "So I know in the real world there are emotional support animals that really could make an appearance.\n",
      "For the younger kids, it would probably be useful to have something cartooning, not anime though.\n",
      "That’s a little to strange.\n",
      "Something that is safe appearing, not something creepy or cringy you know.\n",
      "You want a teddy bear.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so really just the people that are really involved in the process like the kids, the parents, the therapist and stuff like that.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah… I don’t know if you would…teachers don’t usually get involved in?\n",
      "Interviewer: Sometimes, it depends.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know if I would include anything outside of nuclear family or grandparents.\n",
      "It would be the people who would give consent.\n",
      "It would the people who have legal authority over the child.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah great.\n",
      "Um so what about where they would talk… what would be a good setting for the video or multiple settings?\n",
      "Speaker: Um I’m a realist so you know to set the standard.\n",
      "Show them a typical room.\n",
      "Different therapists decorate a little differently.\n",
      "If there’s… if certain colors are meant to elicit certain feelings or um responses do that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: I probably would not do one where there’s a two-way mirror involved because that is that would make anybody feel uncomfortable so.\n",
      "It’s like I’m being watched.\n",
      "Interviewer: So really just like the therapist office would be the best setting.\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a very good question.\n",
      "So, the question is, just to make sure I’m understanding, how do I determine?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, the criteria itself reads, “regardless of actual value” and so I guess I’m wondering when you talk to a patient with hoarding disorder, what is your criteria for determining their ability to value items?\n",
      "I mean, inappropriate valuation is…how do you see that in a patient?\n",
      "How do you determine if a patient is appropriately valuing items?\n",
      "Interviewee: I guess sometimes it’s in the number of things that they evaluate as valuable.\n",
      "I think it’s clear that we all value certain things… an example would be, I don’t have a child but I imagine I my mother has saved some of my childhood things, but didn’t save every single thing.\n",
      "You know, it’s part of my childhood so it’s understanding that like there are certain things that you should save because they remind you of this time or this place but everything may not be necessarily needed or saved.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, so this criterion which says, “difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of actual value” maybe more means that some things have more value than others?\n",
      "That’s what you’re looking for as a normal ability to value items?\n",
      "And not so much that they correctly value valuable items and throw away trash, you know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah that somethings have more—yeah that’s a good way to put it.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so the next one that I’d like to talk through with you is, “the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromise?\n",
      "And how do you determine, for example, if a person lives in a trailer vs if the person has the ability to have a very big house with two or three rooms for storage, how does that play into your ability to make a diagnosis of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that’s a really good question, one that I’ve thought about a lot.\n",
      "So, in terms of the number of “how this or that kind of thing”, I mean, to me, if someone can use—I guess for the intended use, my main problem there is “can you perform activity that have to do with living?” I think with geriatric patients, are you able to shower?\n",
      "Brush your teeth?\n",
      "Can you use your toilet?\n",
      "Are you able to have a bed that you can sleep in or a place that you can sleep?\n",
      "Can you heat up or fix yourself a meal in your home?\n",
      "So, I would say basic kinds of everyday needs like shelter, food, hygiene, clothing, that kind of stuff are the things that I’m looking for in terms of “intended use”.\n",
      "So, it’s less important to me if your house is cluttered and dusty if you can do those things.\n",
      "So, you can have a conflict with a spouse, for instance, that your house is extremely cluttered and yucky but if you can kind of use your house for all intended purposes that you would need it for, in terms of like being able to, like I said, sleep, eat, and shower and take care of those kinds of things, to me that certain criteria is not met unless you cannot do those things\n",
      "Interviewer: What about things that are maybe on the line like using a guest room for a guest as opposed to using a guest room for storage?\n",
      "Or even going a step forward and using the surface of a desk to work on as opposed to using the surface of a desk for storage?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I would say that’s when I would consider it kind of like on the line and maybe more subclinical.\n",
      "I would, probably in that instance, take into account other things like their difficulty discarding possessions and how hard that is, and whether or not this behavior is actually just kind of, you know, let’s say [INAUDIBLE 25:50] from being at the clinical kind of level, if that makes sense?\n",
      "I would also kind of take in to maybe their impairment and how much it bothers them into my conceptualization and diagnosis.\n",
      "And once again I think that I always kind of look back and think, “they’re here for treatment, they want treatment, this is the way I’m going to treat it.”\n",
      "So, labeling it right now as hoarding disorder, whether or not they’re to some degree subclinical versus fully clinical won’t change the way in which I approach it diagnostically, it just may be easier to work with in this moment.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about home size?\n",
      "How does that figure into it?\n",
      "Interviewee: Home size?\n",
      "That’s a really great question and when I was in grad school, mu supervisor and I talked about that a lot.\n",
      "To be honest with you, I don’t think it’s hoarding if you can afford to buy a home.\n",
      "Because you may have this difficulty discarding possessions, you may have this excessive acquisition, but in that case, you likely don’t have the active clutter of the living spaces, which is to me what causes—It’s kind of like the combination the impairment that comes from that symptom.\n",
      "Interviewer: so if you can keep acquiring stuff and have it not impair your life, you don’t have a disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: That would be my thought, yeah.\n",
      "I don’t think I’ve ever thought about it as in depth as we are but yeah, I would ever say that—I mean I think about other disorders and I most of the time try to think about things in terms of when to make it a disorder is when it’s impairing.\n",
      "You know, think about even anxiety.\n",
      "If you have a significant amount of anxiety but it’s not impairing you in any way, even though I may worry about things excessively, if it doesn’t interfere with my sleep or if it doesn’t impair my relationships, is it really a disorder?\n",
      "But it’s a very fascinating and interesting question.\n",
      "Interviewer: And you also have intended use.\n",
      "So the question is if I never cook and I use my kitchen for storage, is that intended use of the kitchen?\n",
      "Is the stove always intended for cooking?\n",
      "Or could it be intended for storage?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "I think that’s what the group that was working on this criteria was talking about is that somebody with hoarding might say, “Oh it’s no problem that I have multiple boxes piled up in my bathtub and shower area, that’s what I’m using it for.”\n",
      "But I think most observers would say that’s a problem because you can’t use the bathroom for what it was intended.\n",
      "So it’s just kind of converting all these other areas that are intended for other things into just storage for clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer: Is the presence of physical objects, this is going to sound like a weird question but I’ll tell you why I’m asking, is the presence of physical objects required.\n",
      "So, for example, could one hoard digital media like digital photographs, digital, you know somebody who saved movies or books on hard drives obsessively.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I’ve had patients who actually filled up multiple hard drives you know with gigabytes and terabytes worth of stuff that they have downloaded.\n",
      "So yeah there’s digital hoarding.\n",
      "Now it doesn’t take up much space physically, but it takes up space on the drive.\n",
      "I’ve had people hoarded emails, maybe had ten thousand emails sitting in their inbox because they were afraid they might need them, so they didn’t want to delete them.\n",
      "Same process.\n",
      "So the thinking process is the same, the emotions are the same, just the medium may be different.\n",
      "But yeah I’ve seen many patients with some level of hoarding of electronical, pdf files, whatever.\n",
      "Interviewer: So this is again maybe going to start off sounding like a weird question, but I hope you’ll end up seeing why I’m asking.\n",
      "So for some healthy individuals obviously there’s a degree of variance in the amount of free space they like around them.\n",
      "So some people are very comfortable only if there desk is clear whereas other people kind of like having a cluttered desk, it makes them feel productive and likewise some people prefer to have a space that’s more cluttered because they like to feel more enclosed by their items.\n",
      "I’m wondering if you feel like that sense of being surrounded by items or being enclosed is part of what’s going on in hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so that’s another kind of area of subjectivity because it has to do with how people react to or what their own emotional sense is about openness versus closedness and clutter.\n",
      "I have encountered some patients who do feel more safe when they’re home with their objects.\n",
      "I know that in (NAME, 42:29) books they described actually a lot more of people like that than I have seen who really describe a feeling of needing to be surrounded by their stuff that I can see.\n",
      "They’re finding they’re scared for them to not have that stuff, they don’t feel comfortable without that stuff.\n",
      "I personally have not, while I have read about it, talked with (NAME, 42:52) about it, I haven’t seen that many of my patients or clinical studies that describe that, but a few, a few did.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, my sister's bedroom pretty much is clutter-free.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:47) Okay, and is that her doing?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "She’s OCD.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:50): Right.\n",
      "Okay, so, how about the common areas?\n",
      "Are there any common areas that are clutter-free?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, right now I’ve got some stuff in the dining room which I’ve gotta move.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:00): Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:03): Okay, so, how about like bathrooms, or maybe like the living rooms?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I have a few things in the living room and the dining room.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:14): Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know, because I've been trying to go through things, you know?\n",
      "The only way I've found that I can actually do something when I, when I look at a room the way it is, I get extremely depressed.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:28): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The way I had dealt with some of that is I would pick up an item, which is the only way you could do it, and say, “Where can I put this?\n",
      "Where is somewhere?” And that's how I have to do it because I cannot face the bedroom.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:45): So, for you, it's better to look at things one at a time and kind of deal with them on a piece-by-piece basis.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s the only way I could do it.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:55): Right.\n",
      "So, in that case, you don't get overwhelmed like you said?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:01): Okay, so, um, in terms of, you know, the clutter in, in your house has it prevented you from maybe having people over, or maybe has it ever caused like, an issue with a landlord or someone visiting?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, well, actually, my oldest sister wanted to come to the house, and I told her she couldn't because it's such a mess.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:19): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It was so bad, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer (26:22): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:24): So, when something like that happens, do you typically try and like, clean it up or did you just say, “No, I'm sorry,” or something like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, when I told her, I said, “Hun, it is such a mess for you to come in here.”\n",
      "And she said, “If I don’t come in now I’m not coming ever.”\n",
      "So, it's like her decision.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:48): Right.\n",
      "Okay, so, but nothing like a conflict with like, a landlord or like, a property owner, or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, no. Um, I own my own condo.\n",
      "I do that, and um, no, no. I won't even let the pest control guy come in.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:06): Okay, so is that because maybe you're a bit embarrassed about the clutter or, you—?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So how would you say that it’s been helping him with his feelings?\n",
      "Speaker: Well unfortunately, he’s not kind of kid who would talk a lot and he’s very busy with school and since uh [\n",
      "], he’s in a magnet program in middle school so when he comes home at 5pm and he goes to work, you know, finishing his homework, so there’s not a lot of uh, so it’s, there are not a lot of um scenarios that I could see and say “oh okay, that happened and he didn’t respond the right way or he did uh um uh, he-he-he did the right response”.\n",
      "So it was so obvious when my daughter was living with us because they would get in a lot of arguments and I could see that okay, he’s not able to uh actually stand up for himself.\n",
      "He would get upset so quickly and he would leave but at right now, he’s only kid (laughs) at home and he gets all the attention and everything.\n",
      "So and at the school would ask him if he has any issues, if there was any scenario that he thought that made him upset or anything and he always said “no, everything is fine”.\n",
      "So, so that it makes it a little bit difficult if the therapy is working or not because he’s not in it, a situation or environment that I could like “oh okay, he’s exposed to um um cases that his anxiety might kick and, so that’s why it makes it a little bit difficult for me to know if it’s working, if it’s not working because, like I said, he’s not talking a lot at home and um, there’s not a lot of interaction at home that create uh, create the environment or create a scenario that he feels like “okay, now I have to stand up for myself” or “there’s something that I need to address”.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay, um are there any questions you’d wished you’d asked before starting CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Um I think, well, because uh, because of my daughter, with my daughter has ADHD and unfortunately, we addressed it so late.\n",
      "So we uh, so that’s why we started him so early.\n",
      "So right away when I found out okay, this thing could be addressed by therapy so I said “okay, he needs to be uh uh tested”.\n",
      "But whereas for my daughter, unfortunately I didn’t do any study, I just said oh no, she’s uh um uh, if she says “I’m not focused” or she’s impulsive, it’s something that she needs to work on it and you know that’s discipline.\n",
      "So all of this but when she was, at the beginning of senior year, if I’m not mistaken, or at the end of um sophomore year, I’m sorry, junior year.\n",
      "I think we had her to be tested and they said “yes, she has ADHD” and for her, she didn’t get any, oh she, oh I’m sorry.\n",
      "She-she started getting occupational therapy as well as started medication and I saw a huge difference.\n",
      "So even though I might not be able to give you um good answers of what him because, as I said, we found right away and the environment she is-he is right now is not really stressful but for my daughter, I could say that it was phenomenal, the therapy that she got and um, medication, the combination worked very well for her.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So you would want other parents to know that they should start as soon as possible?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, exactly, as soon as possible.\n",
      "053\n",
      "00:03 Interviewer:\n",
      "Alright, so, as you know, the study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs relating to hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So the first question I want to ask you is, what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter or difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "What term... what do you mean?\n",
      "00:26 Interviewer:\n",
      "I mean like, are you okay with using hoarding disorder or would you prefer like problems with clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably since I'm not familiar with the diagnostic criteria of hoarding disorder, I would say definitely that I have a problem with clutter.\n",
      "5:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "Health and hygiene.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah, that's great.\n",
      "Okay, so now we're going to go into a more conversational part of the interview.\n",
      "So I'm just going to ask you a question and you answer it.\n",
      "Just like a conversation.\n",
      "So the first part of the first section is about your behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "So could you please describe your own problems with clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Mostly with regard to paperwork and some objects that are sentimental.\n",
      "5:39 Interviewer:\n",
      "Could you elaborate on what are these objects?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Objects like dishes or gifts perhaps if someone gave me in the past.\n",
      "Objects that have some sort of emotional charge.\n",
      "6:04 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, probably, you know, for a long time.\n",
      "Probably my whole life.\n",
      "6:18 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and how severe would you say this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I don't think it could be classified as severe.\n",
      "I think it's more something that’s an irritant or causes me to suffer a certain amount of financial harm because I can't find something, you know, maybe lose a receipt, lose a checkbook, lose something that I need for my taxes- something like that.\n",
      "7:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's not severe, but it is irritating at times.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "7:12 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, it’s a problem.\n",
      "7:21 Interviewer:\n",
      "And have you ever sought to change this behavior like gone to a professional or a counselor?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not for this specifically, not for this behavior specifically- no.\n",
      "7:36 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so not with the clutter problems then.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "7:42 Interviewer:\n",
      "And how do your family and friends feel about this behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think some of them think I should just, you know, just get over it.\n",
      "Just do it.\n",
      "And that is not helpful.\n",
      "8:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you feel like they don't understand what's going on or...\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "In some cases, yeah.\n",
      "8:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "And have you ever had conflicts with the people close to you or landlords or anyone else about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. 8:29 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so the next section is about your space and where you live.\n",
      "So could you describe where you live now and do you live alone?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I'm in a single family home, and I live with my husband and two dogs.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you mentioned recognizing symptoms of anxiety like heart racing and the reflective piece of utilizing the skills that CBT has brought.\n",
      "Are there any other skills or specific areas that CBT seems to target that seems to help build… or any thoughts or feelings or actions?\n",
      "Speaker: Well I think it is sort of a practice, realizing that it’s something that you have to work out.\n",
      "It isn’t a practice, it is almost just part of your regular health just like you need to eat food to sort of… you need to move your body.\n",
      "It’s like a part of your brain that you also have to connect with and maintain like a health sort of balance.\n",
      "So things that she’s identified for herself that sort of help her balance herself out emotionally and mentally are all things that she uses on a regular basis and makes sure she has, you know, almost like self-medicating in a way.\n",
      "Using different, you know, breathe, tapping, she does the tapping sometimes.\n",
      "Things that she can do.\n",
      "She knows music, she uses music to change things or… I guess it’s just- it’s kind of just general practices that she’s had to work into where it becomes literally its part of her everyday almost.\n",
      "So it’s like setting yourself up for success in a way.\n",
      "Whereas before, she would try to set herself up for success by avoiding anything she recognized as a trigger.\n",
      "So instead it’s almost like I’m going to take care of myself in these ways and if she ever notices, you know, I’m starting to feel these certain things, she used to get crazy headaches, and you know, just aches and pains even all throughout her body but just kind of setting the stage for success for herself in a mental way like incorporating a few of those things, I think.\n",
      "Did I answer your question again?\n",
      "I forgot where we were going.\n",
      "Interviewer: No you did.\n",
      "You gave me some very specific skills so that was perfect.\n",
      "So it sounds like she had some specific skills and it sounds like also kind of getting rid of some avoidance.\n",
      "Speaker: Alright, good… yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: It sounds like that used to be kind of the coping strategy but not-\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Well yeah and there’s also the there’s no more reassurance.\n",
      "There’s no more justifying and this very well could happen.\n",
      "So you just have to kind of own it like am I choosing to go out in the world and have a life and participate?\n",
      "Because the other options is just to stay in here and be stuck in there with the what ifs, the it’s going to, that may never play out like that kind of thing...\n",
      "Yeah, so you have to kind of be- and I think that’s the whole premise right?\n",
      "It’s kind of like you face it in a small little way and then you get some sort of alright I’m going to take a little bigger bite the next time.\n",
      "Okay, and okay so that did happen and I’m still okay.\n",
      "You know, that kind of, you know, has given her sort of a framework to work through things in a supported way.\n",
      "But also what to do when you’re not here with a bunch of support.\n",
      "How to support yourself long-term.\n",
      "Interviewer: As much as in clinic but also outside in the real world.\n",
      "Speaker: Right, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about things that are maybe on the line like using a guest room for a guest as opposed to using a guest room for storage?\n",
      "Or even going a step forward and using the surface of a desk to work on as opposed to using the surface of a desk for storage?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I would say that’s when I would consider it kind of like on the line and maybe more subclinical.\n",
      "I would, probably in that instance, take into account other things like their difficulty discarding possessions and how hard that is, and whether or not this behavior is actually just kind of, you know, let’s say [INAUDIBLE 25:50] from being at the clinical kind of level, if that makes sense?\n",
      "I would also kind of take in to maybe their impairment and how much it bothers them into my conceptualization and diagnosis.\n",
      "And once again I think that I always kind of look back and think, “they’re here for treatment, they want treatment, this is the way I’m going to treat it.”\n",
      "So, labeling it right now as hoarding disorder, whether or not they’re to some degree subclinical versus fully clinical won’t change the way in which I approach it diagnostically, it just may be easier to work with in this moment.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about home size?\n",
      "How does that figure into it?\n",
      "Interviewee: Home size?\n",
      "That’s a really great question and when I was in grad school, mu supervisor and I talked about that a lot.\n",
      "To be honest with you, I don’t think it’s hoarding if you can afford to buy a home.\n",
      "Because you may have this difficulty discarding possessions, you may have this excessive acquisition, but in that case, you likely don’t have the active clutter of the living spaces, which is to me what causes—It’s kind of like the combination the impairment that comes from that symptom.\n",
      "Interviewer: so if you can keep acquiring stuff and have it not impair your life, you don’t have a disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: That would be my thought, yeah.\n",
      "I don’t think I’ve ever thought about it as in depth as we are but yeah, I would ever say that—I mean I think about other disorders and I most of the time try to think about things in terms of when to make it a disorder is when it’s impairing.\n",
      "You know, think about even anxiety.\n",
      "If you have a significant amount of anxiety but it’s not impairing you in any way, even though I may worry about things excessively, if it doesn’t interfere with my sleep or if it doesn’t impair my relationships, is it really a disorder?\n",
      "But it’s a very fascinating and interesting question.\n",
      "Interview 016\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so now we are going to get into the more free-form interview script, and I'm just going to talk to you a little bit about, your, the ways that you distinguish hoarding disorder in your practice or research.\n",
      "I want to be respectful of your time throughout this interview so if we get close to running out of time at any point please just let me know and we will stop, okay?\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: So first I'd just like to have you briefly give me a background on your own work with hoarding disorder in terms of your educational background and also how you came to be interested in hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Well, I'm a psychologist by training, so I actually have a Ph\n",
      "D., and I have been, for a number of years, been very active in the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and related disorders.\n",
      "And something until relatively recently, hoarding was lumped in with Obsessive Compulsive disorder, and so in the context of treating people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorders one of the things I was in the position to see people who presented hoarding problems and it was considered to be Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, treating them that way.\n",
      "I have attended a number of seminars, workshops, things like that on hoarding.\n",
      "Again, most of them associated with training sponsored by or related to the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\n",
      "I met an actual OCD foundation, for example.\n",
      "The sponsors training, I’ve gone to training like that.\n",
      "I've gone to independently presented training workshops with some of the leading people in the field- NAME, NAME, people like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: And you're mostly concerned with seeing patients clinically?\n",
      "Interviewee: Excuse me?\n",
      "Interviewer: You're mostly concerned with clinical care of patients with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that’s my, my work is clinical rather than research.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so now I'd like to talk a little bit about the way that you distinguish, like when you're seeing patients, the way that you distinguish whether or not somebody has hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So for you, what are the most important differences between what could be considered normal saving behavior, perhaps such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think the most important discriminating factor is that the hoarding has gotten to the point where it’s interfering with their living situation, often a precluding safe entry or exit from their home, or causing them to not be able to use certain parts of their home, or their car for that matter.\n",
      "There’s times when people are engaging in behavior that causing them significant health risks, [INAUDIBLE 10:07) reporting falls, or sanitary risks because they’re hoarding things that are likely to become dangerous.\n",
      "Interviewer: So for you, the distinction between normal saving behavior or even, you know, borderline cases like somebody who's an extreme collector is whether their home is still safe for that and able to be used, is that correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, or they, you know, significant interference with their ability to use certain parts of their home, things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Can you think of a specific case or cases that was challenging to diagnose because you felt that it was somewhere on the borderline between pathological and non-pathological behavior.\n",
      "And could you just describe like how you, how you make a decision like that or does that never come up for you?\n",
      "Interviewee: I honestly think that the people where I’ve thought that they had hoarding disorder was really pretty clear.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So, kind of taking a step back from the DSM-5 criteria, when you think about the criteria overall, are there any elements of the criteria that you find particularly difficult to apply to patients or that you sometimes wonder that different clinicians might apply differently or that are more or less reliant on clinical judgment?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s weird for them to say that it has to include distress, to a point of distress, because the patients have so little insight and they’re so, like, self-justifying in their behavior.\n",
      "It’s usually the other people who are distressed, like the spouse or the children or the neighbors.\n",
      "It's usually not like the patient who's distressed, except for the fact that they're distressed, that everyone's bothering them about having this stuff.\n",
      "They're not usually distressed about this stuff itself as much as other people are distressed because of that.\n",
      "Interviewer: I understand.\n",
      "Interviewee: Which is a reason I think it's hard to treat because they don't show up at the clinic because they don't want help.\n",
      "They don’t want to have to get rid of their stuff, which is what you would want them to do if they showed up for help.\n",
      "So…\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, so the problem with—\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s what I think is weird.\n",
      "Interviewer: —yeah, the problem with insight prevents them from being distressed unless, unless somebody is trying to take their stuff away essentially.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer: So there's this part of the criteria where it says the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises intended use.\n",
      "And so the first part of this that I'm wondering is, it’s, from the conversation we've had so far, it sounds like to determine if someone has hoarding disorder, it really has to be obstructing their ability to use their home.\n",
      "And so I'm wondering, first of all, if somebody who, if there's a part of this that depends on how much they say have, so for instance, is it easier to be a hoarder if you live in a trailer as opposed to if you live in a huge house with multiple storage units?\n",
      "Is that a part of this distress resulting from accumulation in a space and not being able to use that space?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say no because I think people buy and still to the extent of the space and capacity for doing so.\n",
      "So like, it’s possible that somebody that has a small environment, has a lot of stuff.\n",
      "Like if you had one of those Manhattan or Japanese tiny apartments, you know, your bed and your books, and your backpack and your bike will all be, like, crammed in your space.\n",
      "And that wouldn’t be like free flowing to walk around, but it’s not full of quasi junk.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Interviewee: Like, that you should be getting rid of but refuse to, it’s filled with stuff like you actually need but you have trouble finding somewhere to put it.\n",
      "So like, if you lived in a trailer or small home you might have like, a bedroom or like an area that’s overfilled with all the random stuff you don’t know what to do with that a rich person would put in their basement or their huge garage or their huge attic.\n",
      "But it’s qualitatively distinct from somebody who has, like, piles of junk stacked high that they have to like, make it past through.\n",
      "Interview 015\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay great.\n",
      "So those are all the listing prompts that we have for you and I appreciate you going through that exercise, and again, as I explained the idea behind that is to generate these lists and to kind of be able to compare both within clinician groups, different kinds of clinicians, and to compare clinicians to patients to be able to say which ideas are most salient for different groups.\n",
      "So now we’re just going to get into a kind of semi-structure qualitative interview, and to start that off I’d just like you to give me a really brief idea of your professional background related to hoarding disorder, how you are involved with either research or treating patients with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, so I went to undergrad at [NAME 6:39] University where I majored in psychology and worked with several of the labs on campus doing research as an undergrad and became involved in a lab that studied anxiety and related disorders kind of more broadly, and so I ended up staying post my bachelor’s degree and getting a research assistant position there and a grant where I worked on anxiety treatment trials.\n",
      "During that time, I became interested in anxiety as well as some of the related conditions like OCD and hoarding, and so I ended up applying to graduate school and staying at [NAME 7:19] and working there with [NAME 7:23] who had a former student’s lab here at [NAME 7:24] clinic who also did hoarding research so I just started working with her and it became kind of an interest of mine.\n",
      "And so it was just something that clinically was fascinating to me, obviously from a research perspective was fascinating to me, and so I started developing my master’s thesis around this idea of hoarding and how maybe things in the environment like clutter might exacerbate hoarding symptoms.\n",
      "And then sent those to my [INAUDUBLE 7:52] graduate school kind of studying both hoarding and OCD, publishing a fair amount in this area and then since then am living in New Orleans working here at [NAME 8:04] as a researcher and don’t focus as much anymore on hoarding.\n",
      "This is not the primary premises of what we do at the [NAME 8:12] we see a lot more of PTSD and maybe other anxiety patients and a lot of primary depression and substance abuse, but it’s still something I kind of dabbled in.\n",
      "Also, I’ve treated a handful of patients working in graduate school in [NAME 8:25] clinic.\n",
      "We have an anxiety and behavioral health clinic, which was an outpatient clinic that services individuals on the university’s [INAUDIBLE 8:31] community and so I carried the case load of about two hoarders at the time throughout my time in graduate school working there as well so all the cases of clinical experience were kind of understanding and treating the symptoms.\n",
      "Interviewer: And in your current position do you see hoarding patients clinically?\n",
      "I know you said that it’s not your primary focus.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I do not.\n",
      "I don’t see patients at all now unless it’s a part of a treatment trial.\n",
      "I’ve decided to primarily fund myself through grants and I do have some work and some things I’m collecting right now with regards to OCD but nothing right now with regard to hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Here first?\n",
      "Okay. What was- do you remember what questions you had when you first came here?\n",
      "As far as what to expect or what did you want to know about the therapy?\n",
      "So it sounds like you had a good idea of what it entails but.\n",
      "Speaker: Well it was sort of strange because we were on the waiting list for a really long time so we ended up starting therapy with- I don’t remember it was so long ago- how it wasn’t normally done that way type situation but I don’t remember when it was supposed to be done it was like forever out long we couldn’t do it so we started seeing someone first so at first it was sort of getting a diagnosis of even what was going on and finding out that there were a combination potentially of things going.\n",
      "But I lost my train of thought again…\n",
      "Transcription Paused – Kendall\n",
      "– Transcribed by Kendall\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s okay.\n",
      "Speaker: I did not eat lunch today.\n",
      "Yeah, that’s the first water I’ve had today.\n",
      "It’s been a crazy day.\n",
      "Interviewer: I think, you know, you’re… it’s perfectly fine.\n",
      "I can definitely- I’ll rephrase that.\n",
      "But you talked about the diagnosis and it being a combination of things.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: If you could think through for me—so we’re going to move onto the next set of questions.\n",
      "The next set of questions are kind of about the DSM-5 criteria and we’re going to go into a little bit more detail about the criteria themselves.\n",
      "It sounds like you’ve applied these criteria to patients or you have applied them with the intent of diagnosis.\n",
      "Are there particular elements of the criteria themselves that you think are particularly difficult to apply or that perhaps different clinicians might apply differently?\n",
      "Maybe things to do with the language?\n",
      "Or things that are related to clinical judgement?\n",
      "Interviewee: Let me think about that for a second, that’s a good question.\n",
      "Obviously, I guess addressing impairment, for one, can be hard because the patients often times don’t acknowledge the impairment and don’t see it necessarily—which is really those that derive kind of joy or pleasure from their behaviors of acquiring and that sort of thing, and obviously find it negative to discard or find that to be distressing.\n",
      "So, I think the insight a little bit, like you kind of mentioned earlier, could be one issue with hoarding that is hard.\n",
      "I was surprised when the DSM came out that there was excessive acquisition as a specifier.\n",
      "This is my personal anecdotal evidence of treating patients and interviewing a lot of hoarders, but I have never personally come across anyone who did not have this acquiring problem or piece, and I’ve oftentimes wondered, diagnostically and from a research perspective, whether or not people who don’t have this acquiring piece if it’s really hoarding what we’re seeing or more like some sort of anhedonia or just general, kind of like [INAUDIBLE 17:48] as to why they’re not cleaning up.\n",
      "Because for most individuals with hoarding disorder, there is always an acquisition piece present, it’s not something that would just be a specifier, there is this kind of pleasure or joy that’s derived from buying things or collecting things or obtaining free things, and it would be hard for me to imagine an instance in which hoarding occurs without some sort of acquisition.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay, that makes sense.\n",
      "Yeah, that totally makes sense.\n",
      "Okay, so now I'd like to think through, if you recall the list that we generated, of reasons that patients give for their hoarding behaviors.\n",
      "So, you know, we had given things like believing the object will be useful later, attaching too much emotional significance to objects.\n",
      "I’m wondering, if in your mind, these explanations that patients give are kind of their root of hoarding disorder, or do you think that these are post hoc justifications that the patients have kind of come up with to rationalize what's essentially a need to save things?\n",
      "So do they save things because of these reasons or are these reasons generated because they save things, if that makes sense?\n",
      "Interviewee: I actually think that almost all mental disorders, I don’t know if you’re familiar with acceptance therapy but this idea that, personally, all mental disorders involve, in part, experiential avoidance.\n",
      "Okay, and that means that, you know, people are engaging in what amounts to maladaptive behaviors in effort to not feel, usually anxiety or other uncomfortable emotions but sometimes even positive emotions.\n",
      "And I think that’s really a good way of understand hoarding as well as most other disorders so that, and the other thing I think is that people make up explanations for why they do things when you ask them, they may not have them, even if they have, they may not really understand why they’re doing things that they’re doing, really because in their experience, or their understanding of the world, it seems they’re avoiding or escaping uncomfortable feelings.\n",
      "If giving things away or disposing of things is uncomfortable, they’re going to avoid doing it.\n",
      "If you ask them way they don’t do it, they come up with a reason.\n",
      "Interviewer: So for you it seems that it’s more of a post hoc justification, but that there’s still avoidance based reasons for why they do things.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Anything can be avoidance.\n",
      "It’s not really thought through until you ask them.\n",
      "You know, then they come up with a reason.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Another question and we're coming to the close of our interview.\n",
      "I appreciate you sticking with me.\n",
      "So one of the big questions and I have about hoarding disorder is about the life course of hoarders because so many people tend to be identified relatively late in life.\n",
      "And I wonder if you have any sense for your patients how long their behavior has typically been going on before you see them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, for most people it probably starts much earlier in life than we ever know about it.\n",
      "And it may be minimized because they’re not in control of most of their life circumstances in the the younger years.\n",
      "And it may start to get dramatically worse in later stages of life, again, because their reduced influences by other people that would curtail it.\n",
      "So that if people, you know, become…Lose their partner, for example, in later life, there’s no counteractive force with the other person saying “what a minute, you’ve got to get rid of some of this stuff.”\n",
      "Or, it seems like that or they’re alone anyway.\n",
      "So, no real counteractive interactions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So it sounds like some little bit about this disorder is social and has to do with isolation, which is perhaps…\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that increases it, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: I mean I guess there’s also a cause and effect problem—\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well, that brings us really nicely into the next part of the interview where I’d like to ask you a little bit about your thoughts on insight.\n",
      "So how do you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think insight is multi-dimensional.\n",
      "You know, that’s why there’s that scale the BABS, Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale, that looks at a number of different aspects of insight because it’s not just one thing.\n",
      "It’s insight into the specific nature of your thoughts and predictions and beliefs, maybe in this particular case about the items and do you actually need to keep them or not, and there’s insight into whether you have a disorder or not, there’s insight into whether you understand that your behavior would be considered strange or weird or pathological by other people even if you don’t think so.\n",
      "There’s a little bit of different (INAUDIBLE, 49:18).\n",
      "Do you think it’s psychological problem or do you think it’s caused by something else?\n",
      "So there’s different dimensions there.\n",
      "I think you actually have to sit down and ask those questions and really do a more careful assessment of insight in people with hoarding disorder and it’s difficult.\n",
      "I personally found it difficult.\n",
      "I tried to use that scale, the BABS, in people with hoarding disorder and it was really hard because it wouldn’t identify any specific belief.\n",
      "Everything was a might.\n",
      "“Well, I might need it someday.”\n",
      "“Well, do you believe you will need it someday?” “I don’t know, I might.”\n",
      "Well yes, and so you couldn’t pin them down and say yes I believe it or no I don’t believe it in a way that you could say, “Is it really contaminated?\n",
      "Are you really going to get sick if you don’t wash your hands?\n",
      "Do you really believe that your face is distorted and ugly?” And we tried it a number of times and it was really difficult, so we kind of do it non-specifically and I’ve developed, we’ve developed, some other sorts of questions that get at the nature and insight of hoarding and put them in our hoarding severity scale.\n",
      "(INAUDIBLE, 50:31) because we don’t know how valid it will end up being.\n",
      "But I ask all of those things.\n",
      "I ask, “do you think you have a problem?\n",
      "Do you think you have a psychological disorder or not?\n",
      "Do you think that you really do need to keep all of this stuff?” I’ll ask them, “what percentage of all of the clutter in your home do you really think that you need?” and then even then you get a wishy-washy answer sometimes.\n",
      "You’ll say well do I need or do I want?\n",
      "I may want a lot of it, but I realize I truly only need some of them.\n",
      "But we don’t always just keep what we need, sometimes we keep what we want and what if I want a lot.\n",
      "So it can be very difficult to pin down exactly how much insight they have and how much they don’t have and a lot of people are in between.\n",
      "But with some level of insight impairment and maybe a little overvalued ideation and what I’ve found is that that often changes with psycho-education and really discussing it and getting into a discussion about what’s driving it and having them start to do cognitive restructuring about what would happen if you didn’t have this whole pile of old newspapers from twenty-years ago.\n",
      "Would it really actually be a problem or would it just be something anxiety provoking or understand you would feel angry because there’s a loss, but would it actually impact your life?\n",
      "Once you start doing that you start actually affecting their insight and their cognitions because you’re challenging stuff, you’re asking particular questions that get at that.\n",
      "So it’s the effect of the observer and the interviewer on what they’re actually measuring.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "An example could be in this recent COVID lockdown, I spent a number of months back at home instead of this workplace.\n",
      "And, um, I found that the actual work items I was handling were more suited to one- or two-hundred square feet of office space rather than four- or six-hundred feet of workspace, and that I didn’t need to refer to nearly any of the stuff that’s in here., I’m in my office space today, and I’ve been walking through the wreckage and possibly putting paper into the recycling bin.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:20): Okay.\n",
      "So, you kind of moved away from your things and your workspace for a while, and it made you realize that you didn’t necessarily need all of them.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It was more apparent.\n",
      "And, I, uh, in the course of clearing a way to my desk I put a number of things into the recycling.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:42): Okay.\n",
      "So, in terms of your problems with clutter, have you every sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Like have you ever gone to a professional for help?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I hired a young woman to come in for a couple of days— probably 15 years ago— to clear and clean.\n",
      "And, um, I still have some of her labels on my walls.\n",
      "But, it was incomplete.\n",
      "An incomplete effort.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:21): Okay.\n",
      "So, you’ve never had any sort of traditional therapy or counseling for it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. Interviewer (11:27): Okay.\n",
      "And, so, when you had this person come in to help you organize, did this cause you any distress?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I don’t think it caused me distress.\n",
      "That occurred in conjunction with, uh, I participated in a 12-step recovery group.\n",
      "And, um, part of the benefit of that process is uncomfortable truths.\n",
      "Part of addressing recovery is to address uncomfortable truths in an inventory process, and you’re inventorying stuff in your head as well as stuff in your life.\n",
      "And, um, so I’ve been trying to apply those principles to, um, not just stuck in my head but stuck in my life.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:27): Right.\n",
      "So, can you tell me a little bit more about that 12-step process you went through?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It occurs in church basements usually.\n",
      "One of the names is Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.\n",
      "And, um, people meet who have a common problem and common desire to uh, an unmedicated life.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:04): Okay.\n",
      "So, it was intended to help you with the hoarding, but you underwent that activity with bringing someone else in as part of the process to help you with that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "There’s an analogous or uh, a coincidental benefit to cleaning up my life, included also cleaning up my space.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:27): Gotcha.\n",
      "And, so, after you had that person come in and help you organize, how long did things stay organized?\n",
      "Or how long until things started to get bad again with the clutter?\n",
      "Interviewer: Now we’re going to talk about the DSM-5 criteria, which I'm sure you, you're aware of how those were developed and probably were involved in, in those discussions.\n",
      "I just wanted to first start by asking if you have occasion to apply the DSM-5 criteria in your practice.\n",
      "I assume you do.\n",
      "Interviewee: [INAUDIBLE 15:37) I can’t quite hear.\n",
      "Interviewer: Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "It got a little loud in here.\n",
      "I was just wondering if you use, I assume that you use the DSM five criteria in your practice with the intent of diagnosing an individual with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Do you find that there are particular elements of the criteria that you regard is particularly difficult to apply or that you worry sometimes that it could be applied differently by different clinicians?\n",
      "Perhaps things that are related to …\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that sort of generally true with the DSM, but I think they’re, they’re reasonably clear.\n",
      "You know, let me reach into my desk here for my DSM.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I have them.\n",
      "I can read them to you if you’d like.\n",
      "Interviewee: I actually turn to the right page, I...\n",
      "If you want to read them that, that would probably make it easier.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, sure.\n",
      "So, where did, I was just going to go through a couple of key phrases and ask you about the way that you think about them.\n",
      "The first is, persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value.\n",
      "And I wonder, I guess about the question of actual value, and how, or if you ever worry about that in terms of patients who are saving particular kinds of things that maybe are not, you know, worthless garbage or that are saving things that have sentimental value that, you know, that might be subjective or difficult to determine.\n",
      "Do you ever struggle with the idea of a hoarder’s possessions, having actual value?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, you know, some people obviously are saving things that, that do have some financial value that could be sold or, you know, could be collected, kind of thing.\n",
      "And…\n",
      "Interviewer: So if, if a hoarder has a collection or a hoard of items that are, you know, objectively valuable, but are just excessive.\n",
      "How does that fit into this criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah but, but they’re, they’re still collecting or hoarding in a way that doesn’t, treats that actual value in a way that makes sense.\n",
      "They’re not selling them off or, you know, whatever, making profit off of it.\n",
      "Typically, we get piles of stuff that they think have more, much more value, than most people are going to think typically.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewee: It looks like, at least a reasonable amount of time they’re not treating it the way I would expect people to rationally treat things in terms of their value.\n",
      "Interviewer: So when you say rationally treat things in terms of their value, you mean, they might have a collection of objectively valuable items, but rather than, you know, selling them or displaying them, they just accumulate them.\n",
      "Interviewee: They pile them in a corner somewhere.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: The last question I want to ask is also a hard question to answer and I just kind of want to hear you think through it.\n",
      "Do you think that hoarding disorder and the things that kind of play into people’s acquisition and keeping things, do you think that there is an aspect to which cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions and ownership, do you think that there’s any association between those two kinds of ideas in hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it would be hard for there not to be.\n",
      "Yeah, I think there definitely is.\n",
      "I mean I know hoarding can exist in the absence of these things and it’s something that’s been around for a really long time and doesn’t necessarily, I know that the early conceptualizations or theories about hoarding and its arising from not having a lot or being less fortunate has never [INAUDIBLE 45:23] in the literature but I can’t help but think that the culture and the ay that they live now and this idea of being able to readily consume things doesn’t feed into that or doesn’t exacerbate a problem that we have.\n",
      "You know just think about attention deficit in children and how they’re like, there are a probably more things drawing their attention now than there would’ve been decades ago and how that maybe has influenced the course or the nature of the disorder and how we see it.\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess kind of along those lines, have you seen instances in which either hoarding disorder—these days there’s a lot of talk about associating memories with items through souvenirs or through photographs.\n",
      "I guess it’s not really a new thing but culturally there’s a lot of association with needing to save memories as physicals objects as opposed to just saving memories.\n",
      "Do you think that that could have anything to do with the development of hoarding disorder, just because it seems like many hoarders talk about their possessions in terms of memory and forgetting?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and what’s the question?\n",
      "I’m sorry, I get where you’re going but what was the actual question?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, no, I guess I just wanted to talk about that or to see if you had any thoughts on that issue of if you had encountered that?\n",
      "Interviewee: I definitely have, I mean thinking about Mardi Gras like I said earlier, almost like every memory she had of Mardi Gras would be erased if she got rid of all the cups or maybe all the cups but one.\n",
      "She was very fearful that she would forget about that time, which I just found interesting.\n",
      "Interviewer: And it’s interesting because it doesn’t sound like the cups were necessarily a reminder that the event existed, but more something in between, you know what I mean, more of like a physical acknowledgement.\n",
      "Interviewee: Representation of that, yes.\n",
      "Yeah, I also remember her not being able to get rid of any wrapping paper that had been given to her, like as a gift from a friend, she had saved every bit of wrapping paper, any gift that was given to her she had saved the wrapping paper that went around the gift even if the wrapping paper had been torn off and couldn’t be used again it because it was a reminder of that friend and the gift and almost like she wouldn’t remember the friend, or it would be a spite to the friend if she got rid of it, which was very interesting to me.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well there’s the television, and there’s more just the general culture I think , than any kind of scientific journal.\n",
      "I’ve read book on organization by trying to fix it by, you know, developing a technique or something before I realized that it was not...\n",
      "It was deeper than having lack of knowledge.\n",
      "So, you know, I would read books about how to organize this or that.\n",
      "21:57 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that’s interesting, and what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I’ve had a tenant once who was definitely a hoarder, and we had to evict her from the rental property because of her behavior, so I think about that.\n",
      "22:23 Interviewer:\n",
      "So her behavior was so severe you had to evict her?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "22:29 Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow, okay, so that's interesting.\n",
      "What kind of things were going on that you had to evict her, like what was she doing that made it so severe?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well this was a house that was a shotgun house, and the house was almost packed from ceiling to floor with stuff, you could barely get through it, and I was worried about the actual structure of the house because she would put shelving and then put heavy objects on the shelves, which I thought would stress the wall and the floor joists, because there was just so much stuff.\n",
      "I mean, she has a lot of pottery.\n",
      "The pottery, from what I remember, was heavy and causing me concern about that.\n",
      "And then of course there's fire.\n",
      "And then of course there was rodents.\n",
      "23:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "So it was definitely a safety concern as much as a structural concern.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "23:46 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, wow, that’s very interesting.\n",
      "So our next section is about distress and interference.\n",
      "So does your clutter upset you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "24:04 Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you think it gets in the way of your daily life.\n",
      "Could you elaborate on why it upsets you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think that there might be a circumstance where I would need to lay my hands on something quickly and I wouldn't be able to do it.\n",
      "I might buy something that I already have, because I can't find it, and that you know it's wasteful, and it's not pleasant to look at.\n",
      "Like, right now, I'm looking at, oh 1, 2, 3 boxes that are in my living room that you know I'm not using them for anything.\n",
      "They're not pretty to look at...\n",
      "24:51 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so it causes you distress, because you don't like to look at it, and it might be a financial harm as well.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, and uh it makes me feel like I’m crazy when I know that I have something and I can't find it so it causes me emotional stress because I feel like I'm losing my mind when I think I've just put something down and now it's missing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So there's a resistance to the idea of discarding.\n",
      "So this is a question that I think will be particularly interesting to ask you.\n",
      "So can you think of cases, either a specific case or multiple specific cases, that was a challenge to decide or to diagnose clinically or in research because it was really right on that border between pathological and non-pathological behavior or some subclinical?\n",
      "Did you ever…?\n",
      "Interviewee: What’s the question exactly?\n",
      "I understand the context, I was, what’s the question?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Just to have you talk through a specific case that was particularly difficult to decide whether or not it constituted hoarding disorder and how you ended up making the decision, of what, of what it was or what it wasn't.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, for example, we have cases where people have extremely full areas of the house, like a garage or basement or an attic.\n",
      "And they’re, like, very emotional and resistant to help in the same way that I described.\n",
      "But like, they have a fairly normal, maybe cluttered, but fairly normal living environment, or like most of the rooms that are fine, just cluttered.\n",
      "So there’s like, distress in the family, there’s, like, stress and extra work times by the number of items.\n",
      "There’s obviously a problem with having too many, and having trouble letting go.\n",
      "But it’s not to a degree where anyone needs to, like, call the police.\n",
      "Like, they’re like [INAUDIBLE 11:40) managing because they’re separating, like, storage areas from living areas.\n",
      "And so I wouldn’t call that hoarding disorder, I would just call that like hoarding problem, let’s say, or tendency.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it really is a matter of how much of their spaces is used up.\n",
      "And so for you—\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: —the kind of more borderline cases are cases where much of the space is used up or a significant amount of space, but not all of it.\n",
      "There's still some somehow balancing they're hoarding tendencies with the need to use their space normally.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what about cases that exist either concomitantly or are difficult to distinguish from other mental disorders such as like, a patient who is depressed, who is having trouble discarding or a patient who has Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and is having trouble discarding.\n",
      "Do you find that those distinctions are difficult to make?\n",
      "Interviewee: Not really.\n",
      "I think that people commonly have hoarding with anxiety and depression and OCD.\n",
      "So even though it can be considered its own thing, it is so often concurrent with these disorders that if they have the house full of junk, then I would just consider it hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "What about a case in which people are saving only particular kinds of items?\n",
      "So their house is completely filled with like sports memorabilia or something like that, but not indiscriminate items?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "I don’t think I would call that hoarding disorder because it’s so rare for someone with a particular proclivity to actually overfill the home to the point where they can’t use it.\n",
      "Like, it’s just not normally the case like with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "You know, it’s like they say in one of the diagnosis quotes to the point of including things with little to no value.\n",
      "And, so like, somebody who was a collector, even if it’s a lot of stuff, and it takes up a lot of space.\n",
      "I think it very rarely passes that threshold.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it may not necessarily…\n",
      "Speaker: Numbers like I always feel like that gives validity to something when you can put a value on it and numbers tend to do that.\n",
      "Interviewer: When you say numbers or statistics, can you clarify what that would be like?\n",
      "Is that some kind of percentage of something or is that some other?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, maybe.\n",
      "Maybe, I like percentage but I also like bar graphs or pie charts.\n",
      "Interviewer: Pie charts?\n",
      "Speaker: You know, a quick understandable- because I would think if you’re looking at options, you know, there would be other types of therapies that you could do as well.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Some kind of comparison?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "I think, I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s perfectly- perfectly fine.\n",
      "Speaker: They’ll have to shop everything now and sort of compare.\n",
      "Interviewer: Everyone’s kind of like a consumer of multiple things.\n",
      "Speaker: Right.\n",
      "Well I mean just even, this is sort of, you know, you have to be active in this.\n",
      "It’s not a pill you can swallow but you can also swallow pills that will help you through some of these things and it can be a conjunction.\n",
      "I could see, you know, just presenting in anyway, especially if you’re trying to convince people to go the route of it, which I would think would be the thing is showing it in a beneficial light in comparison to just medication or talk therapy or I don’t even know if that’s what it’s called but that’s what I call it.\n",
      "Something else to give it, kind of, a measurement- a visual measurement like something- yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Visual- okay, some visual representation and something that’s maybe measureable or something like that.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Alright.\n",
      "Speaker: An infographic.\n",
      "You know people love infographics.\n",
      "Like really really [35:29]\n",
      ".\n",
      "Interviewer: No!\n",
      "I get what you’re saying.\n",
      "Yeah, an infographic, people do like infographics it seems.\n",
      "Okay and you said you didn’t really know about anyone else’s experiences with CBT, right?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Not coming into it.\n",
      "Now I do but not a whole lot.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: But because of my position I end up talking- because I’m involved with so many children and so many families and often working with different families and children- not my child but, you know, somebody else and learning okay so we were here before and now because- you know- I’ve had parents mention before that they are doing CBT with their children on different\n",
      "Speaker: you know, oh my gosh you should… and I’ll be like yes isn’t it amazing!\n",
      "Or you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like it was mostly positive?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes!\n",
      "I’ve never heard anything negative.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well we do like- we love to hear that.\n",
      "No but- right.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t hear a lot about it.\n",
      "But it’s not like I’ve never heard anybody be oh this was horrible and the biggest waste of time, now we’re really messed up.\n",
      "Interviewer: Gotcha.\n",
      "I mean and if it did-\n",
      "Speaker: If it did-\n",
      "Interviewer: It would be good to know, right?\n",
      "Speaker: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like pretty much all positive even the little bit that you’ve heard.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Alright so we’re almost at the part where we’ll talk about specifically the video.\n",
      "This last question; when you first learned about it, which again I know we’re going back a little bit, think of three words to describe how you felt about CBT?\n",
      "Or if you can, what those words would be.\n",
      "For describing CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: I think the only thing I can think of is, you know, sort of tongue and cheek.\n",
      "It’s just like-\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s okay.\n",
      "It can be like if what came to your mind for describing it when you first found out about it or how you felt about it if it’s sort of tongue and cheek, that’s okay.\n",
      "That’s your personal answer.\n",
      "Speaker: It just seems obvious like it’s almost so easy- it seems so obvious.\n",
      "Duh- why wouldn’t you treat it this way?\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so obvious.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, we talked earlier in the interview and generated a list of explanations and reasons that individuals with hoarding disorder give for their saving behavior and kind of zeroed in on that emotional attachment to items as kind of a key component of what constitutes a disorder.\n",
      "I’m wondering if you feel in dealing with patients and doing research on this that these justifications that people give are themselves the root of the disorder or are these kind of post hoc rationalizations for some kind of underlying biological need or that people save the item first and them come up with the “oh maybe I’ll use it someday” or if the “maybe I’ll use it someday” is really the key.\n",
      "So is it more of a cognitive driven or more of a, I don’t know, I guess my question is breaking down so I’ll let you answer it.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think different patients do have different motivations or different combinations.\n",
      "Sometimes I’ll ask people, “How much of this stuff is stuff that you really hung on to because you thought you needed some day or might needed someday or might be useful or valuable and how much of it was for more for sentimental reason or memorabilia?” and I would say most people have some of each.\n",
      "There’s a few who only have one or only have another, but most people have some of each.\n",
      "Sometimes the stuff is all jumbled together so they can’t even really piece it apart.\n",
      "I don’t think that those attachments and those perceptions or cognitions about that either create distress or anxiety about not sure that I might need it or not.\n",
      "I think those are a root, I don’t think that they are post hoc things.\n",
      "I think again because they are in fact all on a continuum with what we consider normal saving.\n",
      "All of us save some stuff that’s memorabilia and almost all of us will save some things, or the things that we do save are things that we usually think we’re going to need.\n",
      "I think what’s happening in hoarding disorder is that those perceptions and beliefs and then the emotions that come with those perceptions and belief are magnified and they’re spread over lots and lots and lots of items rather than just a few.\n",
      "So if you ask people, “what receipts do you save?” and somebody might say, “I only save the receipts from the last one year because I might need them for taxes.\n",
      "Once the year goes by and I’ve done my taxes I toss those out and we’ll save the next year.”\n",
      "Whereas a person with hoarding disorder might say, “Well I don’t know.\n",
      "Maybe I might need all of them.\n",
      "So I’ve saved all of the receipts going back to twenty years because I’m not sure.\n",
      "It’s too much anxiety to make that decision to throw away and so I just avoid it.”\n",
      "So it’s the intensity of the emotion attached to those perceptions.\n",
      "It’s that it becomes pathological so it applies to a whole bunch of different items where most other people would say, “No that’s ridiculous.\n",
      "Of course you can’t save or there’s no way you logically are going to be able to use those broken electrical cords from a broken lamp.”\n",
      "But the feeling is there and that part of it is the part that I think is similar to the process that you see in OCD and that’s the part of it that I think qualifies hoarding disorder as sort of an OCD-related disorder.\n",
      "That is the aspect of the phenomenology that I think is closest to OCD whereas other parts aren’t necessarily.\n",
      "But I think those feelings and emotions and the anxiety that goes along with the ability to decide or the fear that you might lose something that you might need someday, or that issue about waste that (NAME 1:03:16) described about having, lots of people feeling like I would like these items to be used and I don’t want to feel like things should go to waste, but he wouldn’t necessarily have such an intense feeling of that attached to so many different objects that were lots of things you couldn’t throw away.\n",
      "So the difference is in degree, the intensity of the emotions and beliefs, are they kind of distorted and applied to lots of different things as opposed to just a few things for most of us.\n",
      "Interviewer: You mentioned earlier that you have patients frequently that come into your clinics who are away that their behavior constitutes a problem and I wonder if you know or if you have talked to them about how they reach that state of high insight on their own.\n",
      "If it was mostly externally driven, if it was mostly internally driven, how did people get there?\n",
      "Interviewee: So almost everybody in our clinic who has hoarding disorder is there because they know they have hoarding disorder.\n",
      "There’s only a couple because the people who don’t have insight won’t come.\n",
      "They’ll either refuse or they’ll come in once because they were dragged there and then will never come again, because they don’t believe they have a problem.\n",
      "So almost by definition everybody who continues in a treatment or a research study is somebody knows they’ve got a problem with this.\n",
      "And I think the pathways to that realization are probably a lot of different ones.\n",
      "Sometimes it’s because they watched a show or read a book about it.\n",
      "Sometimes it’s because other people have been working on them for years saying I think you’ve got a problem you really need to get some help for this, why don’t you call a professional organizer, why don’t you get some help.\n",
      "It could be because it was identified in the context of some other disorder.\n",
      "They came in for depression and then somebody found out they had hoarding problems.\n",
      "Most of the time it’s been on their own.\n",
      "The individual or family being the kind of the most important people, much less often are referrals from other clinicians.\n",
      "In fact, it’s been dismayed that we don’t get more referrals from clinicians and certainly not from those housing authorities and fire departments.\n",
      "There’s a lot of those task forces that have civil authorities of whatever kind and at least the ones in (NAME, 54:06) they never refer the patients.\n",
      "We’ve gone and done talks with them explaining okay it’s a disorder you need to treat it and find these people and get them into treatment but they don’t refer the people.\n",
      "So, unfortunately, we don’t get nearly enough referrals from those external sources.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Like do you think they should find out about the CBT explanation about CBT can become a problem in someone else’s life?\n",
      "Speaker: I think that would be great, yeah, because I think that some parents might uh feel like okay, it’s nothing.\n",
      "Because I had this conversation with a couple of my colleagues before having my son to be tested.\n",
      "I said my son was like this, he did this, I don’t know why he’s doing it.\n",
      "And my colleague said oh you know, it’s just the age, it’s just a phase, you know, it’s a phase, it’s going to uh go away.\n",
      "Eventually, they going to learn.\n",
      "So eventually going to learn, yes they might but um if there is something that can make the lives of our kids easier, why shouldn’t we do it?\n",
      "So I think it’s very important that uh saying that if you don’t address something maybe as simple as anxiety, what are the impacts it’s going to have?\n",
      "It’s going to impact their confidence, it’s going to impact uh on their relationships, uh it could be personal relationships, could be friendship.\n",
      "So I think yeah, definitely.\n",
      "And I think it’s very important that show parents that they shouldn’t make like, they shouldn’t think that oh it’s something that is going to go away by itself.\n",
      "In my case, I thought oh okay, it’s just the sibling but not for my son, as I said, for my daughter.\n",
      "No, you have to work hard [\n",
      "], you know?\n",
      "At this point I feel like if there is something that could help our kids’ lives easier, you should do it.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So you show them that there is an option that is available to them?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Helps make their kids’ lives easier?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So, should they talk about how it’s worked for other kids?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I think so, yeah.\n",
      "Especially address for that you might not get a lot of, you know, good feedbacks, in terms of if it has worked or not, because, as I said we, [\n",
      "] so early for him and then it’s so early in the process, but other parents that uh you have had this interview and uh their feedbacks and what worked for them, I think that would be great if you include it without mentioning the names or\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Right, right.\n",
      "Um, and uh should they ask about what parents can and can’t do to help?\n",
      "Speaker: Um … I, I think so.\n",
      "Yeah, I think showing that their involvement is going to be important, yeah but at the same time, not making it oh okay.\n",
      "Because some parents say oh then why I’m bringing my kid to the therapy if I’m going to be as involved?\n",
      "So it should be the way that, you know what, if you want to see the great impact then you need to be engaged.\n",
      "So not making it oh okay so, I don’t know.\n",
      "Some parents say no, if I’m going to have the therapy to help my kid, so why should I be involved?\n",
      "So then why should I pay?\n",
      "So I’m going to do it myself.\n",
      "So making it that, you know what, it’s going to make the loves of both parents and kids’ easier but it requires some involvement and support.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Support.\n",
      "Okay, so now we get to the fun part where we get to decide how the videos will look.\n",
      "So, first of all, are there any cartoons or animated movies that you like?\n",
      "Speaker: Um … well, I know that kids like … Me, I don’t watch um like animated movies or cartoons but I think kids could be the one could give good examples.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So I have three options here and you can take a minute to flip through them.\n",
      "And then, after you’ve looked through them, could you let me know which style you like the most?\n",
      "Speaker: Okay …\n",
      "Interviewer: The last thing I’d like to ask you about is that there are kind of these, I don’t know if they’re folk-knowledge about hoarding disorder or intuitions that some people have, that hoarding disorder is related to consumption and overconsumption and perhaps a cultural move towards overconsumption and having storage units and having so much stuff.\n",
      "I’m wondering if you feel like that is valid at all?\n",
      "If there is anything to that idea?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say I don’t think so.\n",
      "I think those issues certainly play a role in how it manifests.\n",
      "So the fact that more and more people live in isolation in our country as compared to Europe or compared to the United States from fifty-years-ago when there were more like multi-individual families rather than a whole bunch of people in their fifties living alone because they’re divorced and there’s nobody around.\n",
      "So social isolation has increased in our culture and our country and that plays a role.\n",
      "But I think hoarding symptoms have been identified all across the world including people who are very poor or are not in consumer-based societies and that’s why I think the core features that drive the disorder are present regardless of ethnicity and culture, but the way it gets manifested, sure.\n",
      "Like you mentioned, the size of peoples’ homes, we live in these giant homes now, so there’s lots of space and external storage units are a thing.\n",
      "They’ve increased dramatically.\n",
      "I read some news story about that industry and they’re making millions and millions of dollars because so many more people in the United States, all across the country, are wanting and using external storage units.\n",
      "So they’re popping up all over the place.\n",
      "So yeah that's a cultural thing that certainly effects how this manifests, but I think that those are the things on the outside.\n",
      "Those are the things that influence the way that the disorder takes shape and the way that different influences are exacerbated or promoted, but I don’t think that’s the source at all.\n",
      "Interviewer: And kind of the second thing that people say sometimes about hoarding disorder is that it’s related to early experiences of scarcity or somebody who’s experienced poverty and therefore reacts to it by having so much stuff and again is there anything to that idea in your experience.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, there isn’t.\n",
      "That actually has been something that (NAME 1:06:30) did do a paper on that and maybe a few other groups have taken a look at that too.\n",
      "It does not appear to be correlated with early life deprivation or people used to talk about it’s only going to be in the Depression Era of people, the greatest generation that went through the Depression because they were povorous and that’s not true either.\n",
      "If you look at different cohorts, birth cohorts, it’s about the same.\n",
      "It can be seen in wealthy people and in poor people, people who grew up wealthy, people who grew up poor, so I think that one is getting refuted.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah. It’s just- but it’s almost making things too hard or too whatever, you know.\n",
      "Trying to think of things.\n",
      "It doesn’t have to be so complicated like it’s actually a pretty simple step one, step two.\n",
      "It’s just a process and can be a fairly short process.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "I would almost say lather, rinse, repeat.\n",
      "It’s literally-that’s what your shampoo says- that’s what women shampoo says maybe guy’s shampoo – everyone’s shampoo probably says the same thing.\n",
      "It’s shampoo.\n",
      "But like…\n",
      "Interviewer: So I heard obvious, simple, and what was the third one?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "I don’t know I guess quick.\n",
      "Interviewer: Quick?\n",
      "Speaker: We could do that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So obvious, simple, and quick.\n",
      "They don’t have to be- this is kind of just how you felt.\n",
      "Speaker: I know.\n",
      "Marketing ads, that was my previous job.\n",
      "All this advertising and graphic design that’s what I always wanted.\n",
      "I wanted it to be something cheesy like it’s all brain but it’s a no brainer.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Type situation.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, that makes sense.\n",
      "That’s kind of a fun tagline.\n",
      "Okay so for those three words that we did come up with and we can do another one for the “it’s all”- what was it?\n",
      "It’s all brain but a no brainer.\n",
      "Are there any visuals that you think that would be or good pictures that you think would accompany those pictures?\n",
      "Just kind of thinking from a video perspective sometimes it’s nice to put pictures.\n",
      "And it can be one for each one or it could be one for as a group.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah… I’m like flat lined now.\n",
      "I don’t know- I can’t.\n",
      "I mean like…\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Can you rephrase you question?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah!\n",
      "I’ll try to chop it up a little bit.\n",
      "So if we were to put obvious as a word, what kind of image comes to mind?\n",
      "What kind of picture?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t have any, which is so funny.\n",
      "Interviewer: Nothing?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: There is no picture.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Static, there’s just static.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, what about- does anything come to mind for simple?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about quick?\n",
      "Speaker: A stopwatch?\n",
      "That’s the only thing that pops into my mind.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, a stopwatch?\n",
      "Okay and what about it’s all brain but it’s a no brainer?\n",
      "Just wondering if there is any image that you can think of that associates with that.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah like all comedy things.\n",
      "Interviewer: Just something funny?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I can almost see taking out your, and not in a gory way, taking your brain out of your head and rocking it, giving it a hug, you know, just taking care of yourself kind of in a way.\n",
      "Just all cheesy things.\n",
      "Just want to bedazzle it, I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Cheesy is fine.\n",
      "Speaker: That’s what you get right now.\n",
      "That’s what I’m bringing.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s okay.\n",
      "That’s alright.\n",
      "Alright, so were going to talk about the videos and then some of the fun part of kind of how they could look.\n",
      "So, I’ll kind of go through a few questions regarding that and then I have some templates for you to look at.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Kind of what your thoughts are so first thing we need to do is decide who would be in the videos.\n",
      "What kind of characters do you think we should include?\n",
      "Speaker: I almost feel like if its kid based, I would almost feel like it would be not… you’re doing a cartoon.\n",
      "Didn’t you say you’re doing a cartoon so it’s going to be animated?\n",
      "Interviewer: There- we’re not entirely sure but we are- I think the idea is animated.\n",
      "Speaker: I think for adults would be more drawn to, you know, actual people.\n",
      "But kids are used to everything animated.\n",
      "Interviewer: So for kids maybe something animated but for adults maybe live action or real people, I guess.\n",
      "For lack of a better word.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: So not animated?\n",
      "Speaker: Maybe.\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a very good question.\n",
      "So, the question is, just to make sure I’m understanding, how do I determine?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, the criteria itself reads, “regardless of actual value” and so I guess I’m wondering when you talk to a patient with hoarding disorder, what is your criteria for determining their ability to value items?\n",
      "I mean, inappropriate valuation is…how do you see that in a patient?\n",
      "How do you determine if a patient is appropriately valuing items?\n",
      "Interviewee: I guess sometimes it’s in the number of things that they evaluate as valuable.\n",
      "I think it’s clear that we all value certain things… an example would be, I don’t have a child but I imagine I my mother has saved some of my childhood things, but didn’t save every single thing.\n",
      "You know, it’s part of my childhood so it’s understanding that like there are certain things that you should save because they remind you of this time or this place but everything may not be necessarily needed or saved.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, so this criterion which says, “difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of actual value” maybe more means that some things have more value than others?\n",
      "That’s what you’re looking for as a normal ability to value items?\n",
      "And not so much that they correctly value valuable items and throw away trash, you know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah that somethings have more—yeah that’s a good way to put it.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so the next one that I’d like to talk through with you is, “the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromise?\n",
      "And how do you determine, for example, if a person lives in a trailer vs if the person has the ability to have a very big house with two or three rooms for storage, how does that play into your ability to make a diagnosis of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that’s a really good question, one that I’ve thought about a lot.\n",
      "So, in terms of the number of “how this or that kind of thing”, I mean, to me, if someone can use—I guess for the intended use, my main problem there is “can you perform activity that have to do with living?” I think with geriatric patients, are you able to shower?\n",
      "Brush your teeth?\n",
      "Can you use your toilet?\n",
      "Are you able to have a bed that you can sleep in or a place that you can sleep?\n",
      "Can you heat up or fix yourself a meal in your home?\n",
      "So, I would say basic kinds of everyday needs like shelter, food, hygiene, clothing, that kind of stuff are the things that I’m looking for in terms of “intended use”.\n",
      "So, it’s less important to me if your house is cluttered and dusty if you can do those things.\n",
      "So, you can have a conflict with a spouse, for instance, that your house is extremely cluttered and yucky but if you can kind of use your house for all intended purposes that you would need it for, in terms of like being able to, like I said, sleep, eat, and shower and take care of those kinds of things, to me that certain criteria is not met unless you cannot do those things\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, like I said, that's kind of a speculative question, that's not really a testable one.\n",
      "So, as I'm sure you're aware in the literature, hoarding disorder is described as something that primarily occurs in elderly people but there's more and more research about how it emerges over the course of a person's life, and from your clinical experience, do you have any sense of how the disorder develops?\n",
      "You know like, how long it's been going on before people come to see you, if people talk about it being something in their life their whole life or something that has only developed recently?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think most people I see have a tendency to hang onto things, it has been there for like a long long time.\n",
      "So, starting more in like adolescence, but the switch getting flipped into like a real hoarding problem happens later, you know often it's like a gradual accumulation and then there could be some sort of life change that happens that makes things a lot worse or brings the problem up.\n",
      "Like if a person goes through a loss of a loved one, a spouse, a divorce, something like that, where if that other person had been sort of decluttering or keeping things at bay, and they're not there anymore then things can like take off a lot more.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, that's kind of my next question, is your sense of that progression that it is, for example, related to trauma or neurocognitive decline over the life course, or it it more social in the sense that people who are older tend to be isolated and also to have had more time to accumulate items, and perhaps inherit them from parents dying and things like that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think it's one of the second ones, I don't think it's necessarily like a neuro, I mean I'm not a brain scientist, but I don't think it's necessarily like a neurological degenerative disease.\n",
      "I think it's more that as your life goes on you get more stuff, and you gradually accumulate more and when people pass away, you also accumulate all their stuff.\n",
      "So, I think it's more probably social factors than biological ones.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, well I really appreciate your time, that's all the questions I have for you, we went through them pretty quickly so I'm glad that I can give you back some of your time, which you have so nicely dedicated to doing this research with us so thank you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, there’s a couple of the pieces I have are somewhat financially valuable.\n",
      "But um, actually the reason for keeping them is largely money that would be minted from putting it on a market is less important than the pleasure of hanging onto it.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:07): Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay, so, what do you think are the most important differences between what’s considered normal saving behavior, like collecting— like it sounds like you like to collect guitars and musical instruments— so, what do you think the difference is between what that is and what’s considered hoarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Hmm, probably the degree.\n",
      "If I’m actively using them, it seems like a worthwhile collection.\n",
      "If I front them and have them in the basement and haven’t touched them for 20 years it seems like, that seems like hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:55): Okay, that seems like kind of reminiscent of your own behavior.\n",
      "Are there things that, you know, you haven’t touched in 20 years?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:03): Alright.\n",
      "Is that the instruments, or anything else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It includes the instruments and equipment.\n",
      "It includes things that I was sure were gonna sometime be useful around the house and haven’t been actually utilized.\n",
      "Your bringing that up reminds me of the semi-successful, a purge of some items that were kept in the garage.\n",
      "We had eight or 10 magnificent fixtures that I was gonna be around using for the last 25 years and I haven’t.\n",
      "I finally loaded them into the van and got them off the premises.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:54): Okay.\n",
      "And did you feel better after you got rid of them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Surprisingly, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:59): Okay.\n",
      "So, I know we’ve talked a lot about the things you keep in your home and how that relates to clutter problems, but do you think there’s a way to tell if someone has problems with clutter without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Is there a way?\n",
      "Can you look at someone and say, “that person’s a hoarder”?\n",
      "Interviewer (38:22): Right.\n",
      "Like is there any tell.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I don’t know if there’s an equivalent to gate on for hoarders.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:42): You would say in general no?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not for sure.\n",
      "My sponsor’s a 75-year old clean, and you would just look at him and say he’s another old man.\n",
      "I’ve been pulled off enough by external appearances, I don’t know if I would give a lot of credence to that.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:10): Okay.\n",
      "Now, in that case, have you heard of any stereotypes of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Or have you seen any representations of hoarding disorder in the media that you agree with or disagree with?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, at least artistic tropes.\n",
      "You know, the old cat lady.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:38): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s what comes to mind.\n",
      "Probably there’s a similar one of old Boomers who’ve got too many guitars around and are clueless about how it looks to the outsider.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah because you don’t want to sugarcoat it.\n",
      "I mean you want to be realistic about it and it’s not a miracle cure.\n",
      "A lot of it is the therapist drawing you out or drawing your fears out to touch them without making you feel like you are on the burner.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: So I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Good!\n",
      "And so yeah this is shaping up nicely.\n",
      "What should be talked about in the videos and should there be specific questions asked and addressed in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: I would ask the counselors or the psychologists that one.\n",
      "I don’t… I don’t know.\n",
      "Um… questions again so if it’s a counselor talking with a child, I’m trying to picture it in my head when I close my eyes, so um you know friendly opening questions like “How was your day to day?” you know.\n",
      "Did you have any so for performance anxiety you know, “How did your test go?” Or “How did your presentation go?” You know ask things that um... are relative to what they are going through.\n",
      "If they are going to school ask then ask school related questions to sort of be the icebreakers.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Um if they are working, um…you know if you are talking about the adults being the patients um and not just the parents um… is that part of the scope or is it?\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s more so the perspective of the child as the patient but the parents are still involved.\n",
      "Speaker: Ok… so um you know if they have a lovey animal, you know a little lovey animal or a stuff animal that they bring with them you know, if it’s not too corny you can ask how the lovey is doing or the stuff animal so.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, and should they ask about how it worked for other kids?\n",
      "Speaker: How who should ask?\n",
      "Interviewer: Like should that a be like a question between maybe characters or should it be in the form of kind of a little snippet of an interview of kids explaining how its worked for them.\n",
      "Speaker: I’m not completely sure they know what method is being used on them and I’m not quite sure it’s necessary that they know.\n",
      "They just need something that works and helps them to uh navigate life better.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Do you think that there should be kids saying those things like its helped them, the feel better, and things of that sort?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: What about how exposures work?\n",
      "Speaker: Um I don’t think my daughter has done that.\n",
      "I don’t know… I don’t know how to answer that one.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Speaker: I guess exposure to me in my situation means that uh they… like my counselor is uh just incredibly good.\n",
      "If there is a day like I don’t feel like talking, she draws me out easily and she knows how to get me to talk.\n",
      "So for exposures she has me think of a memory and she has me put my… what’s the word, not my real finger, my um… psychological finger.\n",
      "I don’t know how to say that.\n",
      "So that to me the exposure is bringing old moods out into the open.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah and for some other kids the disorder may be putting them in a situation where they must face their fears or something that’s bothering them so do you think that would be beneficial to show in the video?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay so thank you so much for meeting with us today.\n",
      "Uh, I’m working with a team of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists on a project about cognitive behavioral therapy, uh, which is the type of therapy that he’s been receiving here at our clinic.\n",
      "Um, for this project, we want to develop a few, short educational videos about cognitive behavioral therapy um for children and their parents that are coming in to receive it.\n",
      "Um, and since cognitive behavioral therapy is a mouthful, we’ll be referring to it as CBT from now on.\n",
      "Speaker: Gotcha\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Um, so to start, please tell me what comes to mind when you think about CBT.\n",
      "Interview 014\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, well that’s the last list that I want you to make for me and I appreciate you doing that.\n",
      "The idea behind that is to compare the lists that are generated by different kinds of clinicians and then also compare those lists to those generated by patients to similar prompts to see if there are major areas of disconnect.\n",
      "So now I’d like to move into the more qualitative part of the interview and just to start that off if you wouldn’t mind just briefly giving me a little bit of an overview of your background related to hoarding disorder, how you encounter patients with this disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: I have been working with people with hoarding disorder and doing research on hoarding disorder for about twenty years, probably started in the late ‘90s actually.\n",
      "I’ve been working with them and patients and doing research on hoarding pretty consistently since that time.\n",
      "So in that twenty-year span I’ve seen a pretty large number of people with hoarding symptoms, with the actual hoarding disorder, and have delved into their phenomenology, their cognitive (INAUDIBLE, 14:24), their response to various treatments, behavioral therapies, cognitive therapies, as well as medication treatments, their structural and functional brain abnormalities in our brain imaging studies, their personality traits with associated features, all that stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you see patients clinically?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: And you hold a PhD in which field?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, MD.\n",
      "Interviewer: Oh, you’re an MD.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I’m a psychiatrist.\n",
      "Interviewer: Maybe?\n",
      "Speaker: I’m kind of a big kid so it doesn’t really, I don’t count.\n",
      "I don’t know I don’t relate to the adults [laughter].\n",
      "Interviewer: What would your preference be would it be to be animated or live action?\n",
      "Speaker: I just want it to be funny.\n",
      "Interviewer: You just want it to be funny?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Lighthearted because it’s really stressful.\n",
      "43:19: Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Speaker: It’s really stressful to be worried about someone else and even yourself and realize like you know there’s work to be done I’ve got to make some decisions so I’d rather it be informative, fast, and sort of upbeat and lighthearted because everything’s stressed anyway so um yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "I think that those are some really good key words like informative, fast…\n",
      "Speaker: Don’t want it to be too self-reflective…\n",
      "Interviewer: But adding some lightheartedness.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "I get that.\n",
      "Um so as far as what’s in the videos, again these characters, should we have any nonhuman characters?\n",
      "Speaker: Definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer: Definitely?\n",
      "Okay so animals?\n",
      "Speaker: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, what are some nonhuman characters maybe?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know I’m just really stuck on robots right now.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: I’m in a robot phase so I do a lot of robot stuff with my students and we talk about our brains all the time, we kiss our brains all the time, and we have a brain train.\n",
      "And we have train robbers that rob the brains and I make all kinds of silly little animations.\n",
      "So I was thinking sense my daughter’s OCD is named Mr. Waffles, I can totally play out a video in my head of Mr. Waffles trying to get on the train with her and then kicking him off.\n",
      "But that’s just what she chose to name her OCD.\n",
      "So…I don’t know, right now it feels like Looney Toons in my head so it would be a funny thing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so funny, Looney Toons, possibly animals, possibly some robots.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Not people.\n",
      "Interviewer: Not people?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know why.\n",
      "Interviewer: No that’s fair.\n",
      "Okay so should there be any superheroes?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, they would be their own superheroes.\n",
      "Interviewer: They’d be their own superheroes?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Everyone wants to be their own superhero.\n",
      "Interviewer: No yeah that’s fair.\n",
      "You know I understand that for sure.\n",
      "I think a lot of people definitely have the desire to be a superhero.\n",
      "Speaker: Well it’s harder for kids too because you gotta worry about, do they identify with that kid or are they the right ethnicity, is it a boy is it a girl, is it a whatever.\n",
      "And if it’s already a nonperson then they already like it and accept it and don’t compare themselves to it.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s a good point and that leads me to my next question; should we include children in the video and if so should it be a boy, girl or both?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "I don’t know.\n",
      "Could be Chris Pratt.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could be Chris Pratt.\n",
      "Speaker: Is it a boy is it a girl.\n",
      "We don’t know… I give them choices all the time with how they identify themselves or represent themselves you know and I’m always like surprised at what comes back and so given creative freedom you know often times it can be therapeutic to not be yourself sometimes.\n",
      "I don’t know that it would be relatable as relatable you know if you’re trying to, if you want a child to personally relate immediately then it might be more obvious if you made it people.\n",
      "But, maybe more entertaining and pay a little closer attention if it wasn’t people.\n",
      "Interviewer: Gotcha.\n",
      "So would we include parents, or friends or doctors or would those like kind of fit the non-people?\n",
      "speaker: I don’t know.\n",
      "Like at what point?\n",
      "Like if they were trying to decide if they were gonna, or inform them on what it is.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, they don't own— they have things that they own and, and right now it's in storage until they do finally settle.\n",
      "But they don't own any furniture, they have kept only the things that either had sentimental value or they knew they would be like, certain kitchen appliances, like their Instant Pot or whatever.\n",
      "They kept those things.\n",
      "And my oldest daughter is the same way.\n",
      "She, you know, she goes through on a pretty regular basis and colds the herd.\n",
      "Just gets rid of stuff that no longer has value to her.\n",
      "And, um, yeah.\n",
      "So, I think in that way it has affected them because they don't ever want to get to the point on that.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:35): Right.\n",
      "Okay, so how about outside of the family?\n",
      "Has it ever impacted work, other than you feeling like you needed to clean up the space because of working at home?\n",
      "Any time before quarantine where it's affected work?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, not that it affected work, no. Because, I mean, I have a desk in my bedroom and a writing table, and I have to work in there but… that affected my home life, it did not affect my work.\n",
      "[Inaudible; 48:08].\n",
      "Interviewer (48:16): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible.]\n",
      "Interviewer (49:00): Yeah, absolutely\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "I should just throw that crap away.\n",
      "Interviewer (49:24): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "And then when they’re not looking, toss it.\n",
      "Interviewer (49:35): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That is hard.\n",
      "Interviewer (49:37): Yeah.\n",
      "So, um, my last question for, you know, the interview is, if you were to wake up one day and all of the things that you consider cluttered in your household were just gone, and the things that were important were organized, how would you feel?\n",
      "Would you feel relieved or would you feel, you know, distress about the things being gone?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (50:01): Relieved.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (50:35): Oh good, I’m glad.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (50:55): Absolutely.\n",
      "Sometimes it can be easier if it's, you know, someone else and you're kind of removed from the situation.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "[Inaudible; (51:03)].\n",
      "…But I would not let somebody come into my house right now.\n",
      "Interviewer (51:38): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I mean, I don’t know how I would clean.\n",
      "I would be embarrassed.\n",
      "Interviewer (51:44): So, maybe that would be considered like a goal for you to have.\n",
      "You know, an organized house to the point that someone else could come in and help you out with that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (51:53): Okay.\n",
      "Alright, perfect.\n",
      "So that's going to be the end of the interview-like questions.\n",
      "And to wrap up, I just have some questions for like demographics, and then just a couple of questions so we can make sure we get your payment info correct.\n",
      "Alright, so, the first part is going to be your gender identity.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer (52:13): Okay.\n",
      "And that's the same as your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, you know, it'll go back to, it'll go back to yarn.\n",
      "I'll say that I'm going to make such and such.\n",
      "I have the perfect yarn to make such and such for my mother for her birthday.\n",
      "And, I know I’ve got the yarn, and I can see it, and I remember buying it.\n",
      "But I cannot find it anywhere.\n",
      "And it's because I stuck it in a tote bag and threw the tote bag in a corner.\n",
      "And I may come up with it six months later when I come across the tote bag.\n",
      "But then I have to go and either buy— I have to go buy more yarn, for this whatever I was going to make.\n",
      "And so yeah, I mean that that happens.\n",
      "Not so— like I said, since I've organized not so much anymore.\n",
      "But, but, yes, it definitely would stop me from doing something.\n",
      "Or I bought tickets to something and I can’t find the tickets.\n",
      "Because… I mean right now I can't find my wallet.\n",
      "I don't carry a wallet; I carry my driver's license and a credit card, um, in a phone case.\n",
      "But I have a wallet that has, you know, like some gift cards in it and things like that.\n",
      "Have no clue where it is.\n",
      "I've looked what I thought was everywhere that I could’ve put it, but I don't have any idea where it is.\n",
      "So, if I wanted to use those gift cards, I don't even know where they are.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:22): Right.\n",
      "So, it does get in the way of certain aspects of daily life then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:31): Okay.\n",
      "And, I know you were talking a little bit earlier with me about how it's upset your husband in the past, but I heard you mention that you had kids.\n",
      "Did it ever impact any sort of relationship with your kids, or any sort of situation?\n",
      "Maybe they wanted to have friends over and something like that, or no?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, not really.\n",
      "Um, it’s interesting because my oldest daughter, um, keeps it extremely clean.\n",
      "Now, she does have a tendency to, you know, get kind of messy.\n",
      "But she keeps a very neat apartment.\n",
      "And my youngest daughter— and both of them, you know, are minimalists.\n",
      "I mean my youngest daughter, literally right now, she and her partner are living in Airbnb’s one month at a time.\n",
      "Because right now it's cheaper than an apartment, and they don't know where they want to live.\n",
      "But they are literally living with their clothes in a suitcase.\n",
      "Interviewer (46:50): Wow, okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, in, in a storage building.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:49): Gotcha.\n",
      "And so, now you have your own space from what I understand.\n",
      "So, have those things since been removed from the storage?\n",
      "Do you have a storage unit anymore?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yes I do.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:03): Okay, so what kinds of things do you keep in your storage?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well um, right now, right now my storage is half used by my sister because she used to collect M&Ms and now she's on this beat., um, I want to get rid of every single one of them.\n",
      "So, she's probably got about ten boxes of um, M&M stuff in there.\n",
      "I have— oh, I love these, which I don’t buy these for Christmas because I have the houses, you know?\n",
      "Like um, uh, a mansion, different things like that.\n",
      "I never really looked into finding the ones that were like, businesses, like the bakery, the toy house.\n",
      "I have the little cottages, things like that.\n",
      "So, uh, I have a lot of that.\n",
      "Nut that’s all in storage because I have nowhere else to put it.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:51): So, Christmas decorations and that sort of thing?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Christmas-y stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:55): Okay, so, in terms of the things that, you know, you have in your storage and that you have in your house, what would happen if, you know one day you were to wake up and all of it was gone?\n",
      "Would you be relieved, or would you be, you know, upset and frustrated about it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, you know what, I, I pray to God about that.\n",
      "I know that none of this is worth a thing.\n",
      "But it costs a lot, I know that.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:21): Right.\n",
      "So, you know in the, in the case where you might lose it or anything like that, you would kind of just accept that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I would but I would probably go back out and buy some of the stuff I lost.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:35): Right, right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:39): Okay, so, now we're going to talk a little bit about, you know, hoarding disorder in general.\n",
      "So, in your opinion, what do you think are important differences between what you might consider like normal collecting and like normal, like saving and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay, um… Well, it’s having things that you don't need, and you have to pay for.\n",
      "And uh, just, not being able to get rid of them or want to ever.\n",
      "Because I, I really try to curb myself a lot— I really, really have.\n",
      "Like, you know, um, uh, buying something that I don't need, because I also like clothes.\n",
      "But I’ve, I’ve got it pretty under control.\n",
      "I’m doing pretty good on that.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:38): Okay.\n",
      "So, you know, when you think of hoarding disorder, whatever image you picture in your mind, would you say it's, you know, similar or maybe different from your own behavior?\n",
      "Interviewer: So that brings us nicely into the next section of the interview which focuses on the question of insight.\n",
      "And so, as we’ve talked about a lot of the literature surrounding hoarding disorder describes many hoarding patients as having low insight, and so the first question to start out with is how would you as a clinician define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean think that I often times define it in impairment as well.\n",
      "It’s like, are they able to recognize the level of impairment that is coming from behaviors that they’re currently engaging in?\n",
      "And if they’re not able to—let’s say it’s causing significant conflict with a spouse, they are pretty much sleeping on the floor somewhere randomly in their home and they have to wash their face at work or something like that, brush their teeth, then I would say not understanding or recognizing that these behaviors are to some degree not normal is how I kind of think about the patient’s ability to understand he repercussions of what’s happening or how it’s affecting their everyday lives.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhm, so like acknowledgement of distress.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: For the patients that you’ve seen, how much insight do they tend to have by the time they get to you?\n",
      "What level of insight do you think that most levels of patients that you’ve seen are?\n",
      "Interviewee: Let me think of some of the patients that I remember treating.\n",
      "I can think about five patients off hand and I’ve only remember one out of the five actually having poor insight.\n",
      "The others all had I think really high insight into their problems.\n",
      "Interviewer: And in your experience with the patients that you’ve seen, do you have any knowledge of how they came to gain that insight on their own or what the process was of them realizing their disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: For most of them it became impairment.\n",
      "So one lady, she had hoarded her home literally to the brim and was living in an extended stay hotel for over a year, and he was getting herself into a lot of financial difficulty because she had a monthly payment on a home she could not live in, she was paying for a hotel every single night, she had started to hoard the hotel room to the brim, and they had to obviously come and check on the room from time to time and she had been cited by them, I think, for being a fire hazard in the room.\n",
      "So, she was able to come to the conclusion for herself, “this is a problem, I need help”.\n",
      "The other lady had a conflict with her husband who was an artist, and she was having some conflict with him about the finances and the status of their home given her excessive shopping and inability to get rid of things.\n",
      "Another patient had a similar financial problem, she owned like three homes and financially was in a lot of difficulty because she had owned the homes originally to rent it out as rental properties, but then started using them as a place to store her items that she was hoarding and was not able to afford the mortgages on them without having this supplemental income.\n",
      "So, she also was kind of at the tipping point for knowing that it was an issue and needing to seek help.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "So for, as a parent, what was your involvement in CBT?\n",
      "As far as the therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: So, I’ve always tried to give the option of letting my child just own it and go without me which is not how I normally parent.\n",
      "We’re very involved in each other’s lives but I was like if you need to be away from me, okay.\n",
      "I will accept it, you know.\n",
      "Who knows, maybe it’s me, you know, that is triggering a bunch of things.\n",
      "So, kind of, letting a little person makes some, what feels like, big decisions is interesting.\n",
      "Of course, as a parent, it is a lot of you have to think about the expense just the logistics of making it all happen.\n",
      "Then, so far we have had everybody it’s always very welcome and inclusive and saying you can come in, you know, you can be a part or role in any way that you want.\n",
      "I’ve always checked with my daughter every and anytime and say okay do you want me to stay out or if you need me to come in.\n",
      "Whatever you want, everyone always seems very flexible about making it work out however it needs to be.\n",
      "In our case there were times where I’d have to sort of nudge and be like okay I think you should.\n",
      "Have you worked on, have you done your homework yet for that?\n",
      "The regular parenting- the regular parenting things or just recognizing, you know, we would come up with code words or whatever to kind of help when they’re out and about in the world.\n",
      "Kind of see that going on, and she’s even had that before with me and she’ll be texting me code words when she’s in a social situation so that I’m just kind of alert.\n",
      "Okay, she’s feeling the anxiety rising, and usually we have made some plans ahead of time like what that would be and it’s never like abort it’s usually like support and I’ll be here to love you while this goes on but this is- we’re in it kind of together type thing and it’s always worked out way better.\n",
      "We rarely ever need the plans but just having, I think, that feeling of support that’s just- in whatever form it has needed to be but I feel like that’s just kind of parenting in general.\n",
      "So I don’t know that’s just parenting with CBT would be normal parenting.\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s useful for us to know.\n",
      "I mean, that’s your experience.\n",
      "Speaker: But I guess everybody parents different, I don’t know so.\n",
      "Interviewer: And you mentioned kind of your experience and you mentioned like some of the things that you kind of have to know before you get into it are the logistics and the expense.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Is there anything else that would be useful for other parents to know before they kind of have their child jump into this?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know anything else, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s fine, yeah.\n",
      "Okay, so the next several or few questions, I guess, is going to be kind of… geared at kind of how you-where you’ve heard about CBT outside of the clinic and outside of [32:16]\n",
      ".\n",
      "So the first one is kind of about movies, TV, internet, and other people.\n",
      "So how much did you know about CBT from these other things?\n",
      "Speaker: Nothing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Nothing?\n",
      "Okay… Did you ever- or have you ever read or heard any scientific research about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: No?\n",
      "Is that something, you know, if we did these videos or as we are thinking about these videos would that be something that would be useful to be talked about in the videos?\n",
      "Or do you think it wouldn’t really be-have an effect.\n",
      "Speaker: I mean I feel like everybody loves a bullet point, you know like a statistic any sort of research based quick- if it’s quick.\n",
      "Interviewer: So quick research base like bullet points, statistics\n",
      "Speaker: Statistics, yeah like a statistic.\n",
      "Whatever, anything that has to do with it.\n",
      "Success rates, I don’t know, how many- I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: So let kids know that there’s nothing wrong with them?\n",
      "Speaker: That it’s okay, yes.\n",
      "Because some kids are like, “Oh, if my friends find out that I’m seeking therapy that must mean something’s wrong with me.”\n",
      "That cognitively.\n",
      "I don’t want to use the word disabled, but something’s wrong.\n",
      "So make it like, “No, it’s normal.”\n",
      "As I said, the name CBT, cognitive, some people might say, “Okay, that means that you or your kid have some mental problem.”\n",
      "So it has to be made like, yes, it’s a big word but that doesn’t mean it’s something where you feel like you have to be labeled for doing the therapy.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, is there anything I missed?\n",
      "Anything else you would like to talk about?\n",
      "Speaker: So these videos, will be available where?\n",
      "At the school level?\n",
      "Interviewer: Mostly for right now, we’re thinking it’s for patients or parents that are considering going into therapy, but we have heard that we should make it available to schools so that kids know that the option is available to them.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "I think that would be great because for people who are coming here, they have already taken the step, so it’s going to help them to continue.\n",
      "But I think it would be very helpful if it’s being shown at the school because like I’ve said, for me, I felt like I neglected, and I felt like, “Oh no, this is simply because my kid needs to work harder,” but after I brought my daughter and I saw what’s possible, I saw the benefit of it, I was like, “Okay, I want to do it for my son too.\n",
      "[41:53-41:55] ___ Oh no, he’s going to be labeled, because there is this, especially with international people, this stigma of, “Oh, you’re going to therapy?\n",
      "Something must be wrong.”\n",
      "So I think if this is available at the school or even if the school let parents know that these videos are available, and if they want to, they can access it.\n",
      "Then parents can look at it if they feel like, “Okay, maybe I want to give it a try.”\n",
      "Because I think you would see the benefit of it for people who don’t know about your program.\n",
      "And I think the best place is school- that’s where parents get their information most of the time.\n",
      "Interviewer: So just make it more accessible so that more people are educated and not scared of it?\n",
      "Speaker: Exactly, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, is there anything else?\n",
      "Speaker: No, I think that’s it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time.\n",
      "Speaker: Of course.\n",
      "Interviewer: Alright so thanks for meeting with us today.\n",
      "We already kind of went through a lot of what the study is about.\n",
      "To just kind of reiterate, we are going to talk about cognitive behavioral therapy so really just the therapy that we are going here at the clinic.\n",
      "So you may have some experience with other types of therapy, we’re going to try to focus on this type of therapy here.\n",
      "Ideally we’ll use this to create some videos.\n",
      "We haven’t quite decided yet if it will be more geared towards children and parents or if we’re going to do two separate videos.\n",
      "So that’s some questions you might have different thoughts on based off of either.\n",
      "Speaker: Do you include the FEAR facers camp?\n",
      "Is that a part of the clinic from here?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes, you can include stuff from FEAR facers.\n",
      "Speaker: Because that was very awesome.\n",
      "Interviewer: I’m a big fan of FEAR facers, so yeah.\n",
      "That would be fine for this as well.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "17:49 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay so organization and just being able to find things, that's more of a collector, but a hoarder has less organization and it's more disordered, of course.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, and I suppose the value of the object itself.\n",
      "You know how easily you could replace it or get the information, like thinking of the brothers in New York that had all those newspapers in their house.\n",
      "You know, if you needed to find a newspaper article you could get it from the library or something.\n",
      "You don't need to keep all these decades worth of newspapers in your apartment.\n",
      "So, you know...\n",
      "18:33 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and what does hoarding disorder look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It looks like a house that you can't walk from one room to the next.\n",
      "And it looks like bottle caps and aluminum foil and insect and rodent infestations and objects that have no intrinsic value to 99% of the population.\n",
      "If someone keeps that kind of stuff, then I think they’re disordered.\n",
      "19:11 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and based on your description, how is that the same or different from your own behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I keep a lot of stuff, that I have no use for, but I think at some point I might want to look at it.\n",
      "I might want that association or, more importantly, I think sometimes there's stuff mixed in with... like a letter that might trigger me might be mixed in with a bunch of old bills or third class mail or something like that, that I just don't want to touch it or look at it, to sort through it because I think it would be triggering or upsetting to me.\n",
      "So I'll just keep the whole thing instead, the whole mess and stick it in a drawer or plastic bag and then put the plastic bag in the closet and then take it out of the closet, put it in a box, and put it in the attic or something like that.\n",
      "20:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so for you, your problems with clutter is it's less like obstructive in your house, but you definitely put things away, but it’s less organized.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "20:42 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I guess it would be if someone was [21:00] INCOHERENT and then they told you, but no. I don’t know.\n",
      "21:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "So you don’t think so?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably not.\n",
      "21:12 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay and where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah. Ultimately I feel like she’s in control of it.\n",
      "It’s not like you have to do this at any time if you change your mind, you know.\n",
      "And I think as a child that was probably helpful for her because you tend to be told you’re going to listen to the adults and you’re going to, you know.\n",
      "At least that’s how we roll but I think her realizing, you know, this is making me way more [20:08]\n",
      "being able to vocalize and say never mind not ready for that or you know this is how I am feeling and always being able to give that feedback and it’s always been adjusted immediately and not oh okay well were done but like okay we’ll back it down we’re still going to keep working like this, you know.\n",
      "I don’t know\n",
      "Interviewer: She still has some control.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah she’s felt like she’s had some control of it I think so that’s helped her feel like she can still make progress without having to completely submit to everyone.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "You talked about- you mentioned how you didn’t realize that OCD can be this thought labor-\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah this really internal.\n",
      "I didn’t realize- yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: It sounds like similarly anxiety you mentioned kind of this thought spiral.\n",
      "So you mentioned, you know, how that kind of becomes a problem in someone’s life.\n",
      "If someone- in terms of anxiety and OCD, and this may be similar to your own experiences but what would be important for other patients to know?\n",
      "So like not necessarily about the therapy itself but about the anxiety that we are trying to treat with CBT?\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Speaker: I think so, well from what I have seen it almost they like remedies almost even.\n",
      "So sometimes it’s like having the anxiety about the OCD or… obsessing about… yeah obsessing about something that’s making you anxious.\n",
      "It’s almost like sometimes it can be… because I’ve tried to separate them because I know you can, you know, just have one and not the other and I’m trying to separate them but it seems like there’s a dance that there is happening often times and… really I think that the CBD or CBT is applicable to both situations.\n",
      "So it’s win/win no matter what if it’s something that tends to be that, well I guess they kind of both are well I don’t know at least I’m not experienced that’s kind of what it’s been, she gets stuck in a cycle and then it’s just complete breaks are on, everything is stopping and she can’t break herself free from it without these different tools that she’s finally got.\n",
      "Just recognizing and realizing what she can sense things right away like my heart rate is picking up and she has tools that she can use that she can do anywhere anytime and if that’s… if it continues to elevate and she feels that going on then she has sort of these checks and balances that she can use.\n",
      "If it ever gets to the point where she feels like she can’t manage it of course then we usually just come to session to [23:56]\n",
      "out whatever is going on and adjusting it a little bit.\n",
      "That’s kind of been her attempt but her solution our solution…\n",
      "Interviewer: So you mentioned, oh sorry were you?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: So rather than trying to force it on them, you get them to kind of say it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, versus getting them to understand what are some of the benefits of changing the behavior?\n",
      "What are some of the cons of changing this behavior?\n",
      "What are some of the benefits of not changing?\n",
      "What are some of the cons of not changing?\n",
      "So just really like changing that approach to getting them to elicit some of the reasons why change might be helpful or might create less stress for them and working with them there.\n",
      "The other thing that I typically do is try to get them to think about, you know, it’s reasonable to want to save things, it’s reasonable to think that you may be able to use them again in the future if it’s sentimental or that kind of thing, but also getting them to think about are these things that are really easy for you to get rid of that you’re just not getting rid of right now?\n",
      "And so, kind of getting them to start on the smaller scale and working their way up.\n",
      "Interviewer: One thing that we wanted to talk about, and I’m getting towards the end of the time that we have today so I want to make sure to get these last couple of questions in, when you talk to patients with hoarding problems, what—and this might be a difficult question for you to answer to feel free to tell me—when you talk to patients with hoarding problems, what ideas do they have about what’s caused them to have these problems?\n",
      "What do they think?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s actually a great question, I’ve actually talked with the people that I’ve worked with a lot.\n",
      "So, one of the ladies that comes to mind, I was working at her home disability [INAUDIBLE 40:16] and she was staying in the extended stay.\n",
      "We worked on her home for over a year and we would spend a lot of time while we sorting and organizing trying to do decluttering exercises and talking about what caused it.\n",
      "She really linked it to a rape that had happened to her in her late teen kind of early adulthood period, as well as a number or string of stressful life events that occurred relative to a decade of time and she actually had become morbidly obese as well and she basically said that, “no one would break into my home or try to hurt me if I am obese and if they can’t really get into my home.”\n",
      "Interviewer: So, in the literature there’s been a breakdown of the concept of insight into kind of different constructs, and I’ll just read you the construct and I’d like to talk through with you if you think that these are good constructs, if you see some of them more than others, if you think that some of them are more salient at different times or different patients.\n",
      "So, one of them is defensiveness, one of them is anosognosia—total inability to perceive an illness or that something is wrong or causing a distress or reducing the quality of your life; one is overvalued ideation, the actual belief in the potential value of items, so more of a delusion sort of thing; one is indifference.\n",
      "I’ll go through the list again if that would be helpful.\n",
      "Interviewee: That would be.\n",
      "Interviewer: Defensiveness, so feeling the need to defend your behavior as a problem with insight; anosognosia, so not seeing it as an illness; overvalued ideation, or believing that, actually being more of a delusion that items are actually more valuable than they are; or being indifferent.\n",
      "So, in your experience, which of these insight-related issues is the most salient for patients with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Which is the most important for you with patients with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a good question, I’ve definitely seen the first three in patients.\n",
      "I haven’t as much seen the last one but definitely the first three.\n",
      "Overvalued ideation is definitely something that comes up, I don’t know that I ever think about it in a delusion kind of sense because I think it’s not uncommon to have some sort of an attachment to an item that maybe someone close to you gave you, but maybe, like I said, it’s more or less the number of items they apply that same concept to.\n",
      "So, it’s like the concept itself isn’t bad but it’s just the way in which they apply it is almost like overkill.\n",
      "And then I’ve definitely seen a defensive style thinking about a patient who really didn’t think she had a problem got very defensive and it was causing these issues with her daughter, felt like it was her daughter’s problem not hers, and really at all didn’t not see her behavior as an illness or problematic despite the fact that she was living in pretty severe squalor as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you try to approach a patient who has low insight, what are some of the ways in which you help a patient to gain insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I guess sometimes I try to do, in my approach, kind of like alongside of reflecting back like you don’t see this as a problem so you can’t think of ways in which this isn’t the best for you.\n",
      "So, trying to get them to illicit that kind of change talk in how maybe it is impacting them.\n",
      "Also getting at like, “so what do you think are some of the reasons that this is causing a problem for yourself?” It’s just getting them to come up with these things on their own because they’re always told it’s a problem and that it’s wrong, but it’s not a conversation.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:26): Right.\n",
      "So, what does your hoarding look like?\n",
      "So, in your space in your, you know, bedrooms in your house or—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:36): What does that look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, um, uh, I don’t remember too good right now.\n",
      "Um, let me see… oh gosh… okay, let me—\n",
      "Interviewer (12:50): No worries.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, um, I’m talking to somebody [inaudible; (12:56)].\n",
      "Okay, alright.\n",
      "Can you give that question again?\n",
      "Interviewer (12:59): Right.\n",
      "So, you were talking earlier about how, you know, you couldn't really bring stuff into the house with your second husband.\n",
      "But now that you can, what does your space look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, my bedroom’s a wreck.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:16): Okay, so, what do you mean by wreck?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I’ve got, um, I’ve got stuff everywhere.\n",
      "I have wrapped up my, my um, my bed has not been cleared.\n",
      "I sleep on one side.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:33): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And, uh, yeah, I would like to have a bed.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:39): So, what are you keeping on your bed that's preventing you from sleeping on the other side?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh my god.\n",
      "Uh, [inaudible; (13:36)].\n",
      "Sometimes I put things, you know, to put them into a container, so I can find somewhere to put that.\n",
      "Um, it’s, it's just all kinds of different things.\n",
      "What mainly stays on my bed is, um, I always have my Bible with me.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:02): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s always on my bed.\n",
      "That’s, that’s my supportive thing.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:07): Right.\n",
      "So, the other things are just kind of, you know, uh, random things that need to be sorted?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:15): Okay, so, there's no particular thing that you tend to hoard more than others, like papers or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Umm… um, I have a huge, uh, selection of cups and saucers.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:30): Of what was that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Cups and saucers.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:32): Cups and saucers, gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "And right now, I have so many that I have to, uh, put them in the uh, um, the storage room, right?\n",
      "In my laundry room I have a big place of bins around.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:45): Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, that I have managed to control.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:49): Okay.\n",
      "So, other than your bedroom, do you hoard in any other parts of the house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, uh, you see, I say in… probably the kitchen.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:05): Okay.\n",
      "And what does that look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s uh, where I keep, well… Um, I have a lot of things in the pantry that are for putting things in the pantry.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:16): Okay.\n",
      "So, things like dishes or Tupperware, or things like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I have, um, wooden spoons.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:27): Wooden spoons, gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:32): Okay.\n",
      "So, when you go about collecting these things that end up, you know, um… that you end up hoarding, where do you get these things?\n",
      "And why do you purchase them?\n",
      "Interviewer: Is your sense that people are actually afraid of losing the memory and forgetting if they get rid of the item?\n",
      "Like they think that the memory will be gone and they will forget the memory or is it--?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I think that they definitely think that and as a part of my master’s thesis I actually did a memory [INAUDIBLE 47:57] and hoarders actually have really great memories, and that’s been another interesting finding in the literature, that the memory deficits are all perceived, they’re not actually there.\n",
      "But there is this fear of forgetting or not remembering something.\n",
      "Interviewer: That is so interesting.\n",
      "I don’t think that’s ever come up in an interview before but that is, I think that brings very true...it’s something that nobody else has picked up on and something that I’d like to talk to you about.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, it’s definitely fascinating.\n",
      "I did a verbal [INAUDIBLE 48:26] test where there were asked to recite items and even like a 20-minute delay when I go back and reassess these 20 items that they’re told to remember, and it was fascinating to see time and time again hoarders—because that’s who I recruited for my thesis—just like remember every single item I had said.\n",
      "But it also makes sense to me because they can remember where an item is in their home even if it’s buried among like, I mean I can barely find my keys and my home is really organized, and they can tell you where this random sheet of paper is.\n",
      "Interviewer: But for you and your experience with these patients at the same time they have kind of a fear of losing memories.\n",
      "Do you feel like, so we talked a little bit about this inappropriate valuation kind of inability to distinguish between things that are valuable and things that are less valuable, do you think that that extends to memories as well?\n",
      "That they have trouble distinguishing between things that that should be remembered and things that are able to be forgotten?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, yeah, I don’t think I’ve ever thought about that but yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting, that was really interesting, I unfortunately am at the end of my time with you today, but I would love to continue this conversation.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "38:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Your race?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "38:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ethnicity- do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "38:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and your general household income?\n",
      "You can give me a range if you'd like.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Maybe 60 to 70 thousand.\n",
      "38:27 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and your geographic region?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "We’re in Kentucky.\n",
      "38:35 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so I think that's about the south or the Midwest.\n",
      "I'm not sure, but okay.\n",
      "And your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Graduate school.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer (31:17): So, um, financial value is important but not the most important thing?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:22): Okay.\n",
      "When we were talking about your items that are the most precious, would you say it's mostly because of its use to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, but also because it was very, um, intentionally selected.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:47): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, you know, I, I, you know, I went to Ireland, and I bought, you know, this skein of yarn.\n",
      "And I went to Northern California, and I bought that skein of yarn.\n",
      "And, and every year when I go to Florida, I buy, you know, I go to this little shop and I always buy from particular dire.\n",
      "I mean, those, those skeins of yarn each, for the most part, each have significance to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:24): So, they have sentimental value in those.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:25): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Some of it, some of it has been, some of it was gifted to me.\n",
      "Some of it, um, friends had spun or dyed and given it to me.\n",
      "Now yes, it does have its use, and knitting is probably the thing that keeps me from killing people on a lot of days.\n",
      "But um, but yes.\n",
      "And honestly, this has come from, just like clearing out that room during this quarantine.\n",
      "That I was able to take like a huge bin of the yarns that I wasn't in love with, that had no value to me.\n",
      "and give them to people who would appreciate them.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:09): Okay, good.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And I, and I did that.\n",
      "That was, that was sort of my— it was, it was hard.\n",
      "But it was, it was one of those things where okay, I'm done.\n",
      "Now what I have left— which is, I mean, you would be horrified.\n",
      "But most people who, who, you know, participate in these, these arts, you know, this is pretty standard— is to have these bins full of yarns.\n",
      "Um… you know, but everything in there now that I can go in and I can say ooh I love that one, let me make a sweater, or let me make somebody's birthday present from this, or whatever.\n",
      "And not digging through going where’s the good stuff?\n",
      "Because right now it's all good stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:57): So, if you had to choose between your items, in this case maybe like a few yarns that you have, how would you choose between them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "As to what I gave away?\n",
      "Interviewer (34:11): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… I guess I would choose between them based on, you know, when I, when I look at it, when I hold it, when I feel it, does it make me happy?\n",
      "Interviewer (34:32): Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you have any sense for the patients you see clinically of that process of how they got to your office, or of what started them down the road of seeking treatment if it was, if it's primarily social family members or if there's kind of like a commonality if they decide to come see you?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, no , it's a range of different things, like some people have come to see me because of themselves, because this has been a problem or something that I've wanted to work on for a long time and for whatever reason now is the time.\n",
      "But other people have come to see me because they're under threat of divorce, because someone is telling them that they need to do this.. this or me, type of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so for kind of a conclusion of this interview I have some more speculative questions and I find that some people enjoy the process of speculation more than others, so if these sound like nonsense questions to you, that's fine.\n",
      "The first one is, we talked earlier in the interview about the reasons that people give for saving, the reasons that they give for keeping things like, \"This might be useful later\" or \"I'm worried that I'll need this,\" and when you think about hoarding as a disorder, do you think that these things are kind of driving the behavior?\n",
      "So, they're really thinking, \"I might need this\" so they're saving it, or do you see hoarding as a behavior driven disorder in the sense of they have some underlying pathology that has caused them to want to save things, and then later after they've done the behavior, they've come up with a justification for that behavior sort of post-hoc?\n",
      "Do you have any sense for that process or any kind of.. I know that that's maybe not a testable question, but I guess I'm asking you to speculate about how that works.\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, that's a good question.\n",
      "If I had to guess, I would say that when people are acquiring an item they have the thought, \"Oh, this is nice,\" or \"Oh, I could use this\" and then they just save it.\n",
      "And I don't necessarily know if they like intend to save it forever when they get it, but once something is yours, you kind of feel like you own it and then it hurts you to part with it.\n",
      "So, I think it probably starts with the acquiring and the thoughts that the person has during the acquiring, and hen they're, you know they have a reason that they've got it and that's probably also the reason that they're saving it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, so something about the process of, like at the root of this disorder, something about the process of ownership or of making an object yours is what's driving this and that is the ... the thought behind it is really what's driving the disorder.\n",
      "So, they really are believing in the moment that whatever it is is gonna be useful or is gonna be valuable, and then once they've got it they can't kind of part with that reason.\n",
      "I don't know if that seems like a fair synopsis of what you just said.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "I mean [INAUDIBLE 32:27] that sounds like a good mechanism is plausible.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Our visit was brief.\n",
      "Um, I was not entirely ready to address the project, and so I stepped away from it.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:00): Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay, so, now I’m going to talk a little bit about any conflict you might have had with family members, or friends, or landlords.\n",
      "Has there ever been any conflict in your life that kind of resulted because of your problems with clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "One with the landlord, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:24): Okay, can you tell me about that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The place I’m in right now was being renovated and I was given the opportunity to move space.\n",
      "Well, the work was done in this space.\n",
      "And, I, uh, I didn’t move all of my materials out of this space and it was brought to my attention by the building manager.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:02): Okay.\n",
      "And, how was that brought to your attention?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "If the things are here another day it’s gonna be gone.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:11): Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay, so, other than the landlord, have you ever had any conflicts with your family members about it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "A loving niece kindly brought it to my attention that she’s noticed that our residence has uh, has a jumbled appearance.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:35): Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And, would I like any help?\n",
      "Interviewer (15:40): Okay, so she’s personally offered you help with that then.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:45): Alright, and I noticed you said “our” space.\n",
      "Do you live alone, or do you live with somebody else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have a wife of about 30 years of marriage and 39 years of together.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:58): Okay.\n",
      "So, has your wife ever taken issue with your problems with your problems with clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, we have, uh… a similar, a similar challenge with, um, storing and not disposing.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:25): Gotcha.\n",
      "So, between you and your wife, would you say that your problems are worse, or are they slightly better?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That may be a matter of perspective.\n",
      "I am one who is, um, attempting to take some steps on it.\n",
      "My wife may be attempting to make attempting to make steps on it, but she is not getting any help.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:57): Right.\n",
      "Okay, so, if you could describe your home for me.\n",
      "What does your home look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Like a huge jumble.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:08): Okay.\n",
      "Can you emphasize a little bit?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "We live in an area that is um, was at one point in the city’s history past the city’s limits.\n",
      "So, it’s not an entirely urban area.\n",
      "The external area is delightfully wild.\n",
      "We have racoons, moles, lots of birds, beavers.\n",
      "All manner of wildlife outside in a rather wild-looking yard space.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:46): Okay, and how does the clutter look like in the home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "In the home, it’s apparent at the entryway, where there are more jackets than we can wear.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:01): Okay, and are they hung up on the walls, or in piles?\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so now we’re going to kind of move into the section of the interview that talks about how to know hoarding behavior and what distinguishes hoarding as a disorder.\n",
      "So one of the things we’re interested in is the line between hoarding as a disorder and normal saving behavior or saving behavior that’s on the normal spectrum.\n",
      "So in your mind, what are the most important differences between normal saving behaviors such as perhaps collecting or even extreme collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: If I had to name one thing I would say it’s the impairment that it causes.\n",
      "I obviously think that that’s the nearest—there’s a very thin line between what we consider something that meets for this clinical and diagnostic criteria that we have and what doesn’t, and to me the kind of thing that I’m constantly looking for when I’m seeing symptoms of someone on the spectrum, which I think that most things are, is the impairment and is it really interfering with aspects of daily kind of functioning like social relationships, employment, occupational relationships, and tasks, and just kind of an overall a [INAUDIBLE 10:20] and living.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how do you distinguish impairment from just kind of like impact?\n",
      "What sorts of things do you look for when you look for something that is really impairing?\n",
      "I guess that’s maybe a tricky question but what I’m trying to get at is people change their lives and things have an impact on their lives, but what for you is really the line that pushes something like that into something that is an impairment?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a good question.\n",
      "I mean, I like for it to be something that the patient thinks is impairing, not something that necessarily a clinician or I am telling them that is impairing, although with hoarding that can be sometimes trickier given that sometimes patients aren’t coming necessarily on their own accord.\n",
      "So, I guess the things that I’m looking for are, “is it causing substantial conflict?”, not that it’s just impacting the relationship but that it’s causing substantial conflict or something like that in their relationship maybe with someone that is living in the home.\n",
      "Maybe their safety is at risk or the safety of others is at risk.\n",
      "Maybe financially they’re not able anymore to afford having multiple storage units or places to put their things.\n",
      "Maybe they don’t live in their home anymore and that’s becoming sort of a difficulty having to afford living in a hotel as well as having a home that you can’t use for its intended purposes.\n",
      "But I don’t have a great answer for that because that is tough.\n",
      "051\n",
      "Interviewer (0:00): Okay, so before we get started, I just wanted to ask you what term you prefer when we're discussing issues with clutter or hoarding, if there is a term you prefer.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:13): Okay, so that's going to conclude the first little part of our interview.\n",
      "The second part is going to be more like a casual conversation, where we're just going to, you know, talk a little bit about your particular experience, and everything like that.\n",
      "So, I’m going to start off by asking you to describe your clutter problems.\n",
      "How long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible.]\n",
      "Interviewer (6:39): Right.\n",
      "So—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, obviously, you know, as far back as, you know, not being able to keep my room tidy as a child.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:51): Okay.\n",
      "So, when you were a child, what did that look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Clothes on the floor, toys not put up.\n",
      "Um, some of my earliest memories though are, you know, my, my father, who, you know, would have a stack of things on a table next to him.\n",
      "It wasn't exactly the, the modeling that, you know, I mean, I, I kind of feel like I know where I learned it from.\n",
      "Um, you know, the garage that was always overflowing, and, um, you know the table that always had a ton of books on it or whatever.\n",
      "Um, it just wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't very— the home wasn't very tidy.\n",
      "Um, but then I wasn't either so.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:48): So, you witnessed a lot of similar behavior in your father then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:52): Gotcha.\n",
      "And so, I know you said that he kind of kept like a cluttered garage, and things on like his nightstand.\n",
      "Um, but can you kind of go into a little bit more detail about what his clutter looked like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It was just, it was just, you know, a mishmash.\n",
      "A pile of, you know, books and papers and, um, things like— I guess the best way to describe it would be, my husband was raised in a place that everything had its place.\n",
      "I mean, that was, my father-in-law was very much like that.\n",
      "And in my house, nothing had a place.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:43): Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It was, it was wherever you put it.\n",
      "That was the place.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:48): Alright.\n",
      "And now in your adult life, how severe would you say that your own behavior is?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It's pretty, it's pretty bad.\n",
      "Um, you know, I have, I have recurring fantasies of, you know, being a genie.\n",
      "Being able to blink my eyes and just have my space clean.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:12): Right.\n",
      "Speaker: Well one I just wished I would have realized was I remember when we were talking about which kind of path to take I really had no idea and not that-maybe there is not guarantee but like how quickly it could be if it was intensive because looking back, I mean, it took us many months to get through something that was affecting her on a daily basis.\n",
      "So looking back, it may have been worth to just take a week off of school and just focus on this and then working back to catch up to get through school.\n",
      "And/or it worked out with the Fear Facers, it was a camp that was available also during a break so, you know, if you can’t- if it wouldn’t work in a schedule just knowing that okay maybe it doesn’t have to be right now but… maybe into the future a little bit we could do these three days right here or, you know, like that kind of thing.\n",
      "It didn’t even have- it didn’t occur to me we could just sort of protect-protect a time to make this happen.\n",
      "But that’s in hindsight because I’m probably at the time would have been like this is not going to be that effective.\n",
      "Not that it wouldn’t be that effective but-\n",
      "Interviewer: How quick necessarily.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Having gone through it, I’m like wow!\n",
      "Every single time, even with one session within 48 hours I can see a daily consistent change.\n",
      "But she is also a very hard worker.\n",
      "She wants it for herself, it’s not like I’m trying to nag.\n",
      "I don’t know if you have people who aren’t as motivated.\n",
      "You know, but for her- for us and for her, it was great sessions, great tools that, you know, she has even been able to adapt and apply even in other situations that she recognizes the feelings or the whatever.\n",
      "She’s like oh!\n",
      "You know, I don’t know she uses the tools she’s had.\n",
      "Also I think that the camps are kind of beneficial just knowing that you’re not- that it’s more common than you realize that people have things that they’re working on that affect them.\n",
      "Interviewer: So… maybe that might be helpful if people knew that or patients knew that coming in?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: That people also have these similar issues.\n",
      "Speaker: And people they can probably relate to on many levels.\n",
      "Not just, you know, not like oh this is another person that has something that would benefit from CBT but oh yeah they’re also, whatever, my age or they have full, whatever not just.\n",
      "Never mind I don’t know what I’m trying to say.\n",
      "Interviewer: You’re fine, you’re fine.\n",
      "Just kind of thinking about that experience.\n",
      "I know we’re kind of asking a lot of questions that are similar-ish so if this the same as another question and you have the same answer that’s fine.\n",
      "But just thinking about those experiences, were there any parts of therapy that were really confusing when you started?\n",
      "Or actually at any point?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "I mean I feel like it’s been very self-explanatory.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: To the point.\n",
      "It’s always actionable.\n",
      "Whatever they’re doing is like right away… and always reflective.\n",
      "It’s always based on what her comfort is so I think it gives her a sense of that it’s not just your plan that I’m having to follow but we make this plan together and at any time if I change my mind...\n",
      "It’s really still your own plan, you just have somebody to kind of guide you through it.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it’s collaborative.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s interesting, so she kind of saw hoarding as a self-protective, almost like a creation of a shell or a safe space?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes!\n",
      "Yes, that’s a great way to put it, like a shell or a safe place.\n",
      "And also she derived a lot of pleasure from it and obviously being someone who had been traumatized, she wanted to have a pleasurable experience and acquiring was one way in which she could do that.\n",
      "For some of the other patients, I have another patient that I saw for a while—I’ve never seen a more clear-cut case of actual cognitive deficit in a patient that may have led to hoarding as well as kind of impulsivity, and so it’s kind of different to see these different kinds of cases and how they manifested and what maybe led to their hoarding.\n",
      "For her, it was definitely like, she, I gave her a sorting task once and it took her like 12 minutes to sort 20 items that were clearly could be sorted in two minutes, and it was these five categories like newspapers, magazines, toiletry items, clothing items, that kind of thing, and she had significant difficulty attending, just making decisions about where things should go, wanting to kind of be right about a decision.\n",
      "Her hoarding seemed to stem a lot from this kind of problem as well as this kind of pleasure that would derive from her acquiring things and thinking like, “I may be able to use this thing in the future” or “this was given to me by someone”.\n",
      "She had every mardi gras cup she had ever collected every time she had been to mardi gras, and as a person who also saves a couple of mardi gras cups to kind of have for nostalgia reasons, I would never keep every single one.\n",
      "And for her if she got rid of one cup it truly meant that she had gotten rid of every single memory for her if she got rid of all of them at once.\n",
      "Interviewer: That kind of brings me to the next question really nicely, which is, again this might be different for different patients or it might be very difficult to say but, do you think that the explanations that people give to justify their hoarding behavior are post hoc justifications for an underlying pathological need?\n",
      "Do you think that the cognition justifies something that’s going on in the brain and is justifying it, or do you think that the justifications are actually what’s causing the behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: Gosh, that’s a very good question.\n",
      "To be honest, I think it’s both.\n",
      "I think that you could have—I mean when I think of other kind of like underlying cognitive mechanisms and factors just with any disorder, even with PTSD, having this bias that the world may be a dangerous place to be something that I kind of have early on, but then these experiences that I have reinforce that belief.\n",
      "And so I think that for hoarders it could be a little bit of both, maybe like there are some beliefs that they have that are them for some reason reinforced by these experiences and then they’re also post hoc reasons as to why they’re doing it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I agree that it’s a very difficult question to answer and it’s been very interesting.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, the questions you’re asking are so fascinating.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I can understand that.\n",
      "So, just to repeat back and make sure that I’ve got what you’re saying, it seems like there needs to be a piece that involves taking pleasure in items and in acquiring them and in having them, and not simply an inability to discard or clean up, that distinguishes the behaviors associated with hoarding disorder from the behaviors associated with, say somebody who’s badly depressed and who simply can’t get up and clean their house.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that’s sort of what I’m saying I mean I’ve definitely seen patients who have been depressed for a while, we actually just had a case recently where a guy came in, a veteran who denied hoarding—I’m going to talk freely about this I hope that that’s okay—it was a very fascinating case that they had asked me to consult on where he was essentially, I mean it was very clear that he was depressed and depression is seen as common [INAUDIBLE 19:10] diagnosis along with hoarding it’s pretty well established in the last couple of years despite what people think about OC it’s actually depression that’s more common, and for him he was very much clinically depressed and had been since deployment to the extent that he wasn’t even getting out of bed to use the bathroom he was actually just peeing in water bottles and throwing them on the floor so there became this question that given the nature of his home and how much filth and trash and [INAUDIBLE 19:37] there was, whether or not that was hoarding or whether or not it was something else, and I mean, technically he wasn’t discarding or parting with possessions and he denied having difficulties but yet he wasn’t doing it so there was this weird kind of like, “what is it?” and that’s an instance in which I’m feeling that the thing that separates hoarding from other disorders is the need to acquire and what that brings for you and to me he really wasn’t similar to the OC and other related disorders like that impulsivity.\n",
      "So, without that piece there to me it’s not hoarding, although according to the DSM, excessive acquisition is actually a specifier but it’s not a requirement and so that’s been one thing that’s been somewhat hard for me to kind of wrap my head around.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes total sense.\n",
      "Okay and now I’m going to read you a couple of the phrases from the criteria and I’d just like you to kind of talk through to me your thought process as you apply it to individual patients and I have some questions about them.\n",
      "So, one of the things that we’re interested in hearing about is this phrase, “persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value.”\n",
      "What we’re interested in is kind of how you determine actual value, like what makes a value judgement in a person with hoarding disorder inappropriate?\n",
      "Is it like a monetary?\n",
      "How do you determine if an emotional valuation is an inappropriate emotional valuation?\n",
      "How do you determine if an aesthetic valuation is an inappropriate aesthetic valuation?\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes total sense.\n",
      "The next criteria reads, “The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.”\n",
      "I’m wondering if there’s a degree to which something like the amount of space a person has plays into this.\n",
      "One could imagine two people with the same behavior, one of whom lives in a huge mansion is able to financially maintain eight storage units and the other who lives in a tiny trailer.\n",
      "You could imagine a person continuing to save and never actually having their living areas substantially compromised because they have access to so much space whereas the second person their active living areas would be probably compromised after eight hours of this behavior.\n",
      "So I’m wondering how you figure that into your diagnosis.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think you’re exactly right that the presence of clutter and the severity of clutter is influenced by a whole bunch of things that are completely external to the person’s psychopathology and for that reason (INAUDIBLE, 36:36) sort of hoarding special interest groups at the foundation and our little research conferences.\n",
      "I’ve really tried to, and I think other people have to, to really de-emphasize clutter as a diagnostic criteria because it’s a manifestation of the hoarding problem, but it is so dependent on other things.\n",
      "So the amount of space someone has, how much money they have, if they’ve got a lot of money and a giant house, you’re right, that clutter isn’t really going to show up because they have plenty of storage space to put their things.\n",
      "What I’ve seen is a lot of people that had to downsize and they moved from some giant house into a small apartment let’s say and all of the sudden now the small apartment is completely cluttered.\n",
      "Or they have the external storage areas if they can afford them.\n",
      "If they can’t afford them then they’ve got a clutter problem.\n",
      "So yeah that’s one big element that I think is external to the person’s pathology, has to do with financial and space issue, and the other one is the impact of other people in the home.\n",
      "So the child and adolescent people really brought this up is to say, if the kid has clear-cut hoarding symptoms with the other criteria met, but their parents are throwing their stuff away and preventing the clutter because mom goes in the room and cleans it up.\n",
      "So they don’t have clutter so therefore they wouldn’t meet the criteria if you didn’t have that other clause at the end that says, “If there isn’t current clutter it’s because of a third-party.”\n",
      "So that was a really important thing to put in their because otherwise you would never able to diagnose a child with hoarding disorder who had a parent who was cleaning up or somebody in college who had a roommate that forced them to sort stuff out or somebody who had a forced clean out by the house authorities or something like that.\n",
      "But this issue of space has not really been dealt with well in the criteria.\n",
      "There’s nothing in the criteria about kind of accounting for how much space the person actually has and that part of the criteria I think yeah is subjective and is kind of difficult because some people might have a pretty cluttered area but say, “Hey I can still use it” whereas another person would take a look at that and say, “No no no that’s not usable.”\n",
      "So it is a subjective part of it and again it has to do with how much insight they have, whether the clinician has seen a photograph of the area, or if they make a judgement as to how small the area is, it’s fuzzy.\n",
      "That’s unfortunately a pretty fuzzy part of the criteria, there’s a lot of subjectivity about how much use of the area is compromised or not compromised.\n",
      "Speaker: Anxiety, okay.\n",
      "Okay, so as I said, because it’s been really 4 or 5 sessions, and 2-3 sessions, it was just for the doctor to know him and understand, you know, what are the things that bother him, uh, so it’s been maybe 2-3 sessions that he has given him some techniques to help him with anxiety.\n",
      "So one of them was like breathing technique.\n",
      "If he feels like that, okay, he’s in a situation that he’s not able to focus and he feels he’s going to pick his nails because that’s one of the things he, uh, one of the things that he does when he’s anxious.\n",
      "He’s very tense, he actually picks his fingers, uh so, so he, the doctor told him try this uh technique.\n",
      "But he asked him to do it every day so he would become more comfortable.\n",
      "And then when the situation comes back that he’s anxious, it just comes naturally to him to think about okay, what I need to do?\n",
      "So um, so I think that was helpful because um, he doesn’t know he has anxiety.\n",
      "He doesn’t uh call it anxiety.\n",
      "He says okay, this is, okay this is what I feel, how I feel.\n",
      "But I think uh knowing [\n",
      "] and practicing, so it’s like training your brain.\n",
      "So it’s that, so in that sense I see the benefit of, you know, therapy that he’s getting.\n",
      "So that’s one technique that, um uh, actually he’s trying to actually do it every day and um.\n",
      "So the second session that he had, I wasn’t in the room so it was only him with the doctor but then I asked my son so it was like uh if there was a situation that he felt like that he doesn’t like it so he needs to think about it and come up with the question so that why I’m feeling that way?\n",
      "Is there any uh, is this my assumption?\n",
      "Or there could be another reason for what things are happening.\n",
      "So instead of thinking the worst scenario, so he could think okay maybe there was something that caused this situation and it’s not difficult.\n",
      "For example.\n",
      "If my mom is not picking up the phone, he might think oh there is an accident and that makes him to be anxious.\n",
      "Instead of that, he can think okay, what are the other reasons might be that my mom is not picking up the phone?\n",
      "So it’s with that, the things that might make him anxious, he could start asking questions and instead of choosing the first answer that comes to his mind, that oh maybe an accident happened, oh the worst thing that could happen, he could think about other scenarios.\n",
      "So I think that’s helpful.\n",
      "That’s uh, I’m not saying that, uh, she gets into those situations because I ask him every day, did you actually need to sit down and think about the situation because you were anxious?\n",
      "He said no. But at least, I think it’s good that he knows these are the things that he can use to help him to fight whatever he’s going through\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Right, so you think the CBT helps with the techniques and helps him with his thinking to be more rational?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, yeah exactly\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay.\n",
      "Um, so think of three words that describe how you feel about the kind of therapy.\n",
      "Um, what would those words be?\n",
      "Speaker: Um … the type of therapy he’s getting?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Mmhmm\n",
      "Speaker: Okay … um … thoughtful, calm … um less impulsive?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Thoughtful, calm and less impulsive?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay.\n",
      "And if you were to add a picture to each of these words, what would that be?\n",
      "Speaker: For calm, I’d put uh, I would say … river?\n",
      "Or ocean?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Mmmhmm\n",
      "Speaker: Um …\n",
      "Speaker: For thoughtful, um … I can’t come up with anything for thoughtful and\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Less impulsive\n",
      "Speaker: Less impulsive.\n",
      "Um, picture of two people.\n",
      "One is being shouting or being aggressive and the second person, uh taking his time,\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Not responding right away.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. I mean, I have paperwork and magazines and things like that that I need to throw all that out.\n",
      "It's just really hard to do because I think, what if I need the article that’s in here?\n",
      "Or, what if, you know, do I really need the, the car loan paperwork of a car that I haven’t owned in ten years.\n",
      "I mean, I should be able to just throw that stuff out, and it's just really, really difficult.\n",
      "Interviewer (28:16): Mhmm.\n",
      "So, what would you say is the most precious item in your house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Other than my pets?\n",
      "Interviewer (28:27): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, if I were to say the most precious item, inanimate, it would probably be… a toss-up between… my yarn— I was going to say my photos.\n",
      "But, to be perfectly honest, 90% of my photos are digitized and in the cloud now.\n",
      "Interviewer (28:58): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But yeah, it's really hard for me to throw away those prints.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:05): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And that's, and that's stupid.\n",
      "You know, if I have, if I have scanned and digitized all of those school pictures and all of those things, and I have got them saved somewhere out in the ether, why can I not throw away the physical hard copy?\n",
      "Interviewer (29:26): Right.\n",
      "So, for you, it's mostly just worrying that you're going to need it in the future.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:36): Or maybe it's sentimental value?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, it’s sentimental value.\n",
      "But honestly, the most, the most valuable thing to be that's in my house right now for me personally, other than living things like my husband and my pets, would be my, my yarn.\n",
      "I mean both physically and financially, that's probably the most valuable thing I have.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:03): Okay.\n",
      "So, I noticed you said financially, and I know we haven't really talked that much about whether things are important because they have financial value.\n",
      "But, is that generally an important aspect for you when you're trying to decide if you should keep something or not?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Sometimes.\n",
      "Yeah, sometimes.\n",
      "Sometimes I'll look at something and say, can I— you know, and my husband doesn't have this problem.\n",
      "He'll, he'll find an old, you know an old piece of electronic equipment, like a radio receiver or something, and he has no problem just giving it away or calling a friend and saying, “Hey, do you want this?”, without any regard to its value.\n",
      "You know, just give it to somebody because he doesn't want it.\n",
      "And that's kind of where I‘d like to be.\n",
      "Because I do look at things and say, oh you know, if I just had a yard sale I could probably sell this.\n",
      "Well, the reality is I'm not going to have a yard sale.\n",
      "I just have to, I have to, I just have to, I have to put my head on straight.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so now we’re going to kind of move into the section of the interview that talks about how to know hoarding behavior and what distinguishes hoarding as a disorder.\n",
      "So one of the things we’re interested in is the line between hoarding as a disorder and normal saving behavior or saving behavior that’s on the normal spectrum.\n",
      "So in your mind, what are the most important differences between normal saving behaviors such as perhaps collecting or even extreme collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: If I had to name one thing I would say it’s the impairment that it causes.\n",
      "I obviously think that that’s the nearest—there’s a very thin line between what we consider something that meets for this clinical and diagnostic criteria that we have and what doesn’t, and to me the kind of thing that I’m constantly looking for when I’m seeing symptoms of someone on the spectrum, which I think that most things are, is the impairment and is it really interfering with aspects of daily kind of functioning like social relationships, employment, occupational relationships, and tasks, and just kind of an overall a [INAUDIBLE 10:20] and living.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how do you distinguish impairment from just kind of like impact?\n",
      "What sorts of things do you look for when you look for something that is really impairing?\n",
      "I guess that’s maybe a tricky question but what I’m trying to get at is people change their lives and things have an impact on their lives, but what for you is really the line that pushes something like that into something that is an impairment?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a good question.\n",
      "I mean, I like for it to be something that the patient thinks is impairing, not something that necessarily a clinician or I am telling them that is impairing, although with hoarding that can be sometimes trickier given that sometimes patients aren’t coming necessarily on their own accord.\n",
      "So, I guess the things that I’m looking for are, “is it causing substantial conflict?”, not that it’s just impacting the relationship but that it’s causing substantial conflict or something like that in their relationship maybe with someone that is living in the home.\n",
      "Maybe their safety is at risk or the safety of others is at risk.\n",
      "Maybe financially they’re not able anymore to afford having multiple storage units or places to put their things.\n",
      "Maybe they don’t live in their home anymore and that’s becoming sort of a difficulty having to afford living in a hotel as well as having a home that you can’t use for its intended purposes.\n",
      "But I don’t have a great answer for that because that is tough.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Inside I'm a very organized person.\n",
      "My thought patterns.\n",
      "Everything is, is about organization.\n",
      "But when I look at it, I can't, I can’t bring that over to doing it.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer (41:12): Mhmm.\n",
      "It does, yeah.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:15): So, for you, you kind of feel like even though you know you want to be an organized person, and I know you would like to be an organized person and have some to have some organization, but it's hard to, you know, battle between your thoughts and you know, what you are actually doing.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Oh yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:33): Okay.\n",
      "So, have you ever in your life, tried to seek some professional help for hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know, I have not.\n",
      "I’ve thought about it, you know?\n",
      "But I’ve gone for help for mental issues, you know?\n",
      "Depression issues.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:51): Okay.\n",
      "And, do you think that's tied to the hoarding at all?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… yeah, I would think it is because, um, why else would I be so depressed when I look at it?\n",
      "Interviewer (42:03): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Interviewer (42:07): And, definitely I know for some people, the keeping the things kind of gives you some sort of satisfaction, right?\n",
      "Or, you know, makes you feel a little whole.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's like, um… for me it’s such a beauty, especially my cups and saucers and my roses and things.\n",
      "Every year, I go to [name of place; (42:30)], they have that cup display.\n",
      "and I bring my stuff to show.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:36): Right, okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, it's Judy and it's something to talk to people about.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:41): Okay, so keeping your stuff kind of gives you an opportunity to talk to other people, you know, and find people who have similar interest to you then.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:53): Okay.\n",
      "So, for you, would you say that, you know your collections have almost—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m sorry, I have to shut the door.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:59): Oh no, no worries.\n",
      "Would you say your collections have almost given you like social opportunities before?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh Lord, yeah.\n",
      "When I go, it’s in January.\n",
      "People just come up and talk and everything.\n",
      "I had one lady, this other little issue that may have been hoarding, is she gave me a box of cups and saucers that had belonged to her grandmother.\n",
      "And I was not gonna turn those down.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:27): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, because they were all pristine condition.\n",
      "Beautiful stuff.\n",
      "So, they’re up in my, um, laundry room.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:36): So, you definitely find it difficult then to turn things down, especially if you can see the beauty of the value in them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Okay. Well so that's the, that's most of the questions that I have for you today.\n",
      "I really appreciate your time.\n",
      "These were very interesting questions to go through with you.\n",
      "Just to close out, I'd like to ask you a really big vague question.\n",
      "So for you, what do you think the biggest things that we still don't know about hoarding disorder are?\n",
      "Or if you could answer one question about hoarding disorder, what would it be?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think there’s probably like an early developmental sequence, like an epigenetic sequence that combines like a genetic predisposition and early life experience to create this hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Like, harsh criticism from parents who also shows like an over episode that good, and that, social anxiety and fear, like soul meant this urge and I feel like there's lots of research studies on any one individual factor, but not like this holistic picture of how like your genes and your parenting and your attachment and your mental health problems converge and combine to create this, like I call it final common pathway.\n",
      "Interviewer: So the ways that all these different factors come together.\n",
      "Interviewee: Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Well, I really appreciate your time today.\n",
      "Thank you so much for speaking with me.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, that is very interesting.\n",
      "So, I guess the last piece of criteria that we’d like to talk through with you is something that you mentioned already and that’s about distress and how you assess this.\n",
      "So, the criterion reads, “difficulty discarding due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discarding them.”\n",
      "And so, how do you determine how much distress is normal or abnormal?\n",
      "And is it difficult to sometimes determine the level of distress when people have very low insight and deny having a problem?\n",
      "So perhaps say, “Oh, yeah, I could throw away this item anytime I wanted and it wouldn’t upset me and it would be fine, but I just choose not to.”\n",
      "How do you assess distress in that context?\n",
      "Interviewee: That is hard, typically what I do when I was treating patients is we would do a behavioral experiment in the first session where I would actually ask them to bring in a couple of items, and the idea was that I was going to keep the items for a week and then they would be returned back to the patient just to kind of see and to get a gage like you know kind of like an actual behavioral design or experiment to check what their distress level was regarding parting with the item at the moment.\n",
      "But even if you know it’s not going to be thrown away, is it still difficult to not have it and to wonder what I’m going to do with the item?\n",
      "And so that’s kind of one way—I would say most of the time people don’t have a problem, or at least from my own small sample of anecdotal evidence, I don’t have a lot of people telling me that they’re distressed if things get thrown away.\n",
      "But [INAUDIBLE 29:47] have been some occasions where someone felt [INAUDIBLE 19:50] something away, you know?\n",
      "And they got very upset about it, they got very angry, they couldn’t let it go, they’re still thinking about it staying in my office, and so it’s kind of sometimes easy to determine the distress.\n",
      "That patient I mentioned earlier, there was in incident in which it was much harder to determine.\n",
      "He was very—he was like, you know, we tried to asses hoarding and he was like, “I’m not a hoarder.”\n",
      "And then just answered zero on all the items on the hoarding scale, because he claimed he wasn’t distressed, but it was unclear to see.\n",
      "I would actually have to physically do an experiment we would go there and kind of toss away some of these things that are clearly trash and see how he reacts or responds.\n",
      "For the most part, I feel like people are more easily able to tell me that they’re highly distressed by the thought of getting rid of things.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, they are able to self-identify themselves as having distress?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, they are not as able to identify the impairment, I would say, that’s where the insight comes in for me.\n",
      "So, they’re not as able to determine that it’s a problem but they are able to tell me that, “yes it’s very distressing and if I were to get rid of this I would be very upset or sad or angry”.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:07): Okay, so mostly papers and records.\n",
      "Things like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:13): Okay, so how do you determine if those papers or those records are valuable?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s been an issue.\n",
      "I have gone on periodic bouts of disposing of one banker’s box of documents at a time and occasionally make progress, occasionally lose my momentum on that.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:44): Mhmm.\n",
      "So, when you do decide to throw some of these papers away, what usually goes through your mind when you’re trying to figure out what to discard or not?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "First, that HIPAA protected or financial information needs to burned, or it can be recycled because there isn’t confidential information.\n",
      "And then, if I’m thinking about retaining it, how would it be repurposed, or would it have been another matter?\n",
      "Interviewer (28:24): Okay.\n",
      "Can you think of any examples where that happened?\n",
      "Where you were going to throw something away, but then thought it might be useful for something else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "With the successful matters, I frequently hang onto the paperwork.\n",
      "Those who were involved will utilize it.\n",
      "And with the stuff with HIPAA or financial information, I have to bring that home, probably here for recycling and I oversee it [inaudible; (29:03)].\n",
      "Interviewer (29:04): Right.\n",
      "So, with any of the papers of the records that you’ve kept with the anticipation of using them later, do you often use them later, or do you sometimes not use them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "If I was confronted with the number of times that I’ve used what’s been saved, I would have to say out of the number of times that things have been saved, being reused is limited.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:35): Okay.\n",
      "So, the ratio of not using something to using something is pretty high.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:43): Okay.\n",
      "So, in terms of the items in your home, what’s most precious to you?\n",
      "So, outside of your office?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "At home, what’s most precious, I would say the human occupants.\n",
      "The um… there are a small number of rare documents left., There’s a small herd of musical instruments.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:23): Okay.\n",
      "What kinds of musical instruments?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "An amplifier and baseless guitars.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:30): Okay.\n",
      "And I know you mentioned earlier that some of these were broken.\n",
      "Were you including them when you were telling me that these were the most precious?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The ones that are broken are less precious than them.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:47): Okay.\n",
      "And why do you keep the broken ones around?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Part of it is keeping them around to cannibalize for use on other instruments.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:01): Okay, so you can like repurpose the parts and such?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, it is.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:08): Gotcha.\n",
      "And kind of like I asked earlier, how often do you actually find yourself repurposing these parts?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "About as often as the documents I’ve saved get reused.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:22): Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay, so, in your office then, what’s the most precious item?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably the hard drive that’s the backup.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, well, in that craft room.\n",
      "I've been trying to spend at least 30 minutes a day.\n",
      "But that's because I'm working from home.\n",
      "And that's where I keep my computer.\n",
      "I'm really wanting to— I'm trying to get that room to a point that I can work in there.\n",
      "I'm working in their full time, and I'm going to continue working in their full time— I'm not going back into an office.\n",
      "But, I want to make it a comfortable, a nice space.\n",
      "I want to make it a nice space for me.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:00): Okay, so you would say that because of you know, the quarantining, that's kind of motivated you a little bit more to clean the space?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:11): Okay, gotcha.\n",
      "So, now we're going to talk a little bit about what makes your possessions valuable.\n",
      "So, my first question is, um, literally just that.\n",
      "When it comes to your possessions, how do you determine if they have value or they don't have value?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, well, I guess it goes back to when I, when I look at things.\n",
      "It's things that I’m saving.\n",
      "They fall into one of two categories.\n",
      "They're either I'm saving them because they mean something to me.\n",
      "Like, gosh, people save greeting cards.\n",
      "I mean, I have saved greeting cards from stuff that my kids have given me, you know.\n",
      "And does it really matter?\n",
      "Should I be saving them?\n",
      "Probably not, but it's a really hard thing to throw away, something a child has given me.\n",
      "So, these all fall under sentimental, or they fall under— gosh, this is a great jar, this is a great box.\n",
      "Um, I'm sure I'm going to need this someday.\n",
      "I'm sure I'm going to wish I had this someday.\n",
      "And that's, there's, and there's the danger.\n",
      "So, what I was trying to do was clean out this, like this, craft room, and then give away like all the extra yarn.\n",
      "You know, the yarn that that I’m not personally going to use.\n",
      "Things that I don't like the color, I don't like the feel of it, I don't like whatever.\n",
      "I mean, I'm a, I'm a fiber artist.\n",
      "I knit, and I spin, and I weave.\n",
      "So, I have a lot of yarn, I have a lot of fiber.\n",
      "I'm always going to have a lot of the yarn and a lot of fiber, probably more than I could use, you know, in my lifetime.\n",
      "Knowing though, that at some point I will retire and will not have the money to spend on these things.\n",
      "So that part of it doesn't concern me.\n",
      "It's the other stuff.\n",
      "It's, it's like looking at this going, I hate this.\n",
      "Why am I keeping it?\n",
      "And then giving it away.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:35): Okay, so trash for you is something that you really just don't like, in terms of like, it's used or its appearance.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:54): Okay. And, in terms of like media and television, do you ever get any information about hoarding disorder from there?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "We don’t use much television or social media, but in my work I have a colleague who’s a clean-up specialist and he actually will rarely come onto a job if the owner’s still alive.\n",
      "It’s just easier with work if he doesn’t have a living client, and he’s relayed to me one time where the person was so distressed at the prospect of seeing that stuff removed that the day before the removal was to occur there was a self-initiated housefire.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:59): Wow.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And it was obviously upsetting for all of us.\n",
      "It was more than that client could deal with.\n",
      "[Colleague name]’s got a sensitive sight of those things where he’ll basically agree to work with heirs or after everyone’s gone.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:32): Right.\n",
      "So, you consider, you know, that sort of reaction vastly different from what your own might be, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m not planning on burning down the place, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:42): Right.\n",
      "Okay, so, where do you get information about hoarding disorder, if you do at all?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’ve heard about, well I follow a fair about, just about behavioral health, um, cognitive health.\n",
      "Um, my late mom was an Alzheimer’s patient.\n",
      "I identified fix issues with myself, and so when they would cover Monty’s book about the hungry ghost and acquisition, whether you’re a junkie or a therapeutic shopper, there’s similar characteristics.\n",
      "It appears to me that there are similar characteristics to those of us who like to self-medicate and others who shop recreationally.\n",
      "[Inaudible] try to put them in the same folder.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:01): So, it kinda sounds like the information you get about hoarding disorder comes from other like somewhat unrelated aspects of your life.\n",
      "Would you say that’s correct?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I guess I haven’t mentally filed another place for other addiction behaviors\n",
      "Interviewer (43:24): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s proven with a pint of Ben & Jerry’s or a bottle of scotch or buying new sweaters.\n",
      "I think there’s a similar dopamine— well, you know, in recovery I’m trying to find a new, safer dopamine substitute.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:52): So, for you hoarding is kind of like a side effect of other issues in your life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:59): Okay.\n",
      "So, when you hear the words hoarding disorder, do you have any negative connotations associated with it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… this will sound inconsistent, but you’ll be able to see how I am trying to be consistent.\n",
      "In the same way as other addictions, it’s— I don’t see it as a moral failing, I see it as an element of behavioral health.\n",
      "Some people run low on serotonin.\n",
      "Some people have got something else that is this kind of pleasure, and so they get their pleasure either in collecting records or collecting sweaters or— like me.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:03): Right.\n",
      "So, for you a desire to change these behaviors is more so a desire to cope with these feelings?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "That was the whole idea behind getting sober.\n",
      "I was an addict.\n",
      "I tried that.\n",
      "Found out what parts worked for me well, what parts didn’t work for me very well.\n",
      "I’m trying this other way, and there are these parts of it that work and there are other parts that are still a work in progress.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:37): Right.\n",
      "Okay so, that’s all the questions I have with regards to the hoarding.\n",
      "I just have a couple of demographic questions left, and then some information I need to collect so that we can pay you.\n",
      "Alright?\n",
      "[Personal demographic info…]\n",
      "Interviewer (48:37): Well if you have anymore questions, I am happy to answer them.\n",
      "But that is all I have for today.\n",
      "I want to thank you so much for participating.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Thank you for everything.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:45): No problem, and I hope you have a great day.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer (43:46): Okay, so moving off of that, in terms of, you know, the people you're meeting at these events, and also, I know you said that your niece and some other family members definitely have some issues with hoarding as well, do you think there's any way to tell if a person has problems with hoarding without going into their home or without seeing their stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, well, I can give you an example of my stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (44:18): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, my sister and I went down to Hard Rock, to play hard rock.\n",
      "Well, when we came out either one of us looked at the car.\n",
      "We looked at it, but when I went to crank my car it wouldn’t crank.\n",
      "Someone had jacked up my car on one side, took the entire assembly off the tire— the RAM, everything, okay?\n",
      "We went to call the police and I was so embarrassed because we had to get in the trunk.\n",
      "I probably had stuff in the trunk that had been there… eh, I’d say maybe two years.\n",
      "And, uh, the police dogs, they had to go get that little spare tire for me right into that, and they said, “Well, this looks like you’re a hoarder.”\n",
      "[Laughing] Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:03): So, for you, you could definitely maybe catch on that someone else might have problems with hoarding if they were maybe embarrassed?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "I used to see a lot of it when I worked for [name of fast food restaurant; (45:15)] because people would come up through the drive thru.\n",
      "And, all they have a place to sit in a car was in the driver's seat.\n",
      "Tons of stuff, tons of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:25): Right.\n",
      "Did you ever notice that, you know, the people that you realized had problems with hoarding, did they ever share like, similar personality traits that you also see in yourself?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I do.\n",
      "And I use my niece and my sister and I all for example.\n",
      "I use them for an example, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Uh, you know, my niece likes to do that too, but I have to be very selective now, because with Judy in my house now, uh, I’ve gone basically to my bedroom where all my crap is.\n",
      "So, um, I have to be a little bit more careful with that.\n",
      "I don’t know where I was going with that, but anyways…\n",
      "Interviewer (46:15): Oh no, no worries.\n",
      "Okay, so, then just a couple more questions and then afterwards, I'm going to ask you, just some basic demographic questions for your study.\n",
      "But um, to finish up here, because I know you said that you were in a bit of a rush—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I do apologize for that.\n",
      "Interviewer: And kind of along the same lines, when you say substantially compromises the intended use of the space.\n",
      "So, it, you know, there are cases in which people might decide to use, for example, a guest room as a storage area or a bathroom as a storage area.\n",
      "So, or even a kitchen, you know, if they don't cook, they could store things in their kitchen conceivably.\n",
      "Do you feel like this is something that plays into the use of this criteria?\n",
      "Like how do you determine intended use or is it really not even a, not even a factor in the diagnosis?\n",
      "Is it pretty clear?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don't think it matters what culture was assigned the use for that room, I just think it matters like, what you need to be doing on a daily basis is compromised.\n",
      "So like, have you don't have, you can't sleep on a bed because crammed with stuff and you can't watch TV, when you can't walk from this room to that room and you can't get to items in a room, like it's dependent on what like, normal living and movement required doesn't really matter what the room was assigned to them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "And kind of just as a follow up, so this is just kind of a speculative question, but in the same way that some people might really prefer to work in a, you know, like on a desk that's clear and that doesn't have any items out on it.\n",
      "Other people work on desks that are very cluttered and have papers everywhere.\n",
      "Do you feel like hoarding disorder could be some kind of variation in the amount of, the amount of clutter that one feels comfortable with or the amount of space that's taken up by things in a home?\n",
      "So…\n",
      "Interviewee: I do think that’s a factor, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think because of the fear element, having the item surrounding a person, it’s like literally a sense of security and they feel uncomfortable in empty areas or cleared out areas.\n",
      "So I definitely think that’s like a strong component.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, when people with hoarding disorder prefer cluttered spaces aesthetically almost, they feel more comfortable in them.\n",
      "Interviewee: And not even cluttered, but like literally fortress-like.\n",
      "Interviewer: And you kind of already spoke to this last criteria that I was going to ask you about, about, distress.\n",
      "And you brought up the idea that sometimes patients don't have the insight to know that they're distressed or to have distress.\n",
      "So I'd like to turn the interview to talking about insight pretty briefly.\n",
      "So the literature surrounding hoarding disorder describes hoarders is having low insight.\n",
      "How would you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Being aware that you have a problem that is not typical and that would be better off un-needing it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewee: It would be better for the individual, in themselves, if it were addressed.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how about kind of the comorbidity or is there ever confusion between different diagnosis?\n",
      "So, how would you make a distinction between someone who has comorbid depression and OCD versus a primary diagnosis of OCD plus hoarding?\n",
      "Is that ever a difficult distinction for you to make or do you feel like that's usually pretty straight forward?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think it is difficult, it can be quite difficult, particularly with hoarding behavior as a result of OCD versus a hoarding behavior that's a hoarding disorder.\n",
      "I think in hoarding behavior that relates to OCD, it often goes along with some of the more cardinal features of OCD, like superstitious fears that if I throw this away and it was a possession of a friend of mine, that that friend will die in a car accident, or saving items because you need to decontaminate them before you part with them or something like that.\n",
      "And usually with OCD, there's a range of OCD behaviors and hoarding might just be one of them; whereas primary hoarding doesn't necessarily have a range of features and primary hoarding often the insight is lower and primary OCD often the insight's better.\n",
      "But it can be hard, and then obviously there are people who you know, live in clutter but not because they have difficulty discarding but because they're experiencing dementia or depression or something that makes it difficult for them to expend energy cleaning, but I wouldn't say that they have hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like the first step for making the diagnosis is to look at the person's space and how their space is impairing their behavior, but then there's a second step that's kind of trying to figure out the root cause of that space and whether that space is driven by OCD-related thoughts, driven by depression or dementia, or driven by kind of a need to save that's a hoarding kind of need.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that sounds right.\n",
      "Yeah, it's the function of the saving, is it hoarding related or is it something else?\n",
      "Interviewer: So, now I'd like to talk just for another second about the DNS-V criteria.\n",
      "So, when you're applying these criteria, are there any elements of them that you regard as particularly difficult to apply or that you've thought that maybe different clinicians might apply differently?\n",
      "Either things to do with the language or the use of clinical judgment?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, I mean I think it's relatively straight forward.\n",
      "I don't know, I don't necessarily for every person I see, I don't necessarily sit down and do the skid with them to tick them off, I kind of feel like it's sort of [INAUDIBLE 19:50] and you get like a gut sense that it's a hoarding problem.\n",
      "But I don't think there's anything about the--I think the criteria are way better than prior to DSM-V, which is a useful diagnosis.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you sit down with patients, do you have them bring picture of their space or do they describe their space?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I do, I try to do home visits when possible so I can see it, but if not, then yes.\n",
      "Or I'll show them the clutter image rating so they can pick, but it is most helpful to just see their space.\n",
      "You know, most people can do that, just take a picture on their phone and show it to me.\n",
      "Interviewer: And, in your experience, the patients that come to you with high levels of insight already, how have they, or do you have any sense of how they have gained that insight on their own or before they've come to you?\n",
      "Interviewee: I’m sorry, I lost a little bit of what you said [INAUDIBLE 27:01)\n",
      "Interviewer: So when patients come to you and already are self-identifying as people who have a problem with hoarding disorder, do you have any sense of how they gained that insight or what the process was that led them to let them to come and seek treatment?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a tough one.\n",
      "I’m not sure that I can pin down a particular sense or how they got there.\n",
      "Yeah, so sometimes it’s, again, somebody has spoken to them about something or they’ve gotten in a situation where they’re facing constant criticism.\n",
      "[INAUDIBLE 27;47) that this is not working well.\n",
      "Others, you know, sometimes see it because of, it can be a case of where they’re dealing with other family members who are hoarders, actually kind of helps them understand that they had a problem too.\n",
      "Or, I had a woman who I worked with for a while, who got stuck trying to deal with her father’s estate, essentially, had tremendous piles of things and she was a hoarder herself, but her siblings were not.\n",
      "And, so there was this, you know, first of all, the experience of trying to deal with her father’s stuff and dealing with her siblings who were dispositioned to things, I think led to her understanding that it was really a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So it sounds like sometimes they can have conflicts with family members or other times they can have experienced it with a family member.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So first, we need to decide who will be in the video.\n",
      "So what characters do you think we should include?\n",
      "Speaker: Uh, I think parents should be there.\n",
      "Um, kids, parents definitely.\n",
      "Um … I think with um bullying being so common at the school, perhaps a scene at the school would be something.\n",
      "Like uh a classroom or playground where kids interact with other, you know other kids.\n",
      "Um, some of the uh anxiety might come from kids not feeling like that they’re not going to be accepted or feeling like oh I can’t say this because with my daughter, uh one thing that we tried to work on through the occupational therapy was that you shouldn’t care as much about what others think about you, or your thought.\n",
      "If you feel like that this is the right thing to say, you should say it.\n",
      "So I think it would be great if there is, if there is a scene that there are kids that are talking about, you know, um I don’t know, uh a subject.\n",
      "And if the kids think it’s the right thing to say, they shouldn’t feel like oh I’m going to be judged.\n",
      "And then uh uh so they could be able to say it without the fear of being judged or being bullied.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay, so kids have the confidence to say what they believe is right?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Okay.\n",
      "Um and you said, you mentioned that they should talk at school.\n",
      "Do you think there should be other scenes at like the home or the doctor’s office?\n",
      "Speaker: I think that would help too, doctor’s office because then kids don’t uh feel like oh I’m going to see a doctor you know, it becomes like uh, you want to make it like it’s not such a big deal.\n",
      "But some kids might think oh what’s wrong with me that I want to see a doctor?\n",
      "I’m healthy, there is nothing wrong with me.\n",
      "I think uh making it comfortable, making it like uh like it’s not such a big deal.\n",
      "The person is just going to be like, you know, someone like your parent, a parent, a teacher, that is going to help with the, with your anxiety, for example.\n",
      "So create the connection that uh kids have with teacher, they can have it with their therapist as well.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: That’s great.\n",
      "Um, so now we should decide what they will talk about.\n",
      "So you’ve already started mentioning this, how we should talk about what CBT is in simpler terms, but what other questions do our characters need to ask and answer?\n",
      "Speaker: Um … you mean uh in understanding what CBT is?\n",
      "Interviewer (49:28): SI understand.\n",
      "Okay, so, the last question I have for you is just about the gift cards.\n",
      "So, your Amazon gift card that you're going to receive, would you prefer that it would be electronic, or be like a physical gift card sent to you over mail?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I have a card from my first visit when I did something for that, um… I think a card would be fine because I'm sure that it’s—\n",
      "Interviewer (49:58): Right, so a physical gift card since you prefer the mail.\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "So, um, that should come in a couple weeks.\n",
      "Obviously, there might be some delayed because of, you know, COVID-19 and everything.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I am not worried about it.\n",
      "It will be just a little present.\n",
      "Interviewer (50:15): Definitely.\n",
      "Alright, so, again, if you have any questions at all, I'm here to answer them.\n",
      "But, I want to thank you for taking your time to answer these questions.\n",
      "It's really helping us out.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh honey, I’ll tell you what, um, when we went in our grandmother’s house to clean junk out we had to wait until she wasn’t there.\n",
      "When I saw all the stuff in there it just, it just, it causes me to feel a little bit of panic.\n",
      "Interviewer (50:40): Right, right.\n",
      "So, anything you can do to, you know, help yourself with this for sure.\n",
      "Okay, so any questions at all from you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I think you're wonderful.\n",
      "I hope I made you a little bit jolly today.\n",
      "Interviewer (50:55): Yes, of course.\n",
      "Definitely, yeah.\n",
      "Alright, well, I hope you have a great rest of your day.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Thank you, I appreciate this so, so much.\n",
      "Interviewer (51:05): No problem.\n",
      "Alright, buh-bye now.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: —in terms of whether people grow more isolated because of their behavior or their, you know, more isolated status enhances their behavior.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, well I think it probably goes both directions.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so this is a very big picture question as well.\n",
      "Do you ever feel that there are cultural forces associated with value that associate value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions that may play a role in the development of hoarding disorder or that…\n",
      "Interviewee: Why, I think if it’s a factor, it’s not a dominant factor.\n",
      "I mean, a lot of the things that I see people keeping, and hoarding, and the way they’re living, the serial status is not such a big deal as much as it is emotional comfort.\n",
      "Well, you know…\n",
      "Interviewer: So…\n",
      "Interviewee: Again, it’s related to these ideas that if I don’t have something, then I won’t feel bad.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about, so some people who study hoarding disorder place most of the emphasis on anxiety or negative emotions associated with throwing things away, whereas others really see it as important, the positive emotions associated with acquiring.\n",
      "In your experience, how does that balance out in the patients that you see?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I think it varies across patients, but I think that both elements are likely to be present in practically ever hoarder.\n",
      "That is to say, they’re getting some pleasure or satisfaction out of acquiring things or having a complete set of things, or something like that.\n",
      "Or, you know, getting a particularly treasured item, and I think that there’s, in almost all hoarders, or at least all hoarders I’ve ever worked with, a real avoidance and stress associated with letting go of those things.\n",
      "Interviewer: So for each patient there’s a little bit of both, for some there’s more of a positive acquiring, and for some there is more…\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think there is a variable mix, but I think most are present in practically everybody with hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about the relationship of memory to hoarding disorder?\n",
      "So, one of the things that you mentioned was people who are afraid of discarding because they're afraid of forgetting things.\n",
      "How do you feel that figures into…\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s an important part of what maintains hoarding, but I think it’s because of misunderstanding of how memory works.\n",
      "I mean, it, I think, all of hoarders have this innocent [INAUDIBLE 39:45) idea that memory is contained in the object.\n",
      "That, if I lose, I will forget it, rather than the memory is actually in my brain.\n",
      "And I can remember an object even if I don’t have it.\n",
      "And I think that that arises out of the fact that if you look at something then you remember things about it.\n",
      "So then, you make the mistake of thinking this memory is somehow maintained in the object.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting.\n",
      "So it seems to be the kind of like a, almost a cognitive mistaking the object with the memory.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:34): Right.\n",
      "So, uh, when you were with your second husband then, keeping things was definitely an issue.\n",
      "So, you felt couldn't keep things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yep, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:48): Okay.\n",
      "So, how does that situation compare to now?\n",
      "It sounds like you now have a little bit more freedom to have your own stuff.\n",
      "Are you living in a different house, or has this situation changed?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, my sister lives with me but it’s, it’s… She is, uh, a very judgmental person.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:08): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "And, um, she is the reason I can't even wear my [inaudible; (10:14)] to check my medicine.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:15): Right.\n",
      "And why is that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because she keeps [inaudible; (10:22)] it all the time.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Interviewer (10:23): Okay.\n",
      "So, it seems like you kind of feel like other people definitely don't want you to have, you know, the amount of stuff that you have.\n",
      "Has that always been a problem in your life?\n",
      "How about your childhood?\n",
      "Were your parents hesitant to let you keep things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, no. As a kid everything was fine.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "It was fine as a kid.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:44): So, mostly in your adult life then, you felt like people—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, wait.\n",
      "Way back, I’ll give you an example.\n",
      "I told my, my mother one day, “Judy is more my parent than you are because she’s up in my business all the time.”\n",
      "Interviewer (10:57): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:00): So, for you, it's more important to, you know, have your independence, and your stuff is kind of like, uh… you’re, you’re tying some independence to your stuff, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:13): You don't want people to mess with your things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:15): Okay, then I understand.\n",
      "So, I know you said it started to cause some conflict between you and your sister.\n",
      "But, uh, how about with your second husband, who you were talking about earlier?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, oh, what?\n",
      "Repeat.\n",
      "See, now I, I’m getting into [inaudible] my sister.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:32): Mhmm, right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, how much, uh, because I’m afraid to say anything if they’ll hear it.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:36): Yeah, no worries.\n",
      "No worries.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah, Um, okay what was my question?\n",
      "Interviewer (11:42): So, how about with your second husband?\n",
      "Has it been some cause of some conflict between you and him?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, no. I just, I couldn’t bring anything into the house.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:54): Okay, so, at that point, if you couldn't bring things into the house, were you hoarding at all?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I had, let me see… No, no. It wasn’t that bad at that time.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:11): Okay, but now that you have kind of more freedom to have your stuff in your own space, what is your hoarding like, if you could describe it for me?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… okay, ask me the question again.\n",
      "8:47 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And can you describe what this space is like, like if you were to tell me what it looks like, just describing as much detail as you can.\n",

      "It’s suburban, it’s 16 years old- the house is 16 years old.\n",
      "We had it built according to a plan that we modified.\n",

      "I have boxes of paper, and I have clothes piled up, and I have way too many dishes and kitchen related objects.\n",
      "10:04 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they're intended like stuff piled in the bathtub or stuff on the stove?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "At present, no. Although that has been the case in the past.\n",
      "10:23 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and what would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would like to have a place for everything and have everything in its place.\n",
      "And I would like to reduce the volume of possessions, maybe 20%.\n",
      "10:43 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so organization and decreasing the amount of stuff.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "10:51 Interviewer:\n",
      "And how important are your items for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’d say important, I mean, you know, very important.\n",
      "11:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "And which objects are the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "There’s some furniture, dishes.\n",
      "I mean obviously appliances and, you know, things like that that make the house physically comfortable.\n",
      "Yeah, there’s certain pictures...\n",
      "11:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so like sentimental items that you don't, you can't part with.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "11:49 Interviewer:\n",
      "OK, so moving on to this section about value.\n",
      "So when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Sometimes it's associations.\n",
      "Sometimes its intrinsic value or maybe the beauty of something.\n",
      "Sometimes the association, you know, with a particular person.\n",
      "Sometimes it’s a memory prompt.\n",
      "12:29 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so definitely a theme of sentimentality.\n",
      "And just when you see the object, you think of something or someone.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "12:42 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so what do you discard?\n",
      "What is trash for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, advertising and envelopes and you know expired coupons and stuff like that is.\n",
      "Once I have it in my hand, and I can see what they are, I don't have a problem with discarding them.\n",
      "If an object like an article of clothing is stained or damaged in some way, I don't have a problem with that.\n",
      "13:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "So if something has no use anymore, you know it's time to throw it away.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "13:32 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and what is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh well, besides like dogs and living things... I have a dresser that’s very nice.\n",
      "I suppose it would be that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… well, I buy them sometimes because I like the, um, the beauty of the work.\n",
      "But I don't collect anything that's really expensive.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:55): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I, I don’t normally do that.\n",
      "And, then I’m doing a little better now because, um, I’ll go in, look at things, I’ll put maybe [inaudible] things, six things in the buggy, and then I will decide which one I have somewhere to put.\n",
      "So, I am doing better with that little bit.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:13): Gotcha.\n",
      "So, when you say you're doing better, how does that compare to how it used to be?\n",
      "So, how has that gotten better?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… okay, um, they’re talking so I’m having trouble hearing.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:27): Oh, no worries.\n",
      "I asked you, uh, you said that that's gotten better a little bit.\n",
      "Can you kind of describe how it's gotten better for me?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I can see one side of my bed.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:38): Okay, right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I can see one side of my bed.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:43): So, there was a time where it was kind of unusable then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh my god I would have fallen.\n",
      "I mean I haven’t, um, [inaudible; (16:53)] my feet.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:57): Okay.\n",
      "So, at some point, it was almost dangerous then, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah, oh yeah.\n",
      "Definitely, definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:08): So, other than your bed being relatively unusable at that point, are there any other parts of your house that you can't really use, or objects that you know don't serve their intended purpose because of the hoarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It's, it's just, you know, I see something and even though I don't necessarily need it, I want it.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:37): Right?\n",
      "So, has it kind of impacted the way that you can use certain parts of your house—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:46): Or maybe made a room unusable?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:50): Okay, so can you touch on that a little bit for me?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Can you wait on here for a minute, I’ll be back in a bit.\n",
      "I Have this thing I have to do.\n",
      "Sorry about that.\n",
      "I’ll be in in a minute.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, just let me uh, finish this please… Okay, unfortunately, repeat that question.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:39): No worries at all.\n",
      "So, I asked, um, I know you mentioned that your bed was kind of unusable at one point, but are there any other, um, parts of your house, or objects in your house that you can't use, or they aren't being used in the way they were intended to be used because of the hoarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, let me see… No, no. Not, not really, cause uh, my sister cleaned out my utility room.\n",
      "Interviewer (19:08): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, so I can now get in my utility room.\n",
      "Interviewer (19:12): Okay, so how about before she cleaned it out?\n",
      "What was that like?\n",
      "Interviewer (41:15): Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "So, when it comes to people that have, you know, like issues with clutter, like you have identified with yourself.\n",
      "Do you think that there's any way to tell that someone has clutter issues without actually seeing their space?\n",
      "I know you mentioned earlier that maybe they're a bit reclusive more so than usual, but is there anything else that you might notice in someone?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, somebody who can never find what they're looking for.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:41): Okay.\n",
      "So, you know, disorganized in their thoughts.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, you know, in my job, in my day to day job, I have to be organized.\n",
      "I mean, it's just, it's a requirement of my job.\n",
      "But if somebody said to me, hey, don't forget you were going to lend me XYZ.\n",
      "I would have to really stop and think, where would I start looking for this in my house?\n",
      "And so, and in some cases, I've had to say you know I, I know I bought this, but I don't have any idea where I put it.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:26): Right.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:27): And most of the time, some of the times you can write that off to be, you know, of a certain age and your memory starts to crap out on you.\n",
      "And I'm kind of at that certain age.\n",
      "But, in a lot of cases it's because I didn't put it where it should be, whatever that should be is.\n",
      "Like you know, hey, you have to pay your driver's license tags.\n",
      "Where's the paperwork?\n",
      "Well hell, I don't know.\n",
      "You know, and then I start rifling through stacks of bank statements and other kinds of things that I probably should just shred and get rid of, because it should be— it's all electronic anyways.\n",
      "Why am I keeping those?\n",
      "But that would be a way for me to know without actually seeing somebody’s space, is somebody who can never find what they're looking for.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:28): Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay, so, um, is there any like time in your life where your problems with clutter maybe got in the way of something that you wanted to do, or something that you had planned to do?\n",
      "Anything like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah, when I can't find something that I need.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:46): Okay.\n",
      "Is there any particular instance where that happened that you can remember?\n",
      "Interviewer: Alright so just to start, can you tell me what comes to mind when you think about CBT or cognitive behavioral therapy- the therapy that we talked about?\n",
      "Speaker: What comes to mind would be real-time applicable practicing different scenarios that base some sort of psychological- internal thing that’s going on with a person but try to simulate and actively address but it feels like, what it looks like and then continuing to sort of arming someone with tools so that they’re able to get used to that sort of feeling and how to handle themselves when they’re potentially experiencing that for real.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So really simulating a real life experience and giving them tools for helping with that.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Sounds like you do know quite a bit about CBT, have some experience.\n",
      "Could you kind of tell me what you do know about CBT in general?\n",
      "Or how would you explain it to someone else?\n",
      "If it’s any different from what you said.\n",
      "Speaker: Sort of- I feel like it’s like thinking about, sort of that metacognition where you’re thinking about your thinking.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: Normally you aren’t asked to do that unless it’s sort of causing some sort of distress to one’s self to think about what you’re thinking with certain things.\n",
      "I lost my train of thought…\n",
      "Interviewer: You were talking about metacognition and thinking about thinking when normally you wouldn’t do that.\n",
      "Speaker: What was your question now?\n",
      "Interviewer: Oh, my question was just how would you explain CBT to someone else?\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "Yeah it would be thinking about your thinking and then sort of like almost working backwards to try to feel like, okay this is, you know, this is the end of result of something and backtracking to think what was it that got me here or what was I doing or what patterns or habits am I seeing that are continually arriving me at this result.\n",
      "I always feel like you can pinpoint a result but then trying to figure out what got us here or why are we here and then sort of working backwards from that and realizing the thought process that kind of preceded wherever you are right now.\n",
      "That you don’t want to be.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right so realizing this is the result…\n",
      "Speaker: A thought process that happened and kind of thinking about okay recognizing where does this start?\n",
      "What was the beginning of this?\n",
      "If you can recognize that start, kind of trying to- you’re gaining tools that will be able to- you can, when you find yourself in that process or anywhere in there realizing hey I’m familiar with this.\n",
      "I kind of know where this is going to go and trying to stop the cycle or sort of divert into something else so you don’t end up in that same spot again.\n",
      "I don’t know if I’m making any sense right now.\n",
      "If I could draw a picture, yeah I’m such a visual person about it.\n",
      "But to me that’s what it is to sort of- realizing that there are patterns that are happening and you’re uncomfortable with and that are in some way you would seek this sort of therapy out by because you recognize that you’re not happy or you’re uncomfortable or that in life things are limited for you because of this thing that is happening over and over but then recognizing, like backtracking and recognizing the signals of it’s coming.\n",
      "So that you can try to prevent continuing that spiral or being in that situation or frame of mind again over and over.\n",
      "Interviewer: So there’s, you know, those thoughts having something to help you with preventing it from spiraling.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So kind of, either when you came here or for summer camp.\n",
      "Was summer camp before you came here or did you come here first?\n",
      "Speaker: Here first.\n",
      "Interviewer: So rather than trying to force it on them, you get them to kind of say it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, versus getting them to understand what are some of the benefits of changing the behavior?\n",
      "What are some of the cons of changing this behavior?\n",
      "What are some of the benefits of not changing?\n",
      "What are some of the cons of not changing?\n",
      "So just really like changing that approach to getting them to elicit some of the reasons why change might be helpful or might create less stress for them and working with them there.\n",
      "The other thing that I typically do is try to get them to think about, you know, it’s reasonable to want to save things, it’s reasonable to think that you may be able to use them again in the future if it’s sentimental or that kind of thing, but also getting them to think about are these things that are really easy for you to get rid of that you’re just not getting rid of right now?\n",
      "And so, kind of getting them to start on the smaller scale and working their way up.\n",
      "Interviewer: One thing that we wanted to talk about, and I’m getting towards the end of the time that we have today so I want to make sure to get these last couple of questions in, when you talk to patients with hoarding problems, what—and this might be a difficult question for you to answer to feel free to tell me—when you talk to patients with hoarding problems, what ideas do they have about what’s caused them to have these problems?\n",
      "What do they think?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s actually a great question, I’ve actually talked with the people that I’ve worked with a lot.\n",
      "So, one of the ladies that comes to mind, I was working at her home disability [INAUDIBLE 40:16] and she was staying in the extended stay.\n",
      "We worked on her home for over a year and we would spend a lot of time while we sorting and organizing trying to do decluttering exercises and talking about what caused it.\n",
      "She really linked it to a rape that had happened to her in her late teen kind of early adulthood period, as well as a number or string of stressful life events that occurred relative to a decade of time and she actually had become morbidly obese as well and she basically said that, “no one would break into my home or try to hurt me if I am obese and if they can’t really get into my home.”\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So, we talked a little bit earlier about the different reasons that people with hoarding disorder give for their behavior.\n",
      "You know, we talked about the belief that it might be valuable, that they might need it later.\n",
      "Do you feel that these justifications for hoarding behavior are post hoc reasons to justify what is essentially an underlying biological need or pathological need?\n",
      "So, to rephrase that question, which comes first, you know, the explanation for saving or the saving, do people just save and then justify their behavior or are these reasons that they give really the reasons that they do it?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that’s a very difficult question to answer.\n",
      "I don’t think there’s research telling us the answer one way or another.\n",
      "But I do think that the core there’s like something in-between the two, which is like an instinct, an instinct to not release value but to hold on to something.\n",
      "And the instinct can be given like fancier sounding explanations that sound more logical than just like an urge or instinct, but yeah.\n",
      "I would say I’m voting for something in-between.\n",
      "And if you make me pick, I’ll pick the biological first and then the explanation.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, when you typically see patients for your research, what do they tell you about how long their behavior has been going on?\n",
      "When did it start generally in the course of their life?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "My impression that there’s like signs of it early on, and especially in like adolescence and young adulthood, but it does not become a real problem until adulthood.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "And is your sense of why that I because the behavior itself worsens like a progressive disorder, or is it more related to social forces, ;ike having the ability to have your own house or becoming socially isolated?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say it has to be both.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So both progressive and related to social process.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: What does it, do you find that there's a relationship between these behaviors and, so again, it's kind of a chicken and the egg or a causation problem.\n",
      "Do people who are hoarders tend to be more isolated or, or do you think that it's more that their hoarding makes them isolated.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think they start, they’re more isolated.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So they’re more isolated to begin with.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think just like fear and anxiety, and then depression that feeds into hoarding disorder makes people, yeah, prefer to be alone and to protect themselves from others.\n",
      "Interview 019\n",
      "Interviewer: So, we're gonna talk more about that as we go through the interview.\n",
      "Those are all the listing prompts that I have for you and I'd kind of like to dive into the more free form portion one.\n",
      "The way that I like to start out is have you talk through from your perspective as a clinician, what are the biggest and most important differences that in your mind distinguish people with hoarding problems form normal saving behavior, maybe perhaps extreme collecting, and this disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so it's interesting that part of it really kind of depends upon the space that the person is living in and the number of possessions.\n",
      "Like, some people may tend to hang onto things and have a cluttered garage or something like that, but it really becomes a hoarding problem when the number of possessions just vastly takes over the spaces.\n",
      "But in a funny way, someone who lives in a suburban mansion can have an equal number of possessions as someone and not have a hoarding problem as compared to someone who really has a hoarding problem because they live in a small apartment with a high number of possessions.\n",
      "Interviewer: That's actually something I was gonna ask you about later in the interview.\n",
      "So, if you have two patients, one of whom has a lot of control over their space, has like you said a suburban mansion with many many many rooms and perhaps the capacity to buy multiple storage units, and you have another patient who's living in a very small apartment or a trailer and they're exhibiting the same behavior, like let's say for the sake of argument, literally the same behavior, they have the same number of items, one of their spaces is going to be extremely congested and the other one, you might not see the items at all.\n",
      "So, do they both have hoarding problems?\n",
      "Are they both going to get the diagnosis?\n",
      "Is neither of them?\n",
      "It's kind of a question.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, so I wouldn't make the hoarding diagnosis unless there's impairment, and impairment would come from the lack of functionality of the space or the distress level.\n",
      "Like if somebody lives in that mansion and they have a ton of possessions and it doesn't clutter any rooms, really because there's so many rooms, and it doesn't bother them that they have so many possessions, I would not diagnose them with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:59): Okay. So, when information about, you know, hoarding disorder, how would you say that its similar or different from your own disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay so, from a— the reason I don't like the word hoarding is, although I have used it on myself in the past, um, but part of the reason I don't like that word is because it indicates— it's gotten an indication through, you know, for better or for worse— through you know, through television programs or whatever.\n",
      "That, um, you know, it's somebody who has you know, 14 cats and the house is condemnable.\n",
      "And, you know, and when I look at my house, my house is just a mess.\n",
      "It's just cluttered.\n",
      "It's not falling apart around me.\n",
      "If I needed to sell it tomorrow, I probably could do that.\n",
      "And, you know, it's not— my neighbors don't see you know, things piled up on my deck or, you know, outside my fence.\n",
      "You know, it's all presentable.\n",
      "It's just more than I need.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:25): Right.\n",
      "So, your own clutter—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And it stresses me out.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:28): Right.\n",
      "Your own clutter then is definitely less severe than what you would associate with, you know, hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Though that’s not to say that I don't have those tendencies.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:40): Okay.\n",
      "So, maybe there are some similarities but definitely—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I do recognize me.\n",
      "So, I mean, I do recognize myself in those things when, when I see, you know, people interviewed.\n",
      "And I don't watch those shows, to be perfectly honest.\n",
      "I've never seen them other than to have them show up, like in a commercial on one of the channels.\n",
      "Um, and you think, oh my god, you know.\n",
      "What's underneath all of that stuff?\n",
      "And there must be bugs, and this and that.\n",
      "And mine isn't like that.\n",
      "But, when they talk about their things, I did try watching some of that, um, Marie Kondo.\n",
      "Um, Tidy up.\n",
      "And I have the book that I bought before she was on Netflix.\n",
      "I had this book for a long time, because I recognize that I would like to have a different type of lifestyle.\n",
      "Um, but… And I've watched those things.\n",
      "But when she interviews people, like when they're throwing away things out of their closets and they’re just really distressed about it, I feel that in my core.\n",
      "I mean I just know.\n",
      "I know how they feel.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:59): Mhmm.\n",
      "So, you can definitely relate to the distress that they feel when they're trying to, you know, clear up a little bit.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, and it breaks my heart because I'm in the same place.\n",
      "Like I want to be the person who gets their stuff cleaned up.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I have a similar plastic bin in my bed.\n",
      "Um, I have um, two closets.\n",
      "Oh, the other thing I'm kind of crazy about is purses.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:14): Purses, gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah, purses are a big one.\n",
      "That’s a major one.\n",
      "But, you know what I was getting their blessing, but with the stores being closed I can't go in and buy things, so, I'm actually paying on my cards.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:26): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, that's a positive thing.\n",
      "Yeah, I do like purses, I like wallets.\n",
      "Uh, you know, whether I need it or not, it’s selling.\n",
      "That’s the way it is.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:37): Right.\n",
      "So, you know, from an outside perspective, would you say someone might think you had an excessive amount of clothes, or an excessive amount of purses or wallets?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Yes, definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:49): Okay.\n",
      "And so, where you keep these?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I have uh, purses in— I have a smaller closet in my bedroom, and I’ve got a larger one.\n",
      "They’re on the shelves.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:02): Gotcha.\n",
      "And are they organized, or would you say they're more cluttered?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Definitely the wallets and stuff are definitely cluttered.\n",
      "The purses I, I actually spent an hour just trying to figure out how to put them somewhere based on size, and how they need to stand up and stuff like that.\n",
      "But that took me an hour right now.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:22): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But there's a lot I never even touched, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer (23:26): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:29): So, ideally, you like to have these organized when you can?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, I would love to be organized.\n",
      "I love to be able to get my hands on things.\n",
      "And uh, yeah, yep.\n",
      "So, it would be very important to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:42): Going off that, what would you ideally like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It would, uh… I would love it clutter-free.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:50): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Where I could get to my [imaudible].\n",
      "My bedrooms are dusted.\n",
      "Nothing on the floors.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:58): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know, just, just being able to see my wood drawers would be so nice.\n",
      "See that stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:04): Right.\n",
      "So, it sounds like there's a lot of stuff now, like on the floor and kind of like blocking the way of maybe getting to some of the furniture.\n",
      "Is that what I'm hearing?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, it is getting better.\n",
      "I have managed to, to do some stuff.\n",
      "But, what I found myself doing, but when you're also through with it, I’m putting it on the darn bed.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:24): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, that's making it worse, and then I have to unload half the stuff back in my bed at night, you know?\n",
      "Isn’t that horrible?\n",
      "Interviewer (24:33): Mhmm.\n",
      "No, I understand.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:36): So, you know, in comparison with all the rooms in the house, are there any that are, would you say clutter-free?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Fewer people come into the house, although a whole lot didn't come to begin with, but like there is somebody that comes in and cleans, and she was gone for two, three months, and now she just started to come back.\n",
      "But I think we might have to put her on hiatus again because I'm not sure what she's bringing into the house when she comes.\n",
      "30:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so that unknown- it's scary.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "30:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "So has the COVID-19 pandemic affected your acquiring habits, like including buying or acquiring free things or anything?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I actually do think I’m shopping online more than I was.\n",
      "30:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah I agree with that, for myself.\n",
      "So online shopping is definitely one of the things that has come up for you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, and maybe food hoarding for the household, like we’ve got a quarter of a [30:41] INCOHERENT, but maybe that’s reasonable, I’m not sure.\n",
      "But our freezer in the garage is packed, cabinets are all packed.\n",
      "30:52 Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you do that so you have to go to the grocery store less.\n",
      "Like buying in bulk so you don’t have to go back as soon?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s part of it, but I think it’s also just because of feeling more insecure generally and having a surplus is somehow comforting.\n",
      "31:14 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and how has COVID-19 affected your difficulties with discarding and clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because I can’t go out, or I don't go out and distract myself with other things.\n",
      "And then in the house, perhaps more than usual, I put it in my face a little bit more (?).\n",
      "31:44 Interviewer:\n",
      "And you also mentioned reading books about organization, has COVID-19 affected your attempts to declutter, and have you had more time to organize?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have plenty of time- I did and I do, and I just haven’t done it.\n",
      "32:03 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and has it impacted your overall physical health?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I don’t think so.\n",
      "32:13 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and has COVID-19 affected your overall mental health or well being?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "I mean, I'm having more bad dreams and just generalized anxiety.\n",
      "32:28 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, and finally, how has COVID-19 affected you or your family financially?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably not much.\n",
      "I mentioned we were retired, so our income stream really hasn't changed.\n",
      "Our tenants continue to pay their rent.\n",
      "I think we're going out and not going out to eat and saving money that way.\n",
      "On the other hand, there is more shopping but online shopping, but I think it kind of balances out.\n",
      "33:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Um, so we're finally in our last section and it's about COVID coping.\n",
      "So how have you been coping since the start of the COVID pandemic?\n",
      "Like, are there any specific techniques that you have found helpful with coping with your anxiety or your clutter?\n",
      "Interviewer (31:39): Okay, and that kind of seems like it’s just a matter of utility, right?\n",
      "That seems like a very useful thing, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yup.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:49): Okay.\n",
      "So, if you were to somehow lose this external hard drive, that would be pretty traumatic I assume.\n",
      "But, what about the precious items in your home that are maybe less useful, but you still have a lot of value in?\n",
      "What would happen if say, suddenly your musical instruments were to disappear?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I’m trying to remind myself that they’re things.\n",
      "I recognize that if we were to not live in a hurricane zone— you’re University of Florida is that right?\n",
      "Interviewer (32:32): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, you’ve been visited by I-don’t-know how many destructive hurricanes.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:40): Right, a number of them.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I’ve never experienced the trauma of watching a roof come off, or the trauma of being up to your knees in floodwater washed through.\n",
      "That sounds devastating.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:57): Right, so you’re able to kind of recognize that it isn’t a catastrophic deal if things are lost.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, uh— yes, I’m agreeing with you.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:11): Okay, so if you had to choose between a number of the items that you just told me were really precious to you, how would you choose between them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s an ongoing power game at one of the‚ actually the only social media site that I participate in.\n",
      "You know, “if there’s a fire which would you grab?” And that’s mostly a power game.\n",
      "But, there’s, that would probably be one of the electrics and one of the acoustics.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:46): And why would you choose those?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, the red Deli(?) it’s because the funds that we used to buy it came as a result of a modest inheritance from my maternal grandmother.\n",
      "And the Casey(?) acoustic it was, uh, selected for me, recommended for me by a performing artist I’ve got a relationship with.\n",
      "He was right, it’s a pretty good guitar.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:20): Right, so both of the things that you would choose to keep, there’s an aspect of sentimentality with them, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:28): Okay.\n",
      "How about monetary value?\n",
      "Do you assign a lot of worth in something that’s financially valuable?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s actually discussed quite a bit on the social media site as well.\n",
      "There’s all, we’re a bunch of aging Boomers who put a bunch of value into just wood and wire.\n",
      "And, recognizing that the next generation that follows may not hold some of the same reverence for the British phase that some of us did, and our stuff will just be crap that’s gotta be thrown away.\n",
      "And, in some of our cases that’s helping us— it’s certainly helping me— to resist further acquisition.\n",
      "A person with my gaping schedule has no reason to have more than eight guitars.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:32): So, for you if something is financially valuable, that’s not necessarily as important?\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, I guess I want to return just for a second to this idea of space.\n",
      "Would it be possible in your mind for somebody to have hoarding problems but for those problems to be focused on digital media?\n",
      "So, somebody who saves PDFs of books the same way that somebody might save physical books, and all of their emails and have multiple hard drives where they're hoarding digital media?\n",
      "Would that fit criteria and how would you think about that in terms of the criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that's interesting.\n",
      "I've heard a little bit about this cyber hoarding or whatever, digital hoarding.\n",
      "I think there's a similarity in terms of like often there's a fear of making a mistake deleting something is similar to making a mistake throwing something away, but if I had to make a diagnosis I would probably make an OCD diagnosis, rather than a hoarding disorder diagnosis just because I feel like the physical clutter has to be present for hoarding.\n",
      "But I mean if there's both, if the person is digitally hoarding and they're physically hoarding, then maybe you could just go with a hoarding disorder diagnosis and not an OCD one.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, now I'd like to turn to a conversation that's about the problem with insight.\n",
      "So we have this last criteria of distress, which we talked about in terms of it being the distress that would accompany discarding.\n",
      "And I wonder if, when you encounter patients who have lower insight, if you ever have difficulty getting them to express that distress if they're so in denial about the fact that they have a problem.\n",
      "That they might say something like, \"Oh no, I could throw this away any time and it wouldn't bother me,\" despite the fact that they don't do that and if that ever presents a problem for you?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, definitely people will say stuff like that, \"I could get [INAUDIBLE 22:25] if I wanted to, I just don't want to.\"\n",
      "And so I think the sort of denial is a real thing and sort of like an alcoholic saying, \"I could quit anytime I want.\"\n",
      "But, yeah, so I think [INAUDIBLE 22:49] there's people out there, folks with hoarding problems who would like the general idea, it would be nice if I had fewer things, I would be happier, I would be better able to have people over, I would have fewer arguments with family members, but when it comes down to picking a specific item, they lose the forrest for the trees because they're focused on that particular item and they forget that bigger picture.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, they might think generally it would be better for me if I had fewer things and I would like to discard, but in the particular instance, that's when they experience the distress.\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhmm, that makes sense.\n",
      "Um, so I kind of want to take a step back from the problem of insight and ask you first of all how you think about this concept in your practice.\n",
      "How would you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Recognizing that the saving behaviors are excessive, or that they're problematic.\n",
      "Yeah, something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:25): Okay, so what do they look like?\n",
      "Can you describe the cluttered areas for me?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, so, um, like in my bedroom, I have got, um, right now there's a pile in front of one of the closet doors that includes a green trash bag that I've been throwing clothes in to donate.\n",
      "And it just, it stays there.\n",
      "And, I should have donated it ages ago, but it's still there.\n",
      "There's also one that has shoes in it for the same reason.\n",
      "Um, I think there's a ruck tote under there, and an old computer bag, and just stuff.\n",
      "And I don't need to have it, but I don't have the motivation to get in there and get rid of it.\n",
      "My floors are, um, in my, my bedroom, are overflowing.\n",
      "Because I have more t-shirts or tops then I probably need, but I haven't gotten rid of them.\n",
      "I have mismatched socks, like single socks, that— why am I keeping this one sock?\n",
      "I don't know, I guess maybe I'm figuring that the other one’s gonna show up someday.\n",
      "But, you know, obviously it's not.\n",
      "Um, so my bedroom is you know, it's kind of a wreck.\n",
      "But, it's not like I can't walk in there, or I have to, you know, move things off the bed to go to sleep at night.\n",
      "It's not like that.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:06): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It's just not, it doesn't look like, you know, a magazine house.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:17): Okay, so—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It definitely looks lived in.\n",
      "And even the crap room, you know.\n",
      "I mean, I've got a couple of spinning wheels in there, and some other things that isn't clutter, but all of the accessories, and the fiber, and all of that is just, you know, it’s in bins on the floor.\n",
      "And, and I just, I'm not going to get rid of that.\n",
      "That stuff I'm not going to get rid of, it's kind of my sanity.\n",
      "But I haven't figured out a way to score it yet that doesn't require it to be in clear totes stacked up against the wall.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:57): So, are there any areas of the house, or maybe like appliances, that you can't use because of the clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. Interviewer (21:05): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know, like actually there's not.\n",
      "You know, I mean, we store stuff in the oven, but you can pull that stuff out, you know.\n",
      "It's like pots or pans or whatever.\n",
      "It's all oven-type stuff that’s stored in the oven.\n",
      "Because I live in a very small house.\n",
      "That’s part of the problem is that the house is small.\n",
      "The closet space is at a premium.\n",
      "And, if I were a minimalist, I could probably live here just fine, but I'm not.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:37): Right.\n",
      "So—\n",
      "Interviewer: So, the criteria there is about difficulty discarding possessions that congest and clutter living areas that substantially compromise intended use, as you just talked about.\n",
      "And, again, I kind of want to push on that and say, for instance if a person has multiple guest bedrooms that they're not using as bedrooms but they're instead using as storage spaces, is that compromising intended use?\n",
      "I mean, a bedroom only had to be a bedroom according to the architect that built the house, the person who lives in it could use their bedroom for storage and I guess, you could even push that further and say they could also use a bathroom for storage, if they have a spare bathroom, or even a stovetop if they don't cook.\n",
      "So, how do you make that determination in terms of compromising intended use?\n",
      "Is it just safety?\n",
      "Is that where you draw the line?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think it depends on the way the person wants to use the space.\n",
      "If the person has a 10 bedroom house, and 5 of these spare bedrooms are storage, the other five are usable as guest bedrooms and they only have three relatives that come and visit and there's not necessarily impairment, because they have enough bedrooms to meet their needs.\n",
      "If they have spare bedrooms but they're all--even if they have one spare bedroom but it doesn't function as a spare bedroom when they would like to have company over, then there's impairment.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, okay I've got it.\n",
      "So, it really depends on how they want to use their space and if they want to use it for so-called intended use, the intent is the patient's intent in that criteria.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, and the family intent.\n",
      "If the person is living with other people, if it's stressing the family system or the other occupants of the home, then even if the patient is saying, \"Now, we have two bathrooms but we only use one because I'm using my second one as my storage\" and the other family member is saying, \"This pisses us off cuz now everyone has to share one shower,\" then there's dysfunction and I would give that diagnosis.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm.\n",
      "And have you ever encountered something that you might call a boarder line or a subclinical case of hoarding problems or hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure, yeah, I think it's the tachometric studies that adjust it on a range of severity and you know, some people have a level of clutter that approaches compromising or somewhat compromises the living space but doesn't all the way make it unusable, so sure.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, you have to make diagnostic decisions in those cases based on how compromised the living space is.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, it's probably a range of things.\n",
      "How compromised the living space is, how much distress there is, how much impairment there is, and there might be more moderate or mild levels of distress or impairment.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. What about this criteria, it says the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that can just enclutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.\n",
      "So, I, we talked about that in our list.\n",
      "I wonder if you ever encounter situations where you feel that things like home size, so for example, somebody who lives in a very small space, like a trailer versus somebody who has the disposable income to live in a large house or have storage units.\n",
      "How does that play into determining whether their possessions can just en-clutter their active living areas.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think even people that have got lots of resources and lots of property still can end up with what looks like hoarding, even if it’s, you know, not impacting them as much as it might somebody that has limited resources.\n",
      "You know, I have people who have barns or auxiliary spaces and stuff that are filled with stuff, and, you know, maybe they are less impacted in terms of their living space, although it tends to creep in there as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like it's easier to develop or to identify hoarding disorder in somebody who has a smaller space?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t know if it is… I can think of some people that I’ve worked with who, you know, have plenty of resources and just have lots and lots of stuff in various places.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "What about substantially compromises their intended use?\n",
      "The reason I'm asking you about this is different people intend to use different spaces in different ways.\n",
      "So for example, somebody might have a guest bathroom that they use for storage.\n",
      "While that's not the intended use of the guest bathroom, they don't intend to use as a bathroom.\n",
      "You know, people kind of can make determinations or likewise, some people might really not be able to work at a desk that's fluttered, whereas other people, you know, a cluttered desk really doesn't impact them.\n",
      "Do you find that those kinds of distinctions are at play in making a diagnosis of hoarding disorder or do you find that it's very clear cut and, intended use isn’t easy?\n",
      "Interviewee: Most of time it is pretty clear that, that there are significant parts of their home, for example, that are compromised in the, in the, you know like, they can’t use the dining room table to eat at because it’s piled with stuff.\n",
      "And at least, you know, the bulk of the hoarding that I have seen, that’s, that’s the kind of situation that they’re in, it’s pretty clear.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "And, can I ask you, in your practice, how you make determinations about their living space?\n",
      "Did they just describe their living space to you, or do you have other ways of, of examining that question?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, my other really useful thing there is to, a, send a pictures and rating scale…\n",
      "Interviewer: Oh, okay yeah.\n",
      "You use their rating scale.\n",
      "Interviewee: …that, in years, you know, it, it was developed by NAME and company.\n",
      "That, I can show to people, sometimes people bring in pictures.\n",
      "25:18 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Could you describe a time where your problems with clutter got in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think I wanted to entertain and have a pleasant experience, and it was so laden with stress about that, that I didn't have a good... I didn't enjoy myself, and I really wanted to have a successful, you know, social interaction with these people, and I don't think it was all that successful.\n",
      "26:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do your problems with clutter upset any of your loved ones?\n",
      "I know you mentioned before that sometimes they just tell you to stop, and it's not as simple as that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, but he’s kind of learned not to because he doesn’t get good results when he does that.\n",
      "26:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And are you referring to your husband?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "26:26 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So I know your husband has tried.\n",
      "Has it impacted any of your relationships with other family members or your work?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Could you hold on just one second?\n",
      "26:40 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, of course.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay, I’m back.\n",
      "Other people... um well, my sister has asked for a copy of a photograph, and I can't find it, but it’s not like a major life problem, but no.\n",
      "27:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "So nothing very serious, but it has caused some minor issues.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "27:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and would you like to change your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think so, yes.\n",
      "27:23 Interviewer:\n",
      "What ways would you want to change it?\n",
      "Other than how you mentioned about organization and decreasing by about 20%, I think you said.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I feel like the reason that I'm holding on to some of these things is because I haven't faced up to certain realities, you know, in my life, and I think it would be better if I had a more clear idea about things and wasn't in the act of hiding- hiding from my life.\n",
      "So that would be a change, you know, theoretically, I would like to make, but I’m doubtful if I will ever be ready to make that, but I kind of wish I were, but I'm not sure I'm willing to do what I have to do to get that result.\n",
      "28:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so more of like a lifestyle change, if anything.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "28:22 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, our last two sections are actually focused on the pandemic that's happening right now and how its impacted you.\n",
      "So how has the COVID- 19 pandemic affected your life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Actually, you know, since I'm retired, it hasn't been great as other people.\n",
      "I do feel very stressed out when I realize that there are other citizens of this country that are endangering everybody, including themselves.\n",
      "I used to feel more safe around people in general, and now I feel like maybe 30% of the population are, you know, dangerous.\n",
      "29:17 Interviewer:\n",
      "That's understandable, and what specific behaviors have changed for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I sound like my sister is a bitty— which sometimes she is— but yeah, it’s just, whenever she talks to me about, “You need to get rid of this, you need to get rid of that,” it’s just, it’s just like I ball my fist up.\n",
      "Like, you're not going to make me get rid of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:52): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because I want this stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:55): Yeah, like you said, for you it's more about, um, the things that have value to you personally.\n",
      "So, it's understandable that it would be frustrating if someone else can't see that same value or doesn't understand why you keep these things.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:10): I know you mentioned earlier that seeing the clutter in other people's homes, like your niece’s home, was really overwhelming to you.\n",
      "So, for you, it's, it's, you know, better to have less things than to have more things, right?\n",
      "So, it's better to be—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh Lord, yes.\n",
      "I want to be able to walk in my bedroom and see nothing on the floor.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:34): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:36): And most of the reason why is just because it's overwhelming to try and tackle it all at once, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah, very overwhelming being told I have to get rid of things.\n",
      "Just, just makes my jaw lock.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:54): Right.\n",
      "So, that's especially frustrating for you, is when other people try and tell you that you need to get rid of stuff now.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:02): So, what do you consider most precious out of your belongings?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have a trio [inaudible; (34:12)].\n",
      "After four years working for [name of place; inaudible; (34:15)], I’ve got [inaudible] and I have a collection.\n",
      "They're called “[name of place].”\n",
      "It’s before the, they’ve done the final firing where they make it shiny, which is definitely not cheap to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:30): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "These things are just— oh, they’re beautiful.\n",
      "I just love them.\n",
      "But, I have been doing better because I, I, I’m now buying unique things.\n",
      "When I see a rose I’m not just buying a rose.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:33) Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It has to be something special.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:4y): So, in the past, would you say that you were definitely more liberal with what you considered, you know, valuable enough to buy?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:56): Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you think of a specific case or an example of a patient where it was challenging to diagnose them, because it was on the border between pathological and non-pathological behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, actually I can.\n",
      "I have a patient that I saw for a fair amount of time who definitely met for hoarding disorder in the sense that she had difficulty discarding or parting with some possessions.\n",
      "She definitely had this perceived need to save things and had substantial acquiring habits where she was shocked and she wasn’t [INAUDIBLE 12:49] and so it was interesting to me to treat her because for her everything truly had some sort of value—it could be used in some sort of way, and she kind of looked at things in a different light than I probably do.\n",
      "I would say that out of all the people that I’ve worked with, her home was probably, for the most part I mean, could be used completely like she could sit on her couch, they could use their kitchen, her and her husband, they could sleep on their bed.\n",
      "They did have one or two rooms that were pretty sealed in terms of clutter with things she was like collecting her art stuff and things she would buy to potentially use in the future for art-related projects that she admitted that she would never likely start.\n",
      "But for her the impairment was coming from the fact that it was causing significant problems with her and her husband, because one: she was spending money that they often times didn’t have, and two: he did not like the fact that some of the rooms were already cluttered to the point of non-use.\n",
      "But she was definitely a little bit more I guess on the fence in terms of being as severe as other people I have seen but also still technically to some degree really meeting for the disorder based on self-report.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, for you the way that you made that distinction was that you took the cue from her in terms of her self-report of impairment or her self-report of distress.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, yeah for some part some impairment was very much self-reported in the sense that I did not know personally about her finances and never interacted with her or her husband in the room in a therapy session.\n",
      "But those are things that she was reporting to me and being kind of the catalyst, you know the call for change or want to change with regard to the behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so, in terms of making the clinical distinction—even though it was kind of border line because she was self-reporting impairment—you went with her take on the situation.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I mean I knew, given what she was presenting with, that that was the kind of reel on what she would fit diagnostically and I often times think about how would I treat this patient without necessarily making a clinical decision about a disorder—particularly when it can be a little bit, you know, maybe differentially, diagnostically could be a differential diagnostic question.\n",
      "I’ll think about what are the presenting symptoms, what are maybe the underlying factors and how would I treat them; so, for her it seemed like that would be the treatment that I would use.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I just consume a lot of information, so I’m confident, you know, that I know that I have the best information and then adhering to best practices.\n",
      "I don’t know.\n",
      "That’s the only thing tahat comes to mind.\n",
      "33:55 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "No, that's great.\n",
      "And where do you seek comfort, like from your items?\n",
      "Or from others?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The dogs.\n",
      "Or doing...\n",
      "You know, especially my husband has been baking.\n",
      "So there's a lot of cooking and baking that goes on.\n",
      "There’s some remodeling in the basement that’s kind of fun to plan how we're going to arrange things and so that that's been going on.\n",
      "34:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so baking and remodeling just to keep your mind off things maybe?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "34:51 Interviewer:\n",
      "And have you sought treatment or resources or some other kind of professional support during the pandemic?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have, yes, but that's not as a result of the pandemic.\n",
      "I’ve been, you know, doing this for some time now.\n",
      "35:08 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so just other than the pandemic, you've sought out resources.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "35:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and has the pandemic affected your motivation to seek help for your problems with clutter specifically?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think there’s no difference there.\n",
      "35:30 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have the people or the person living with you changed during the pandemic or it's only been your husband, correct?\n",
      "And your dogs.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "35:50 Interviewer:\n",
      "So how have you kept in contact with family and friends during this time?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I’ve used zoom, you know, zoom meetings.\n",
      "Just the usual stuff.\n",
      "I have a sister in another city and we texted and emails and stuff like that.\n",
      "36:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever felt socially isolated or lonely prior to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "36:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "And has the pandemic affected this sense of loneliness?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "36:28 Interviewer:\n",
      "So it’s about the same then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, about the same.\n",
      "36:33 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, um, my last question is, have you ever experienced conflict during the pandemic with anyone?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, nothing notable comes to mind.\n",
      "36:53 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, well that's good to hear.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Someone came over to visit, and he didn't tell us before he got here that he’s been in another state where there was, you know, worse infection rates than where we are now, and I was annoyed with him, but I didn't like say anything to him, but I, you know, I felt an internal displeasure with the guy and I would think twice before I had him over again.\n",
      "But that's, I mean that's the extent of it.\n",
      "36:32 Interviewer:\n",
      "No, but that's understandable, especially at this time.\n",
      "You know, it's hard.\n",
      "People should be disclosing that I agree.\n",
      "So that was actually my last question of the interview, so thank you so much.\n",
      "I'm just going to ask you a couple of demographic questions.\n",
      "So what is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "38:01 Interviewer:\n",
      "Your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Interviewer (52:18): Okay, and what would you consider your race to be?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer (52:22): Okay.\n",
      "So non-Hispanic?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, non-Hispanic.\n",
      "Interviewer (52:27): Okay.\n",
      "Um, the next one is an estimate, if you can, of your household income.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, [inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (52:37): Okay.\n",
      "And the geographic region that you live in in the United States?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (52:49): Okay.\n",
      "So, the last little bit is just some information so we can send you your payment.\n",
      "It's going to be a $30 Amazon gift card.\n",
      "Um, I would recommend that you indicate an electronic gift card would be okay.\n",
      "Just because with COVID and everything right now, a physical gift card—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (53:08): Okay, so electronic.\n",
      "I'm good to write you down for that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (53:11): Okay, perfect.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (53:18): Right.\n",
      "Well, you know, you can use it for whatever you want, but definitely the electronic—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (53:30): Perfect, yeah.\n",
      "Okay, so next I just need your first and last name.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (53:42): Okay.\n",
      "And your email address.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (53:54): Alright.\n",
      "Your permanent mailing address?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (54:20): Alright.\n",
      "And country or city?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (54:35): Okay.\n",
      "And state of [state name; (54:37)].\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (54:40): And you said your zip code is [zip code]?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (54:45): Alright.\n",
      "And your phone number.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Phone number].\n",
      "Interviewer (54:53): Alright, perfect.\n",
      "Well, thank you so much for doing this interview today.\n",
      "We really appreciate it.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, thank you.\n",
      "It was a pleasure talking to you.\n",
      "Interviewer (55:06): No problem.\n",
      "All right, you have a wonderful day.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So either using the rating scale or people bringing pictures of their things.\n",
      "The final criteria I'd like to talk to you about, before we move on, is it says the difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them.\n",
      "So this is also something that came up that people sometimes are very sentimentally attached to items or they attribute emotion to that, to items.\n",
      "And I wonder how you make the determination of how much distress is normal or abnormal when it comes to discarding.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, yeah if, if you can describe the, the sentimental attachment to an object that, again, fits with my conceptualization of how people usually think about objects.\n",
      "So, you know, I got this at a particular event and it was very important to me, and therefore I want to keep it.\n",
      "You know, in the event and the object and what it represents makes it coherent description, I think that that’s a relatively normal experience.\n",
      "But if somebody says to me, well I had a picture of a cuckoo clock and I’ve lost it and I never will get over having the picture of the cuckoo clock and losing it is actually painful.\n",
      "Yeah, it’s very hard for me to understand how that represents a normal attachment to an item.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So it sounds like there's barely borderline cases for you that it's usually pretty clear cut that the attachment is extreme.\n",
      "Interviewee: Pretty much, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Now we're going to move on to talking about insight because hoarders are often described as having low insight.\n",
      "So the first thing I'd like to ask you is how you as a clinician understand the concept of insight.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think that I mean by the term insight is understanding that this particular way of dealing with things is really outside the range of what we expect in normal experience and is, in some ways, interfering with their living their lives.\n",
      "In a reasonable way, it’s causing them trouble, causing them stress, taking extraordinary amounts of time or resources.\n",
      "Things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So when patients come to you, do you find that the patients that you see often have high levels of insight already?\n",
      "Or have you seen patients that are still kind of low insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: It’s quite variable and it kind of depends on how they get here, but people who come seeking help for hoarding voluntarily usually have a reasonable amount of insight that this is a problem.\n",
      "People that are pushed into coming by family members and things like that often have extremely little insight and, you know, think it’s everybody else’s problem and that they’re just fine.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how do you in your practice help patients to try to gain insight?\n",
      "What’s your process for helping a patient with low insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I, you know, I want to talk to them about what exact things are happening.\n",
      "What restrictions are occurring because of their need to attend to these items.\n",
      "You know, can they not let people into their home because of it, can they not use things that are important to them, is it causing problems in terms of relationships because there is a big struggle with family members about the way they’re keeping things.\n",
      "Things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you help them to see the way that it has impacted their life.\n",
      "That’s what you concentrate on.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:28): And did you do so?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, in that case with the cookie cutters, I don't believe I did.\n",
      "I just did without them.\n",
      "I just did without them, and I didn't make, you know, little stars, or Christmas trees, or whatever it was that I was trying to do.\n",
      "It's been so many years, I don't remember exactly what it was.\n",
      "But it happens a lot of the times, like certain kitchen utensils.\n",
      "Or he'll say, “Hey, you have all this all these canning supplies.\n",
      "You haven’t canned in 10 years.\n",
      "Let's get rid of it.”\n",
      "And my first thought is no, because what if I want to do it again?\n",
      "Interviewer (17:02): Right.\n",
      "Okay so, do you have any sort of conflicts with your friends, or maybe like some landlords or any people that you have different relationships with?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, because my friends generally are not judgmental.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:16): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And, when I do have people come to the house, the center of the house—you know, the living room, kitchen, guest bath— those are all presentable.\n",
      "And every other room can have a door.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:32): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And that was kind of my mother's attitude when we were kids.\n",
      "She said, “You don't want to clean up your room?\n",
      "That's fine.\n",
      "I’ll just close the door.”\n",
      "Interviewer (17:42): Okay, so it sounds like there's certain areas of your house that aren't cluttered, and are presentable to, you know, a guest if they were to come over.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It will work.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:54): Right, okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "If you were to come to my house right now, you would see, you know, probably a box, or a backpack, or something sitting in the front hallway.\n",
      "I mean I have to pick up things that I wouldn't have to.\n",
      "I mean, I wouldn’t have to completely— my house, it's not like Collier’s mansion.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:17): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I mean, honestly, even the worst parts of my house does not look like an episode of Hoarders.\n",
      "13:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "So would it be valuable?\n",
      "So why would it be valuable?\n",
      "And what would happen if you were to lose it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I would be sad, it wouldn't be catastrophic, but I would think it was a shame.\n",
      "14:17 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Um, so you mentioned that you do have some parts of your house that are cluttered.\n",
      "Do you think you have too much stuff?\n",
      "And how do you know whether you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have too much stuff because there’s not a place for it, and also, I can’t find things when I’m looking for them.\n",
      "14:38 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so definitely lack of organization and places to put things in and the annoyance of not being able to find things- that's how you know.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, and to be able to get to things.\n",
      "Like in the garage, I can't open the windows because there's a boat hanging on the wall that obscures the windows and that's not my problem, because it’s not my boat, but there are things that prevent other things from being used properly because it’s too cluttered.\n",
      "15:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Is it difficult for you to walk around your house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, well the closet is the problem.\n",
      "The clothes closet... there are passageways that are obstructed in the garage, yes, but not the house.\n",
      "15:35 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would probably look at the utility.\n",
      "At the same time, if I'm using it, that would make it more likely that I would keep it.\n",
      "If something were damaged and something else were not damaged, I would keep the undamaged thing.\n",
      "I would probably look at the objective value of it.\n",
      "Like if someone were to come in and appraise it, I’d keep the thing that was of more, you know, objective value.\n",
      "That would probably be my decision making.\n",
      "16:31 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so utility and monetary value.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "16:36 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so the next section is about distinguishing hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You’re asking me?\n",
      "16:55 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, what do you think?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think that if it’s a problem then it’s disordered.\n",
      "17:06 Interviewer:\n",
      "So someone with hoarding disorder...\n",
      "I'm sorry, could you elaborate a little bit more?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I guess organization.. I’m thinking of a man I knew once that collected insects, and he had a room in his house that was filled with drawers and display cases and framed shadow boxes and you know he has thousands and thousands of insects in there.\n",
      "And the thing was not a hoarding disorder.\n",
      "It was a very extensive collection because if you asked him for whatever, he could go right to the drawer and show it to you.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like, first of all it sounds like, it’s pretty rare for you to find anybody who is on the borderline between normal saving behavior and hoarding and that really the distinction that you struggle to make when you do struggle to make a distinction is between hoarding and other potential problems.\n",
      "I wonder if you could talk me through the process of making that distinction when it’s tough.\n",
      "How do you decide if a diagnosis of hoarding or a diagnosis of OCD, for example, is a primary diagnosis?\n",
      "Interviewee: So I think that probably the one thing that’s most crucial is reason for saving.\n",
      "So like when we talked about motivation for saving before.\n",
      "So with the patients, and this is a pretty small number from the studies and in my experience too, patients who actually have clutter in their home but it’s really secondary to OCD, it’s very easy to figure that out.\n",
      "You ask them, “Why do you have these bags of garbage sitting in your living room?” and they say, “Because I’m afraid if I throw them out, they’re contaminated, and the garbage man that picks them up is going to catch a disease or something, so I don’t want to throw them out because of that” or they might say there might be some of their valuable thing inside there that they have to check through one more time before they throw them out.\n",
      "But usually it’s pretty easy to figure out the reason for saving is because of some other typical obsessional concern that’s much more consistent with OCD as opposed to the typical things we see with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "They might need it someday, what if I need it someday and I don’t have it, it’s valuable, I paid good money for it, I’m saving it up to give as a gift to someone, it’s memorabilia, it’s stuff from when my kids were in grade school and they drew me a picture and now my kid is thirty-years-old, but I can’t bear to part with that picture they drew in grade school.\n",
      "So the reasons for saving are completely different as compared to OCD.\n",
      "As I said with depression and ADHD, even though yes they’re also highly comorbid with hoarding disorder, but I do see occasional patients where it clearly seems like the clutter is almost entirely secondary to the ADHD or depression.\n",
      "Prior to the onset of the depressive episode, let’s say they never really had problems with clutter.\n",
      "Maybe they had mild subclinical difficulty discarding, but it was never really a problem until they had that physical disability or major depression or something like that.\n",
      "And again, usually in those cases there isn’t that strong drive to save it’s just more difficulty taking care of things and having the mental and physical energy needed to clean up.\n",
      "And with the ADHD, same thing, the reason for saving, usually the person doesn’t want to have that clutter, they just haven’t gotten around or are unable to organize their time to be able to take care of their environment and put everything away.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It's not like it's a fire— you know, I don't look at anything in my house that would be a fire hazard, or a way that I wasn't able to get out in an emergency.\n",
      "I'm not going to trip over stuff.\n",
      "It's not like that.\n",
      "It's just, you know, too much stuff in too small of a space.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:00): Okay.\n",
      "So, what would you say is the most cluttered area of your house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, the one that causes me the most stress would be my bedroom.\n",
      "But the most cluttered space in my house is probably my craft room.\n",
      "And I don't have, like I said, I don't have a very big house.\n",
      "It's got, you know, two small bedrooms and a master.\n",
      "Um, a living room, no dining room, an eat-in kitchen, and that's it.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:38): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, I would have to probably say the craft room would be the most cluttered.\n",
      "Um, there have been times in that craft room when there was no floor space to work, to walk.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:52): Gotcha.\n",
      "And—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And I have remedied that, and my intent is to keep it that way.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:59): And is there any sort of organization to the clutter?\n",
      "Or is it just kind of, you know, things stacked on top of each other, stuff on the floor.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Kind of both.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:09): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Kind of both.\n",
      "I mean, there is some, there is some organization to it, because I do have, like I said, I have bins.\n",
      "I have a bin with yarn in it.\n",
      "I have a bin with fiber in it, and those things like that.\n",
      "And then, there are other things that I'm still like looking at going, what do I do with this?\n",
      "You know, do I get rid of it?\n",
      "Do I keep it?\n",
      "Do I give it away?\n",
      "You know, it's old electronics, you know.\n",
      "But you just hate, I hate to throw things into a landfill.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:42): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, and then that’s another issue that I have.\n",
      "You know, I've got old electronics, and they should be being recycled, and— yeah.\n",
      "I mean, it's, it's stuff like that.\n",
      "But, you know, again, as I'm cleaning, those things are in a disorganized pile.\n",
      "They may be sitting in a pile in front of a, you know, in front of the bookcase, because I throw them all there because I don’t know what to do with them.\n",
      "And now I have to get back into it and start figuring out what do I do with it.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:14): How often do you, would you say that you, go through your things in an attempt to throw things away?\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s interesting, so she kind of saw hoarding as a self-protective, almost like a creation of a shell or a safe space?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes!\n",
      "Yes, that’s a great way to put it, like a shell or a safe place.\n",
      "And also she derived a lot of pleasure from it and obviously being someone who had been traumatized, she wanted to have a pleasurable experience and acquiring was one way in which she could do that.\n",
      "For some of the other patients, I have another patient that I saw for a while—I’ve never seen a more clear-cut case of actual cognitive deficit in a patient that may have led to hoarding as well as kind of impulsivity, and so it’s kind of different to see these different kinds of cases and how they manifested and what maybe led to their hoarding.\n",
      "For her, it was definitely like, she, I gave her a sorting task once and it took her like 12 minutes to sort 20 items that were clearly could be sorted in two minutes, and it was these five categories like newspapers, magazines, toiletry items, clothing items, that kind of thing, and she had significant difficulty attending, just making decisions about where things should go, wanting to kind of be right about a decision.\n",
      "Her hoarding seemed to stem a lot from this kind of problem as well as this kind of pleasure that would derive from her acquiring things and thinking like, “I may be able to use this thing in the future” or “this was given to me by someone”.\n",
      "She had every mardi gras cup she had ever collected every time she had been to mardi gras, and as a person who also saves a couple of mardi gras cups to kind of have for nostalgia reasons, I would never keep every single one.\n",
      "And for her if she got rid of one cup it truly meant that she had gotten rid of every single memory for her if she got rid of all of them at once.\n",
      "Interviewer: That kind of brings me to the next question really nicely, which is, again this might be different for different patients or it might be very difficult to say but, do you think that the explanations that people give to justify their hoarding behavior are post hoc justifications for an underlying pathological need?\n",
      "Do you think that the cognition justifies something that’s going on in the brain and is justifying it, or do you think that the justifications are actually what’s causing the behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: Gosh, that’s a very good question.\n",
      "To be honest, I think it’s both.\n",
      "I think that you could have—I mean when I think of other kind of like underlying cognitive mechanisms and factors just with any disorder, even with PTSD, having this bias that the world may be a dangerous place to be something that I kind of have early on, but then these experiences that I have reinforce that belief.\n",
      "And so I think that for hoarders it could be a little bit of both, maybe like there are some beliefs that they have that are them for some reason reinforced by these experiences and then they’re also post hoc reasons as to why they’re doing it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I agree that it’s a very difficult question to answer and it’s been very interesting.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, the questions you’re asking are so fascinating.\n",
      "Interviewer: I think it could be used for either.\n",
      "So either like you’re about to start; you’re getting some information or do you have a thought on when that would be useful?\n",
      "Like would it be more useful as kind of like when you’re looking?\n",
      "This kind of gives you some basic information or as you’re about to start therapy this would be helpful for…\n",
      "Speaker: I tend to be a little bit more of a researcher so if it were something I could see or play ahead of time.\n",
      "(48:19)\n",
      ".\n",
      "In that case I guess it could be a little bit of both or it could be separate.\n",
      "Parents seeking or adults seeking, or for children.\n",
      "I probably would have watched both and then if I felt like something I would have shown my child the child one because she was already so anxious to begin with, so going into a new situation and meeting someone new for her was already kind of unsettling.\n",
      "Just to kid of give a friendly face or a light hearted face to it could be beneficial.\n",
      "Interviewer: When you say “quick” can you give me a timeframe like if it under this amount of time.\n",
      "Speaker: Under three minutes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "That was helpful because different people have different definitions of “quick” so that’s probably what mine would be as well.\n",
      "Speaker: And that’s a pretty long time these days because everybody swipes and clicks and is used to controlling everything like really like ten seconds.\n",
      "I mean I could usually tell during the first thirty seconds of a lesson like they’re not with me.\n",
      "Same thing public speaking like if you don’t have them in the first minute or two like people are already starting to whip out their phones and they’re gone.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Makes sense.\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "Things keep getting shorter and shorter it seems like.\n",
      "So now we’ve said who’s in it.\n",
      "Now we have to decide where they’re gonna talk.\n",
      "So like would it be at home, school, doctors office, somewhere outside?\n",
      "None of the above?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know.\n",
      "Any of those places I think would be okay.\n",
      "I don’t think where is as important like what like just to present your information.\n",
      "I would keep it simple.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like the content, to you, is more important than the location.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah as an adult, the bullet points I would be looking for the bullet points.\n",
      "The kids aren’t; well depending on their age, but that’s usually not, they like points not bullet points.\n",
      "They want tokens or points.\n",
      "“The next level” I don’t know, level up; they’re so into that kind of stuff.\n",
      "I mean it seems natural that [the location] would be in an office.\n",
      "I always feel like when we come in here its pediatric so it’s more kid friendly and there are small things for small people and the kids always notice that.\n",
      "If it’s child friendly, we don’t notice that as much as adults because we are used to everything being our size but like I’m in a child environment all the time so when an adult comes in they’re like “I sit down here?” I mean I promise it will hold you but its low to the ground everything is low to the ground so it’s interesting when you go into an adult’s doctor’s office versus a kids office they notice that stuff and they know it’s for them don’t even ask if they can touch it.\n",
      "Interviewer: I never really thought about that.\n",
      "Speaker: It’s not crazy it totally makes sense.\n",
      "Until you start observing that stuff I never would have thought about it.\n",
      "Right away if I don’t want my kids to touch something then this is the level, like if it’s up here or higher they won’t mess with it usually without permission.\n",
      "But anything that’s down here they think it’s their stuff.\n",
      "Anything that’s on the coffee table they’ll mess with it.\n",
      "I you don’t want them to mess with it put it up here.\n",
      "It’s not just toddlers it’s like my teens are the same way.\n",
      "53:10-Transcribed by Aqueena\n",
      "Interviewer: So you talked about that being the first thing and so I’m guessing after that came the recommendation for therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes and then we were told because there were- I was like is this going to be talk therapy where we come in and talk about our feelings type thing?\n",
      "Is that, you know, what’s going on and that’s when we were kind of given a sort of what I felt like was a little bit of a brief overview.\n",
      "We were told about the fear hierarchy or whatever it was and we were talking and we- once there was a diagnosis of… at first it was generalized anxiety and OCD and so I didn’t even understand really what OCD was at the time.\n",
      "So I just had thought that it was a physical manifestation only that it was habitual habits that you would be acting out kind of that maybe you had to have a thought process that went with it but I always felt like it had some sort of recognizable physical representation as well.\n",
      "Then getting, just on our first meeting, talking about no it can even just be a thought process it doesn’t ever even have to be animated.\n",
      "There is no kind of thing to that and understanding what that was put it into perspective for me to all of a sudden go oh you can get kind of caught in a loop of just thoughts that prevent you from carrying life on comfortably type thing.\n",
      "So then it was explained to us and she I remember gave us a little diagram that showed two rainbows and something I don’t even remember but talking about that it was basically kind of like an exposure where were going to rate things- your comfort level on things and addressing and things we had already realized, patterns that brought us in in the first place.\n",
      "Reaching out for help was because recognizing that there was these certain things that kept popping up and… so it was like yeah let’s just start addressing those things and as we worked through those things realizing, you know, it was pretty cool just prioritizing, you know, what you wanted to work with first and really had quick results with- at the time I think my daughter was in 5th grade?\n",
      "4th grade?\n",
      "It was like 4 years ago.\n",
      "Talking about the dedication that it would take to know that there were a couple paths we could do.\n",
      "You know, Ideally It would be fairly quick and regular but it didn’t- I will just say working with children in the 9-5 to 9-4 window and wanting to work with them every day or every other day was kind of overwhelming as a parent because that interrupts their regular education and lifestyle and stuff.\n",
      "So we ended up trying to find a way to do both things kind of and so- which presented like it’s kind of going to be longer, we’re going to have to work at this longer type thing but the results happens so quickly and that was really helpful too because it’s kind of heartbreaking as a parent to want to help your child but knowing we can’t come here every day and spend the first two hours- 9-11, you’re going to miss so much school.\n",
      "That kind of thing but with the actual thing, our experience anyway with the actual- what I love is that it was giving her tools and it was- she could practice things outside of therapy as well that continued to help her benefit, you know, even outside of the actual sessions that we were having.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But I have a price tag on things too.\n",
      "The most I ever spent for a piece was like thirty dollars, but a lot of my stuff is five, ten, you know, because I’m very particular.\n",
      "So, now that now, and uh, there’s another thing I just started and [laughing] well, I have my cups and saucers, the regular size.\n",
      "Then, I have what they call “demies,” which is the small one.\n",
      "Well, I’ve seen something new I kinda like where it comes with a saucer, you know the saucer for your, your cup, but it’s a plate too!\n",
      "There’s a little place on it where the cup fits.\n",
      "And, so now, I’ve been on a hunt, like, to find more of those kinds of pieces.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:38): Okay, so, we can see you kind of go through stages of like what you like to collect?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Exactly, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:46): Okay.\n",
      "So, now it's, you know, the cups in the saucers with the plates.\n",
      "Do you remember, in particular, something from your past that you really like to collect, other than the purses and the wallets?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, let me see… I’ve never been a show freak.\n",
      "When I was married to my first husband for twenty-five years, only had two pairs of shoes to my name.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:15): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And the shoes were not something.\n",
      "Um, let me see… I would, I’d I have to go back to wallets, you know, because I like them.\n",
      "If I can find something real nice and not pay a lot of money for it, that's like a price to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:30): Right.\n",
      "Yeah, I understand.\n",
      "So, you know with, um, with your ex-husband that you mentioned, did he have a lot of stuff, or was he very minimal in terms of the stuff he had?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think he was pretty minimal, you know.\n",
      "He had a desk in one room, and then he had his article of clothes in another room.\n",
      "So, he was pretty, you know he's very organized, yep.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:58): Okay.\n",
      "And, so, his organization and you know, your tendency to collect things, that kind of, you know, definitely caused some issues between you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, no. Because I couldn’t bring anything in the house.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:10): Right.\n",
      "Okay, so, in what way did he prevent you from bringing things into the house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, when I first, you know, we got married and everything, and I, you know, I want to bring in some of my things, you know, because I had these beautiful wooden bookcases with glass doors on them.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:27): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, he didn't want them.\n",
      "He didn’t want those in.\n",
      "I couldn’t even bring in pictures of my family or grandchildren.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:35): Wow.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because it just didn't feel like it was my space to do anything with.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:40): Alright, and because of that, where did you end up keeping this stuff?\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, do you find that people are like frankly psychotic very often?\n",
      "Like they are caught hearing voices?\n",
      "Interviewee: It’s a very vocal delusion is all I can say.\n",
      "When it does occur, often times these are individuals who are able to plan and execute very complex strategies to maintain their behavior.\n",
      "So, you certainly wouldn’t put them into the psychotic category, I don’t think.\n",
      "But when it comes to specific outcome of their behavior, the consequences, they seem to be able to just (INAUDIBLE 46:22) that out and draw a blank.\n",
      "You have to be very high functioning.\n",
      "You know, we’ve had people that are, there’s been mental health professionals, famous stories of psychologists and psychiatrists who have been hoarders.\n",
      "How do you (INAUDIBLE 46:37) that one out?\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s like a total blindspot about this one–\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean there was (NAME 46:43) and (NAME 46:44) and their book (NAME 46:45) about a woman who was a psychiatrist in New York and she was a cat hoarder and she used to make her patients work with her cats as part of their therapy and she would encourage the patient to go home and collect their own population of cats.\n",
      "Interviewer: Wow, that’s a whole new problem.\n",
      "That’s a whole new level of problems of insight.\n",
      "Well, I really appreciate your time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you ever had to take animals from the same person multiple times?\n",
      "Interviewee: Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, they just kind of move around and accumulate and get busted and move around and accumulate.\n",
      "What about on the other end temporarily?\n",
      "Do you have any idea with the people that you encounter how long it’s been going on or when it started?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s sort of a (INAUDIBLE 18:36) question because all of our research is really from cross-sectional information at the time of the case, so we don’t have a longitudinal.\n",
      "A longitudinal is very hard to get.\n",
      "Where we do have some insight to that is from some conversation with family members.\n",
      "So you’ll talk to a child, and the child will say, or an adult child will say, “Oh yeah my mother started this fifteen years ago and it drove my father away or my father died and my mother started this.\n",
      "We’ve tried everything.”\n",
      "(INAUDIBLE 19:10-19:16) Often what they would do is recount some traumatic event that seemed to precipitate.\n",
      "Sometimes the person themselves because often times they are quite talkative and they do want to share especially if they talk about their animals (INAUDIBLE 19:31) in their lives.\n",
      "Often times they would volunteer to speak.\n",
      "It’s really hard to know how much of it was true and how much of it wasn’t.\n",
      "Speaker: With the exception of you know encouraging someone to be patient and work through the system.\n",
      "Again I think my circumstances coming into it was more of a panic of not knowing what to do and wanting, and having the faults of always wanting to fix things, and knowing that something can’t be fixed overnight.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Try and think of three words that describe how you felt about CBT when you first learned about it.\n",
      "Um and what would those words be, it’s kind of a hard question but.\n",
      "Speaker: Let’s see, CBT, first just thinking about it would be, I would say, challenging.\n",
      "Um I would even say somewhat overwhelming because it’s just a different mindset which you’re not really familiar with what to do and to get sometimes when you work with CBT, a particular area it might be a very wide depth of personal time for physical stuff, whatever you have to do that part of it so, challenging, overwhelming, and I would say um also uplifting that there’s an option that kids can do to help themselves.\n",
      "If they learn the tools of the CBT that they will always be able to instigate them when they need them and be able to move up and say that’s just another challenge that they are able or have the ability to go “this is just what I do.”\n",
      "Our kids started at four, our daughter started at four and our son started at about seven, so it just like in our household it’s like it’s just another challenge; it’s just another thing we gotta do, and use your CBT to figure out where we’re gonna combat this.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Speaker: Um, I would start with hope.\n",
      "There’s something that could address what the issue is, um introspection.\n",
      "Yeah I feel like both my wife and I and our child had to think about our behaviors and why we are doing the behaviors we are doing at home and how they are contributing to my daughter’s behavior.\n",
      "And um discipline, that um you got to learn to do your exercises or your process over and over again whether you need it or not at that very particular period of time\n",
      "Interviewer:Right\n",
      "Speaker: So um, discipline to um do the behavior\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Are there any pictures that come to mind when you think of those words or CBT?\n",
      "Speaker1 – To me just from being in therapy so much all the time with the children, I think of holding hands or a hand reaching out to grab another hand because it’s like your giving a tool, a way of lie, a way to combat something that can be overwhelming, so somebody’s helping you, helping hand to lift you up and get you to that next step.\n",
      "Speaker: I like that, that’s good.\n",
      "Um, I would also, um think I mean one of things that my daughter has said you know coming here has helped her is that she said she doesn’t feel alone and that she has um you know a realization now that um other kids that she might not know is going through the same thing and that there is someone here that can listen and help her and stuff like that so, um I don’t know if that’s a picture but like not being alone.\n",
      "So however you might want to display that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, so the goal of CBT is to reduce anxiety.\n",
      "If someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life what would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: I would say anxiety would become a problem in your life if it affects, interferes with your normal, daily, ritual, routine lifestyle.\n",
      "If it becomes that anxiety is the bigger beast in the day versus your normal chores, life, day that’s where CBT can come in ad go “let’s stop that and eliminate it and get you back to kind of a normal level of ups and downs” Everyone has ups and downs, you’re always going to but CBT helps you bring down the anxiety and get you on an even keel so you just deal with normal life.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so, kind of to think through that as kind of a life course of an illness, that’s kind of a really long time to have something like hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Is your sense of it that its worsens with age, is it more that they just accumulate items and it becomes more and more impairing?\n",
      "How does it progress or how does it change over the course of a patient’s life?\n",
      "Interviewee: Good questions.\n",
      "The short answer is I don’t know.\n",
      "The longer answer is we’ve got some guesses, one is I think there is a certain level of this behavior that worsens with age.\n",
      "I think that as you age it becomes for some people I think their brains may age at an accelerated rate and it becomes difficult for them to employ executive functions.\n",
      "I think for some people, and these aren’t mutually exclusive, it takes a long time to build up clutter till it reaches some sort of terminal point.\n",
      "But I also think a lot of it is that as you age you have fewer and fewer people to help you keep your behavior in line.\n",
      "So, I suspect that one of the reasons that we tend not to see a whole lot of child clinical cases even though behavior probably starts at childhood is because you have parents that are constantly on you to clean up your room or they’re cleaning it up themselves.\n",
      "And then when you move out of your parents’ house and you get married and you have a spouse who’s on you and helps you to take care of it.\n",
      "But you know I think what you tend to see is that these problems worsen as you have fewer and fewer exterior supports.\n",
      "So, when you no longer have your parents in the house, when you no longer have a spouse in the house, when you no longer have adults, when you no longer have your children in the house I think what we see is a behavior begins to spike following those kinds of absences.\n",
      "So, you have fewer people putting on the brakes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, so there is maybe a progressive aspect but also a social aspect and as your social life changes over your life course the manifestation of your disorder might worsen.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think so, and there’s an environmental aspect, which is just that it takes a long time for the stuff to reach a critical mass.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "For the final kind of part of the interview we are doing, we are almost done so I want to be respectful of your time.\n",
      "We are just going to talk about some of the explanations that patients with hoarding disorder have for their behavior and this is a little bit of a difficult set of questions because we are asking you to think about what your patients think or what your patients say?\n",
      "And the purpose of this is when we do our patient interviews to compare clinicians’ ideas about what their patients are thinking to what the patients actually respond.\n",
      "So, these are kind of adapted from the brown assessment of belief scale.\n",
      "Interview 012\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Well great I will go ahead and explain what we are doing and give you our little informed consent spiel and answer any questions you have.\n",
      "And then we can go ahead and get started with the interview because I don’t want to take up too much of your time.\n",
      "The purpose of the project is to kind of get a feeling for the general state of knowledge about hording disorder at this time, so what we are doing is interviewing clinical experts in hording disorder using a snowball sampling methodology.\n",
      "So, we are getting people to refer us to other people who they think are key experts so that’s how we got your name.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay\n",
      "Interviewer: And we are asking them questions just to help us think through some of the critical issues surrounding the diagnosis of hording disorder what constitutes hording disorder.\n",
      "I think that they are interesting questions for clinicians.\n",
      "We have had good feedback so far, in terms of the kind of things we are asking.\n",
      "We are interested in exploring questions like insight in hording disorders, so how patients come to understand that they have a disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so, in order to do that we first trying to understand how clinicians come to understand that their patients have a disorder.\n",
      "So, the questions are all centered around how you as the clinician know someone has this disorder, what makes it different from normal behavior, where the dividing line is.\n",
      "The next step of the project is we are going to be interviewing patients to see how they answer very similar questions to see if there are similarities or disjuncts in the ways that patients and physicians think about things.\n",
      "And if that can be useful in helping patients come to treatment earlier and dealing with the problem in sight.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: So that’s the idea behind our project.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sounds interesting.\n",
      "Interviewer: I don’t know if you have any questions for me right of the bat.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I don’t think so.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Well, so I will give you two sentences about me.\n",
      "I am a graduate student in anthropology actually not in psychology or psychiatry, although I am a M.D. Ph.D.\n",
      "So, I kind of got pulled into this with a colleague of mine who is getting his Ph.D. in Dr. Carl Mathews lab, and we started talking about this project.\n",
      "So, we are going to be using mostly qualitative methodology, so we are going to be doing a semi-structured interview.\n",
      "We are also going to be using a technique called free listing, which is an interesting technique where we ask people to kind of generate lists of things of the top of their head.\n",
      "And the idea there is to be able to compare statistically the sorts of things that end up on the lists of different kinds of people.\n",
      "So, we are going to be comparing this lists that clinicians generate with the lists that patients generate to see if there are significant differences in the way that people think about things.\n",
      "So that’s what we are going to be doing today.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Stop me if I am going to fast or if you have any questions.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, you are fine.\n",
      "Speaker: I’ve always looked at it as a three step process of your thinking, your feelings, your behavior and you try to make somebody aware of their behavior and their feelings that they had when they had those behaviors, and the thoughts that cause those feelings.\n",
      "And then you try to get them to change their thoughts so they can change their feelings, then change their behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: And um, you know, when you guys first came here and were learning about what kind of therapy we do here, do you remember what questions you had or maybe what you were feeling or thinking at that point about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Well, I mean, the time table would be one you know, what is the length of time, they think, my daughter would need to go through the therapy.\n",
      "That was my biggest question.\n",
      "And I know that with um, when you have the need for CBT.\n",
      "I that it?\n",
      "That for some people it’s a lifetime commitment to changing those behaviors and stuff.\n",
      "But, I wasn’t sure how long the therapy lasts for.\n",
      "That was one of the biggest questions I had, still don’t know the answer to that.\n",
      "Interview: Yeah that’s a good question, yeah.\n",
      "Any other questions that you guys had coming in?\n",
      "Speaker: For me, it’s different, I’ve been exposed to CBT since, our daughter is 12, so basically since she was 4.\n",
      "So I’ve had a long process and experience with dealing with CBT.\n",
      "Um, in the very beginning I would say mostly it’s like, what do you expect of how long to, you can’t predict changes but how long do you say we do this certain area of CBT before we either increase the difficulty or you say let’s put that on the backburner and tackle this instead.\n",
      "So to me it’s like a stair system of how well you progress and how much you need to push further to progress further, because to me CBT is a stepping process of challenging yourself to be a little bit pushed to the edge so that you can reprogram to be challenged again, to go further so that you can be, get to the place that you’re trying to get to.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like you know.\n",
      "Sorry\n",
      "Speaker: I just wanted to say, you I was trying to recall, you know how I was feeling with it, my daughter’s need for therapy rose, I think, fairly quickly and sense of panic, I think, on our part sort of not understanding how it kicked in for her and this feeling of a little bit of helplessness and um trying to deal with it on our own, which is why we reached out for help obviously, but I had a little bit of a sense of panic, on my part, of wanting to be able to help my daughter and not understanding why it kicked in for her.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, that she’s listening to you describe her and she’s not seeing it.\n",
      "Interviewee: And she came up and she chatted with me and I didn’t know who she was until after the fact somebody came up to me, a law enforcement agent came up and said, “I don’t know if you know this or not, but that was so-and-so and you know this is who she is” and I was like “Wow, I never would’ve known it.”\n",
      "Interviewer: What do these people’s kind of place in society like do they tend to have family, do they tend to be employed, do they tend to otherwise have normal lives?\n",
      "Again, I know this is a generalization I’m asking for.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, the initial work we did and I think it has held up that they (INAUDIBLE 43:13).\n",
      "They tend to be older, living alone, and just socio-economically marginalised.\n",
      "But then you can flip that around and find an example and here’s a person who comes from a wealthy family and you see some that are married with kids.\n",
      "But that’s the exception, not the rule.\n",
      "The rule tends to be that these are people who are living relatively solitary kind of hard to (INAUDIBLE 43:47) lives.\n",
      "Now the flip side is, if you Google it, you will see which is a very big case up in New Hampshire or Maine, one of the two I can’t remember which now, and there was a very wealthy woman who was hoarding great danes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Wow.\n",
      "Interviewee: And she’s been in litigation now with the (NAME 44:07) and the local community and she’s got the means to be a very pretentious (INAUDIBLE 44:13).\n",
      "Interviewer: That is so interesting.\n",
      "Interviewee: There’s somebody who sort of, she doesn’t challenge the (INAUDIBLE 44:18) type, but she challenges a few of the others.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right and then there’s that kind of correlation-causation problem where it’s like are they older and living alone and relatively impoverished because they are animal hoarders because those are they people who are able to become animal hoarders it makes them impoverished, it makes them live alone?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a very good point, (NAME 44:37).\n",
      "I think we don’t know that either.\n",
      "We don’t have the longitudinal information.\n",
      "It’s certainly not a path to wealth and happiness.\n",
      "No one would make a recommendation (INAUDIBLE 44:53).\n",
      "Interviewer: Dang, I’ll have to cross that off my life plan: animal hoarding.\n",
      "Well this is kind of my last question and then I’d like to talk to you about next steps because this is extremely fascinating and I’m so glad that we had this conversation.\n",
      "So, what do you think about the relationship between this phenomena and other potential psychiatric or psychological problems, like we talked about trauma.\n",
      "But do people tend to be depressed?\n",
      "Do you see this as a behavior of a depressed person who can’t really control their life and is perhaps trying to cope with depression?\n",
      "Interviewee: I wouldn’t be qualified to make, I’m certainly not qualified by myself to make that judgement and we really don’t have the data because nobody has done clinical diagnostics on these samples.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s ok because that’s three words.\n",
      "Yeah that works.\n",
      "So for each of those words if you had to add a picture to them calmness, reframing, mindfulness, or being in the moment what would they look like?\n",
      "Speaker: I would think that would differ for each person.\n",
      "For me it would be a safe place somewhere where didn’t feel threatened.\n",
      "For me it’s beside like the side of a small river where there is water coming down or you can hear the trickling of water and um just having a nice temperature and a little bit of sun in your face.\n",
      "Just peacefulness and just the lack of threat.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what about for reframing.\n",
      "What would that look like?\n",
      "Speaker: So reframing would be like I have a memory of an event that happened and I think of it almost has my… it’s complicated but I. Um so reframing would be me having my opinion about based on limited information at the time when I was a child and having the therapist or the psychologist ask me what would have happened if my mom had taken me somewhere else..\n",
      "Um...\n",
      "What would have happened if there… what other outcome could have occurred?\n",
      "Interviewer: So kind of like presenting a hypothetical.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah yeah and it makes you go back.\n",
      "So I relive these things every time I talk about them unfortunately.\n",
      "So um there was this time in sixth grade where my mom who is schizophrenic and bipolar.\n",
      "My parents got divorced in third grade so my mom... so I was living alone with my mom and my brother and sister lived with my dad.\n",
      "So the situation was my mom wanted to know what I thought about moving to Canada.\n",
      "We were living in Colorado and it scared me enough somehow that I contacted my brother and sister who were living with my dad and within that week custody changed from me being with my mom to me being with my dad.\n",
      "So I felt guilty for so many years for most of my life that I left mom when I promised her that I wouldn’t.\n",
      "So in cognitive behavior therapy the question posed to me was what would have happened if you had stayed with your mom?\n",
      "So I had to think.\n",
      "Well we could have ended up homeless.\n",
      "We could have… oh and so a result of me leaving also was that she got hospitalized.\n",
      "So in the scheme of things it had a good outcome, although for the longest time I felt bad.\n",
      "It made me reconsider so that I didn’t need to feel the guilt and the shame um that I had and that it was ok the way it turned out and um…\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so would you say maybe a picture that could be associated with the reframing would be someone sitting with a therapist or someone [16:10] ___ showing support or\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, showing support um helping them to realize that there is more than one choice.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah ok awesome.\n",
      "So the goal of CBT many times is to reduce anxiety, so if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in one’s life what would you say it looks like?\n",
      "Speaker: Um having lived with it all of my life it is a little hard to say but anxiety would be someone talking to fast or doing too many things and not necessarily doing them well or not finishing them.\n",
      "Anxiety is that knot in your stomach or in your chest that makes you feel like your heart is going to explode.\n",
      "It’s your mind racing with thoughts so fast that you can’t calm down.\n",
      "I had that just this morning so.\n",
      "Um and you just have to stop what you’re doing, realize that you are out of control.\n",
      "Sort of somehow get yourself distracted or change what you are doing to something that is healthier and get out of that mind frame.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah and um what’s important for other patients to know?\n",
      "Speaker: About\n",
      "Interviewer: About\n",
      "Speaker: anxiety\n",
      "Interviewer: The interview tends to take about 60 minutes.\n",
      "If you don’t have 60 minutes rights now we can stop at any time.\n",
      "I will go ahead and read you the informed consent and you can let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything that I can clarify.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sounds cool.\n",
      "Let’s just do it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So, I will just go through the informed consent really fast and let me know.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So, you are volunteering to participate in a research project conducted by Carl Mathews from the University of Florida.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer: The aim of this study is to better understand the ways that researchers and clinicians think about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "You will be one of approximately one of 50 people who are being interviewed for this research.\n",
      "Your participation is of course voluntary and you will not be paid.\n",
      "There are no direct benefits to you in participating and the biggest risk is a violation of your confidentiality.\n",
      "You can withdraw and discontinue participation without any penalty.\n",
      "If you decline to participate or withdraw there will be no consequences and no one will be told.\n",
      "[inaudible 03:51] Most interviewees find the discussion interesting and thought provoking but if you feel uncomfortable in any way during the interview session you have the right to decline to answer any questions or to end the interview.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Participation in this study involves being interviewed by us researchers from the University of Florida.\n",
      "We are thinking the interview will last about 60 minutes and we are going to take notes and audio record the interview.\n",
      "After the interview, a transcription will be made of the audio recording so if you do not want to be recorded you will not be able to participate in this study.\n",
      "The recording will then be transcribed and all information that could identify you will be removed from the transcription and then will we destroyed the audio recording.\n",
      "We will also not identify you by name in any reports, your confidentiality as a participant will remain secure, and obviously subsequent use of records of data will be subject to standard data use policies, which protect the anonymity of individuals and institutions.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Faculty and administrators from my campus will not be present at the interview and will not have access to notes or transcripts.\n",
      "And we are hoping that this will prevent your individual comments from having any negative repercussions.\n",
      "We have IRB approval from our institutional review board at the University of Florida and I can send you contact information for Dr. Mathews who is the PI on this study or the IRB if you would like that at any time.\n",
      "Okay?\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: All sound good?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer: Any questions?\n",
      "Interviewee: Nope.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, perfect.\n",
      "So those are all the listing exercises that we have.\n",
      "Now we are going to move into more of a semi-structured interview, so it’s going to be more conversational.\n",
      "Tollin: That’s fine.\n",
      "Interviewer: So just to begin, if you wouldn’t mind briefly telling me your background related to hoarding disorder and how you are involved in either research or patient care.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Well I conduct research on the topic of hoarding disorder, in particular I conduct research on both the neurobiology of hoarding disorder as well as the cognitive behavioral treatment of hoarding.\n",
      "I also oversee… [inaudible 11:19-11:20]\n",
      "Interviewer: Hello, did I lose you?\n",
      "Interviewee: [inaudible 11:22-11:30]\n",
      "Interviewer: Hello?\n",
      "Hello, I think I lost you for a second there.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Interview- Any other questions or anything you wanted to add on to that point?\n",
      "Speaker: For me, about CBT itself is that, um my husband and myself practice it as well so for us we didn’t have the quite “what’s going on?” the unfamiliarity with it.\n",
      "So it was more of a process of, so now we start our child into getting to the step, so for me I had uh big um, I already had my feet in the water of the pool, I knew what it was kind of about, but it is, it can be overwhelming to figure out where your starting place is.\n",
      "To feel like what’s the thing you need to like put your little finger in first to like, to have a jumping off point.\n",
      "And sometimes, sometimes you have to pick and choose where you start that point too.\n",
      "For the difficulty of the person, for the child that’s going through it they may not be able to handle that and we have always done like a fear hierarchy which help you a basis of what the um the things you need to work on.\n",
      "I think that helped a lot with designing the CBT to then know where your increments are to have to, you can push you enough, this is not too much but it pushes you enough to get to be at a more stable place of um… you know a focused place of that you’ve at a stepping stone point to step off and go now I can breathe for a second and think “where is my next place I gotta jump off and work and hurdle and kind of get over.”\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Um, so was there anything really quick off that question is there anything that when you came into therapy you really wanted to know about CBT?\n",
      "It’s sort of a similar question but\n",
      "Speaker: Um, I don’t, initially for CBT I guess we wanted to know what, um what kinda the prognosis is, what like does everyone like, you know, succeed and flourish under doing CBT or is it only certain types of personalities or types of challenges you have.\n",
      "So, we kind of wanted to know, as CBT as a option, it is for everybody kind of thing?\n",
      "Or is it just like certain people who have certain kind of things have certain challenges, is it just for them.\n",
      "So that was kind of well maybe a curve that we wanted to know or really unfamiliar to know what type people or does everybody you know like is everybody getting the flu shot or not you know\n",
      "Interviewer: right exactly\n",
      "Speaker: so that was something we thought about in the beginning.\n",
      "Interviewer: Absolutely\n",
      "Speaker:\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, How much did you guys know about CBT from things like movies or tv, the internet, or just other people.\n",
      "Um like how had you heard about it in the media or stuff like that.\n",
      "Speaker: Not very much.\n",
      "I’ve seen more movies or information more about the conditions of people who have like problem and need help but, the focus on like a CBT-type solution I don’t think has been really out there much as far as the movie industry and newspaper articles and such.\n",
      "I think now it is being more of a go to thing for doctors and for people thinking of it and so it is coming out why you are making the video people are turning to it more than people in the past.\n",
      "Well this person has this condition, this persona has that condition and what do we do drug wise or therapy wise.\n",
      "And now it’s like the CBT is getting bigger poster board so people can say “oh wow, how bout that”.\n",
      "So I think now its getting more of a claim of therapy to do.\n",
      "Interviewer: ok\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, according to the slides it said 6 videos, 15 minutes each.\n",
      "So that could be different elements of CBT.\n",
      "Not quite sure, that’s kind of what our focus group is trying to figure out like the when, what, how, where.\n",
      "The whole aspect of it so I don’t think anything is set in stone yet.\n",
      "Speaker: Just I would always take into consideration you don’t want to make it more than 22 minutes and you want it more than 7 because you can usually get messages across to people better in that little time frame of 7 to 22 minutes for kids and for adults for that matter.\n",
      "Interviewer: Note takers is there anything you needed clarified or questions on?\n",
      "Note Taker- I guess toward the beginning with the question saying like “What did you want to know about CBT when you first started?” You said you didn’t have any you could think of, so maybe now that we’ve talked about it\n",
      "Speaker: Maybe the only thing would be about it would be just the time table, but with the realization of it, for some people it’s a long process.\n",
      "But just uh.\n",
      "Speaker: But a general idea would be nice.\n",
      "Speaker: a general idea yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: Like typically with this happens with this kid happens… You can’t be specific but you can go like you know, “If you work a little harder at this particular challenge, then you know you do it five days a week versus one you’re gonna move further ahead.”\n",
      "Those things that we do in our own sessions, the more you do that the faster you’re gonna progress.\n",
      "Those kind of things would be helpful to know that the more you do it, the more you practice and do your homework and what not, and you’ll get there faster.\n",
      "Interviewer: Anything else?\n",
      "I’ll go grab [Name Redacted] and we can let you guys get out of here?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, thank you so much for meeting with us today.\n",
      "I’m working with a group of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists on a project about cognitive behavior therapy and the kind of therapy your daughter has been doing, and for this project we want to develop a short educational video that would describe this type of therapy and give a little more insight to patients and family to what they can expect from cognitive behavior therapy.\n",
      "Also, cognitive behavior therapy is pretty long so throughout I’m just going to shorten it to CBT.\n",
      "So to start can you tell me what comes to mind when you think of CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: A therapist or psychologist talking with the adolescent about, or even an adult, about ways to handle different stressors um so… um it’s something that helps to reframe how a child sees or experiences what they think is a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, definitely so helping them handle certain stressors and kind of reframing their cognition and could you tell me what you know about CBT in your own words.\n",
      "What would you explain what it is?\n",
      "Speaker: Can you restate the question.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes, so in your own words if you had to provide a definition of what CBT is, what would you say that it is?\n",
      "I know kind of what you mentioned is what comes to mind to you is kind of a good definition.\n",
      "You know kind of summarize that.\n",
      "Speaker: Narrow it down.\n",
      "Cognitive behavior therapy would be… not supposed to say the same word in the definition.\n",
      "Therapy or meeting one-on-one with a CBT trained specialist or psychologist with a patient um and to try to change behavior by thinking of things in a different way.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, ok awesome!\n",
      "And when you first learned about this type of therapy that we do here, do you remember if you had any questions or if there was something specific you wanted to know about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Well, I also have gone through considerable CBT therapy so when it came time for my daughter to um go through it as well I didn’t hesitate to put her in it because I knew it was something that worked.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So they're speaking ignorantly.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "This might seem like a weird question, but actually the word hoarding gets used a lot in reference to this whole COVID thing.\n",
      "I know that they're not talking about hoarding disorder, but they're talking about hoarding in the sense of taking too much stuff.\n",
      "Does that ever figure into how you think about your own behavior?\n",
      "I mean, how do you react when you hear people being called hoarders in the context of COVID?\n",
      "Do you feel like that's at all related?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "No, because of the fact that this is more of like fight or flight type of hoarding in the sense that people feel like if they have to go out and get stuff, it's like every time I go out, it's a Russian type thing.\n",
      "And so it's more of a survival thing as opposed to an issue where a stockpile or what have you.\n",
      "Because I mean, I think it's based on fear out of trying to feel safe because I think the hoarding issue has something because usually the person has had some type of traumatic issue happened in their life that they're trying to cover up or something.\n",
      "Versus somebody that wants to make sure that they have what they need so that they could stand high for this length of time because people outside are dying.\n",
      "Because today I just had to turn off the TV.\n",
      "It was just too much.\n",
      "People are scared because just think like 700 and something people died yesterday in New York. 700 people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I understand.\n",
      "Yeah, people are panicking.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "If I had the choice of hoarding a little toilet paper so I didn't have to go outside and possibly catch this thing, heck yeah.\n",
      "So I don't think it's the same thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it changed your behavior at all?\n",
      "Do you feel like you've bought more stuff because of the fear that you'll get stuck inside?\n",
      "Do you feel like you've engaged in any of that?\n",
      "Has it made [crosstalk 00:55:38]?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I feel like I lost something, but I also have to talk myself into, \"If I really want another one, I can get it.\"\n",
      "But I'm not understanding the loss of that spice jar, or I'm not understanding why I feel so terrible throwing things away.\n",
      "Now I do throw garbage away.\n",
      "It's interesting, but I don't consider a spice jar garbage.\n",
      "You can get them in the store a dime a dozen, every time you buy a spice, so there's one always available.\n",
      "By the way, I have plenty of other spices, so I don't know the attachment to that thing.\n",
      "I have no personal attachment, so I don't understand why I had to think about this the whole week, and it just drained me.\n",
      "But I did get rid of it, but I'm still talking about it.\n",
      "Now some days it's a little more clear, and I feel...\n",
      "The good side is, maybe if you think of the tenths.\n",
      "One tenth, two tenths, three tenths.\n",
      "There is now a one-tenth thing going, \"Hey, I don't feel bad.\n",
      "I feel good I got rid of something, that's one less thing I have to worry about,\" but it's still nine tenths, \"Why?\n",
      "Why do I have to let stuff go?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I imagine that this must be very difficult and confusing for you.\n",
      "Since you expressed a lot of distress around this situation, it sounds like you're very aware, and are working on improving some of the changes you'd like to see.\n",
      "Have you ever sought professional help, or asked anyone else for help with your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, I did go to a psychologist for many years.\n",
      "I even took medication, while being-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When did you see the psychologist?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Okay, so let's see now.\n",
      "It's been about 10 years, and I went to him for about... I went to a psychologist, but before then I went to a, what is that called?\n",
      "They're not psychologists, but they're family-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Psychiatrists?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "No, no. They're-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Family counselors?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah, family counselor.\n",
      "Because I was having issues with my relationship, based on the hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That was your ex that you mentioned earlier?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, okay.\n",
      "Where did you-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "So I went to a family counselor to figure out why we keep breaking up and why...\n",
      "And then later I had to go to a psychologist because they thought maybe medication will bring it down.\n",
      "But it turns out I did need some vitamin D, so that's helping a little bit, I think, so-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you...\n",
      "It is?\n",
      "Yeah, it probably would.\n",
      "I also find it helpful.\n",
      "I take a lot of vitamins, too.\n",
      "I definitely feel better when I do that.\n",
      "Do you remember what medication you took, and are you still on it?\n",
      "Interview 013\n",
      "Interviewee: Who do encounter this primarily not as psychiatrists or psychologists because by the very nature of these, the people that… It’s a very small subset of hoarders that actually seek out care.\n",
      "And so, when the original literature on hoarding was written, before they were even calling hoarding a thing, a disorder certainly, it was people that were self selected going to OCD hoarding clinics.\n",
      "So, that’s how it got sort of linked in to OCD, because that’s who was seeking treatment.\n",
      "And it took a long time to sort of shed that because that’s where all of the original work was done and it made sense because that’s where it first appeared.\n",
      "As everybody has learned and as you certainly have pointed out, that’s just one small piece of the puzzle and it’s probably not the predominant piece of the puzzle.\n",
      "So, I think this idea of exploring the range of possibilities out there is very anthropological.\n",
      "(INAUDIBLE, 1:02)\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so the original purpose of this project was to try to do two things.\n",
      "One was to try to capture the way that clinical knowledge on this topic has (INAUDIBLE, 1:17) and changed and how different kinds of providers think about this disorder differently.\n",
      "Especially, because it’s just now, as you pointed out, been brought out from under the OCD umbrella.\n",
      "Also to solve the problem that you brought up which is not necessarily solved, but to speak to the problem that you brought up which is most people with this disorder are not like “Oh my gosh, I have a huge problem and I have to go sort this out with a doctor.”\n",
      "Quite the contrary, they’re very resistant in many cases to seeing their behavior as problematic and very resistant to getting treatment.\n",
      "So, they’re thinking about their behavior in such a different way than their clinicians that they’re coming to such different conclusions.\n",
      "I think that for that reason the people who, we’ll get into the course of the interview, but a lot of times clinicians kind of hit a wall when you ask them about people who have low insight into their disorder because they’ve never encountered any patients who have low insight into their disorder, because if they’re seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist they already have insight into their disorder to some extent.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Self-fulfilling prophecy\n",
      "But, yeah low confidence in memory I think is a big one as opposed to a memory deficit itself.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, our final question is extremely broad, and I’m sure that we could probably talk for an hour just about this one.\n",
      "But if you were to say what you think the biggest things are that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder or the biggest unanswered questions in your mind?\n",
      "And again, that’s a very big question but.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "All of it?\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Literally we don’t know anything about hoarding.\n",
      "Well I take that back.\n",
      "We don’t know nothing, but we know very little.\n",
      "I still don’t think we’ve understood what causes hoarding disorder.\n",
      "I mean we know what some of the correlates are, but I think we are a long way from understanding what kinds of things actually make hoarding disorder occur.\n",
      "And I think when it comes to treatment you know we’ve got a treatment that’s only about half way good and still doesn’t result in remission for most of the patients that receive it.\n",
      "So, I think that the other big piece is we need to understand what kind of treatments might be more affective then what we currently have.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay those are some big questions to answer in the future.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well I really appreciate your time.\n",
      "That’s all the questions that I have for you today.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure, my pleasure.\n",
      "Interviewer: And thinking about yours and your child’s experience was there anything about CBT that was confusing?\n",
      "Speaker: About the… I didn’t know how… didn’t know the method um and they didn’t tell me.\n",
      "I mean they told me it was a CBT based therapy, but I had go find out what CBT was because they weren’t going to tell me how they were going to work with me or my daughter so.\n",
      "Kind of had to find out along the way.\n",
      "07: 27 Interviewer: mmh yeah so really like the method, the process was what was confusing.\n",
      "Speaker: I do have to say that learning the breathing techniques at first, or actually for a while and for some people, I know it was very strange so I’ve been through DBT as well and um some people I remember just seemed to think that it was just more Buddhist type of an activity and I know I also sort of thought that as well because some of the… if you say the word meditation if you are talking to kids from strong Interviewer background, people who do still go to church although it seems like we are dwindling group um, it’s a little put offish in way.\n",
      "You have to make yourself overcome the way it sounds to accept the way it works.\n",
      "interviewer: Right, ok awesome and what would you want to tell someone who is about start CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Give it time to work.\n",
      "If it feels weird the first time in the first session its ok.\n",
      "It’s not just talk therapy.\n",
      "There is a purpose for it.\n",
      "There is a goal in mind.\n",
      "You are not just going to be stuck in talk therapy forever so give it three to five sessions before you make a strong opinion about what it is and how it is affecting your child’s behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: So being patient and knowing that it truly is a goal-oriented type practice.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok awesome and if you could think of three words to describe CBT when you first learned about it, what would those be?\n",
      "Speaker: I’m thinking.\n",
      "Interviewer: Take your time\n",
      "Speaker: Calmness, reframing… all I can think about are sentences um… I can’t think of another word.\n",
      "I can think of mindfulness… being in the moment.\n",
      "I don’t know how to say that in one word.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s ok because that’s three words.\n",
      "Yeah that works.\n",
      "So for each of those words if you had to add a picture to them calmness, reframing, mindfulness, or being in the moment what would they look like?\n",
      "Speaker: I would think that would differ for each person.\n",
      "For me it would be a safe place somewhere where didn’t feel threatened.\n",
      "For me it’s beside like the side of a small river where there is water coming down or you can hear the trickling of water and um just having a nice temperature and a little bit of sun in your face.\n",
      "Just peacefulness and just the lack of threat.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what about for reframing.\n",
      "What would that look like?\n",
      "Speaker: So reframing would be like I have a memory of an event that happened and I think of it almost has my… it’s complicated but I. Um so reframing would be me having my opinion about based on limited information at the time when I was a child and having the therapist or the psychologist ask me what would have happened if my mom had taken me somewhere else..\n",
      "Um...\n",
      "What would have happened if there… what other outcome could have occurred?\n",
      "Interviewer: So kind of like presenting a hypothetical.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes. If you lost one of these things that you thought was important to keep, how would you feel?\n",
      "I know earlier you mentioned the spice rack, you're still struggling with that.\n",
      "So let's say one of these papers, if you lost it, what would happen?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Well, now you may have something that's very interesting.\n",
      "So the other day I went to a bag of papers, a small bag, good bag, and I see it was all stuff from the '90s, right?\n",
      "And so I'm reading it.\n",
      "I said, \"Nita, you need to go through this.\n",
      "There might be something important.\"\n",
      "So I'm actually reading it, and there are stuffs, remember surveys, that are taken that are no longer true anymore.\n",
      "And believe it or not, I was able to throw that away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow, awesome.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah, because I said, \"Oh, they've updated this.\n",
      "This item is no longer true, so I don't need to prove anything.\n",
      "I can actually get rid of it.\"\n",
      "I did find duplicate recipes in that bag, and I was able to get rid of those, because I know I have a set already.\n",
      "But it was something current, because my living room, my dining room table has about four foot high of newspapers that I'm still going through, that I think has something important in it.\n",
      "Now here's where the argument came with my ex.\n",
      "He was home one day and he said, \"Oh, I sorted through your papers, and the ones you wanted to keep I kept for you, and the ones you wanted to get rid of,\" well he doesn't know a hoarder, so he didn't understand I didn't want to get rid of anything, and I went into a fit.\n",
      "And that's not a good thing, but I can get rid of 1990s stuff, I just can't get rid of yesterday's stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you mentioned having a fit, what is that like for you?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Oh, I melted down.\n",
      "I went crazy.\n",
      "\"Don't touch my stuff.\n",
      "Leave my stuff alone.\n",
      "You don't know me, you don't need it.\n",
      "You don't know if I needed it.\n",
      "You don't know if I wanted it.\n",
      "If you don't know,\" you know what I mean?\n",
      "So that kind of a, \"You just leave me alone,\" and we probably even separated at that time.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "My friends kind of ... A couple of my friends are similar.\n",
      "They're at different levels too.\n",
      "They like to hold on to stuff too, so they're not very judgemental.\n",
      "One has mentioned that maybe I need a desk to put my papers on, which I did actually ...\n",
      "In my bedroom, I have a desk that I just cleared off.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the stuff I cleared off the desk is now on the floor, so it didn't really get anywhere.\n",
      "But I do have a clear desk.\n",
      "I've always used my table as my desk.\n",
      "I live alone.\n",
      "I can eat and still have my bills and my things on the table.\n",
      "If someone comes over though, I do clear that off.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:27:26] room and make the table really presentable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "But lately though, my daughter-in-law's parents have moved up, so none of the social things are happening at my house anymore, and they say because my house isn't as big as her parent's house.\n",
      "That's part of it, and the other part is that their house is clean.\n",
      "They can have people over and have them be comfortable in their house.\n",
      "That kind of makes me sad because I used to have people over for the holidays, and that gave me a chance to actually clean the house and make it suitable for people.\n",
      "Now I don't have that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now that we're talking more about your own home, can you tell me what you would like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I would like it to be organized and clean, just everything in its place.\n",
      "I would like to get rid of all the old papers.\n",
      "I can remember the things I'm proud of with my school stuff.\n",
      "I can get rid of those.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So just to have things in it's place.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "More open space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "An open space, yeah.\n",
      "So you would like everything to have its own space.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, its own place and space and more space.\n",
      "I have 1,000 square foot house.\n",
      "It's two story.\n",
      "It's small, but it's cute and it could be really cute.\n",
      "The outside is painted.\n",
      "I've got solar panels.\n",
      "The outside looks really presentable.\n",
      "Inside, you're like ah.\n",
      "Another lady came in, a beautician came in one time and she asked me if I was renting.\n",
      "That made me realize that I'm not keeping things up either.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "She couldn't have me at her place so she came here.\n",
      "I was like ooh.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So how important are things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Which objects are the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I missed the first part of that?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How important are things for you to feel at home in your space?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "How important is it for me to feel at home in my space?\n",
      "Interviewer: Just before we start, when you think about the DSM5 criteria for hoarding disorder are there particular elements of the criteria that you regard as particularly difficult to apply or that perhaps different clinicians may apply differently or are perhaps more reliant on something like clinical judgment.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think probably the hardest one for me is that last one of the symptoms are not attributable to another mental disorder.\n",
      "You know in one really common example we see of that is when there is a comorbid attention deficit or activity disorder.\n",
      "Which you know by definition disrupt executive function and difficulty with executive function decision making is really you know one of the major features we’ve seen in hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So, I think that makes it very tricky.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So now I am going to go through the DSM5 criteria and read you a couple of key phrases from the criteria, and I’d just like to know more about your thought process as you apply to individual patients.\n",
      "So, the first one is: persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value, and so the kind of question we had about your application of this one is: how are you determining value, and how does that the value of the items that are saved play into the diagnosis of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s very difficult to determine value because it’s so subjective.\n",
      "You know usually I think in cases of hoarding disorder we find it not terribly difficult because what the person is saving is often garbage.\n",
      "And so that makes it easy you know the possessions are not like right on the line between valuable and in-valuable there fairly clear.\n",
      "You know when there is some value to the item that are being saved, I think that it becomes trickier.\n",
      "The way that the criteria is worded doesn’t necessarily say that the person is saving worthless things, even though that’s what we usually think about.\n",
      "It just says they are keeping regardless of their actual values.\n",
      "So, you know a person theoretically could hoard valuable things.\n",
      "I guess in most clinical cases of hoarding disorder we find even if there are valuable things that are mixed in with things that others would probably call junk.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, it’s seems like for you the emphasis in this criteria is not so much on the value but that they have the difficulty in discarding or parting.\n",
      "It doesn’t really matter if they are appropriately valuing items, if they are having difficulty discarding them.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think so.\n",
      "I have to in my sense of experience, that for most hoarders this need to save is sort of discriminants, you know?\n",
      "Like I very rarely, I don’t want to say never, but I very rarely meet somebody who is compelled to save only certain things but not others.\n",
      "You know like when a case of hoarding disorder, like it’s really clear its hoarding, I think what we see is they’re not really making any decisions at all, they are just sort of saving everything.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, again maybe that’s not so much that they are inappropriately valuing so much as they are not making distinctions in value.\n",
      "Everything is kind of equally valuable.\n",
      "Speaker: I’d probably use the term that usually you feel anxiety you feel powerless.\n",
      "Powerless over whatever certain things that may be causing you anxiety or powerless that you don’t know what to do about the behavior that is manifesting from that.\n",
      "Not feeling you have the power\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, yeah.\n",
      "Um, is there anything else that might be important for other patients to know how anxiety is becoming a problem in their life?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, I think sometimes as an individual you might not always understand and see the anxiety’s being overwhelming, sometimes its family members or people closest to you that give you a wakeup call or kind of an intervention that you need to have help with your anxiety.\n",
      "Um, sometimes its hard for the individual to be able to see (20:15)___.\n",
      "Um, it kind of sometimes they have to go to rock bottom before they can go wait a minute I really need some help somewhere else because my anxiety is overwhelming and taking over my life.\n",
      "“I feel I have no life”, kind of thing.\n",
      "Speaker: The uh, you know we’ve had to look at our daughter, we’ve had to look at our family, but we have access to both of those areas.\n",
      "My daughter still feels, I mean she has anxiety, also though, at school, with teachers and with fellow students.\n",
      "We don’t have access to those really and I don’t know, I don’t have a suggestion on how do you get access that, but I have gone to talk to her teachers but um.\n",
      "Interviewer: um could you guys tell me if there are\n",
      "Speaker: I think CBT targets the brains ability to, if something bad happens, give you a better perspective or give you a way out.\n",
      "If you use CBT the right way you are able to overcome obstacles that normally with the anxiety brain would hold you back.\n",
      "So CBT gives you the tools and the ability to push away the stuff and go “okay let’s tackle this and um the ‘we’re gonna get this done’ attitude.”\n",
      "Speaker: Would you ask the question again?\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, um any specific skills or areas that CBT targets?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, faulty thinking and trying to recognize when you’re not um where your thinking a situation is one thing but it’s not really and then the ramifications of that.\n",
      "I think faulty thinking and recognition of the behaviors that you’re doing.\n",
      "050\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then we have after we do a couple of lists, we'll just get into the more kind of conversational part of the interview where I'll just ask you questions and we'll talk like normal people.\n",
      "Okay?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "Well, thank you for doing those lists with me now, we're going to get into the more kind of fun part of our interview.\n",
      "So just to begin with, I would like to start by having you kind of describe your problems with hoarding.\n",
      "What they're like for you, when they began and how it's kind of changed over time.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "My problems with hoarding.\n",
      "First I think that it's always, maybe has been there.\n",
      "I grew up with my grandmother who was a depression person and didn't throw away anything.\n",
      "So I was used to a lot of stuff.\n",
      "The temperaments to that is not recognizing as a form of hoarding is that my mother worked from, I guess she basically stayed home and she cleaned up after all of us so we never felt the weight or because everything was always cleared or put away.\n",
      "Either no matter how the day started out, by the time we got home from school or my grandmother got home for work, my mother had put everything to right.\n",
      "And we never felt the first effect of it.\n",
      "When I got to college, my first roommate I didn't spend much time there.\n",
      "And then the second roommate, she and I almost shared some of the same things in the sense that our room would be cluttered and everything like that.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "But it was sort of like, I don't know, we were able to live with each other because it was sort of organized but it was not like we didn't know where anything was.\n",
      "And then as I got to be an adult, I pretty much came back home.\n",
      "And so my mom took back over.\n",
      "It's only when I started living by myself, I think and it just progressively got worse.\n",
      "The more I think loneliness or the fact that I couldn't trust people, that it was sort of like almost a behavior that kept me isolated, before I even knew how badly I was isolated, if that makes sense.\n",
      "It was something that stuck on gradually.\n",
      "And then accumulating things was my way of self-medicating.\n",
      "Also, I think my self-esteem was sort of low because I've always been sort of overweight and when put forth with other ladies is I went through a system where we would have to go to a lot of parties and meetings and everybody dressed so wonderfully because basically you were dressing for other women.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you said you have an apartment and you mentioned that you have maybe more in too big furniture than would fit in that apartment.\n",
      "Are you able to use all of the rooms?\n",
      "Are you able to go in and out of the spaces comfortably?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Not comfortably.\n",
      "I have to be really careful or I could easily fall down because I'm skipping around things to get where I needed to go.\n",
      "And I sleep in a small space on my bed like the people on the TV.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But you're able to get onto your bed.\n",
      "Are you able to use your kitchen, your bathroom?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah, I can use it, but it's not pristine or anything like that.\n",
      "So yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the space is still basically usable by you for the things that you need to do, but it sounds like it's difficult for you to navigate and not easy for you to kind of do the things that you might want to do, and you're worried about falling that sound, right?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Because there's boxes and there's just stuff because it's been my apartment for the longest time, because it's just been me.\n",
      "It's been a drop and go situation where I don't, sometimes it gets too quiet.\n",
      "I love movies, so I like to watch movies.\n",
      "It's my way of escaping as opposed to somebody who might have a drink because drinking scares me because my mom was an alcoholic.\n",
      "So can't use that to shake off the day because my job stresses me out because it's just, sometimes I feel like a whore because basically I'm doing it for the money, not for the joy, not for anything other than a paycheck.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "And it makes me have to dumb down for eight hours a day.\n",
      "So I don't like to sometimes stay here even though maybe I can watch a movie or something because it's just too quiet.\n",
      "So that's part of the shopping thing is just to get out of the house-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's like your recreation.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "And not to be here, not because it's dirty, but almost just not to be here because there's nobody there but me.\n",
      "I really miss having a dog that helped a great deal.\n",
      "Although I'm having the doctor stop it just got worse after I stopped having the dog.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you feel like having the dog was helpful because you had company and so you didn't shop as much?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I had to be home because you just got to walk the dog or I was going to have poop to clean up when I got home and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It gave you a routine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That seems like it goes back to what you mentioned earlier in terms of feeling like you save stuff because of almost ambition.\n",
      "It sounds like that same kind of behavior.\n",
      "You have the ambition of making everything perfect, and then when you can't get it done, it just sits around.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I mean, I'm just trying to repeat back to you.\n",
      "I'm not, I'm trying to-\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "No, no, sometimes you don't hear what you're saying.\n",
      "So you just have to go, \"Okay, well maybe that's what I did say.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, the reason I'm repeating it back is to make sure that I'm understanding.\n",
      "So please feel free to correct me if that doesn't sound right.\n",
      "Now I'd like to hear a little bit about your stuff and your space.\n",
      "So if you could just tell me a little bit about what your apartment is like for you.\n",
      "And what the space is like and also the kinds of things that you tend to hang on to and how they are situated in your space right now.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Well, my condo was 1386 as far as square feet.\n",
      "Now I live in apartment that's less than 700 square feet.\n",
      "So I had big furniture that is too small, really for the space.\n",
      "And then when my grandmother died, I got some of her antiques and they're really not me anymore, but this is going to sound funny, but just out of fear of her raising out of the dead, Some of them I'm almost fearful to get rid of but also cost-wise, I couldn't afford to redo anything or anything like that.\n",
      "But it's mostly clothes.\n",
      "And then it's mostly things that are part of good intentions in the sense that this is how I want my space to look like or I have an idea.\n",
      "And so when I get around to it, I want this to happen.\n",
      "And so, I have a curate that's in a box because I have found that I like this particular curate coffee more than I usually liked the six bucks cup of coffee at Starbucks, but I'm yet to set it up.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "And then I have just outfits from all different kinds of sizes and things that I will undo a pile or whatever.\n",
      "And then I told her that I thought that, and then I got into a swing of going to Goodwill because it was cheap so I really wasn't spending that much money as opposed to but I have shopped for that a little bit just say you know, do I really need it.\n",
      "And trying to stop it to the sense that I really have enough.\n",
      "And so it's just mostly filled with clothes and items like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are they in boxes or are they out?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Most of it's out.\n",
      "All of my dishes, I didn't buy china.\n",
      "I bought pottery, like pottery tumblers instead of glasses.\n",
      "And I forgot I had a lot of CDs.\n",
      "I got rid of almost all of the 33s years ago, maybe 15 years ago.\n",
      "But I have a lot of CDs and DVDs that ...\n",
      "None of this, realistically, can I live long enough to use or read or watch or listen to, but they're hard to let go.\n",
      "I could read some of that stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you decide when it's time to get rid of something?\n",
      "How do you know?\n",
      "And what do you discard when it's time?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "How do I know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sorry?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Well, what happens now is, now that I've started cleaning up, I did once it before, and it stopped and got much worse, kind of like losing weight goes.\n",
      "But now that I've started again, it's much easier.\n",
      "Because one of the good things for me is the pleasure of having somebody else using it and enjoying it.\n",
      "Like I have some DVDs, for example, that I haven't even taken the cellophane or whatever it's called, the plastic wrap, off of.\n",
      "And my thought is, if somebody can't afford something, and they can get that at a thrift shop, that's neat that they can have something that's brand new that nobody's used.\n",
      "Or with clothing, sometimes I have clothing ... I had the bariatric surgery I mentioned in about 2001.\n",
      "I didn't have many clothes before that, and now I have a lot more clothes.\n",
      "And I can give clothes away, again thinking, some things still have a label on them, a price label.\n",
      "And I keep thinking, \"Won't that be neat, that somebody who can't afford something new can get something brand new?\n",
      "It's obvious it hasn't been worn.\"\n",
      "So that helps me give stuff away.\n",
      "Is that the kind of thing you were asking?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Kind of.\n",
      "But how do you know when it's time to actually give those things away?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "When it's time to?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Well, it's when I do like what I'm doing now.\n",
      "My friend, because of this whole coronavirus thing, can't come down because we're in lockdown, but when I work with her, each time I work, I can more quickly and easily give stuff away.\n",
      "So, time to give away in that sense is not, \"This thing is old,\" it's just that, \"You know what?\n",
      "I got to clean up this house.\n",
      "I have too much stuff, and this can go.\n",
      "Take this.\"\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "It's more of an attitude that it's time to give things away, when I can get in the right frame of mind.\n",
      "Speaker: I think it would be helpful, although, well first of all, I’ve read a lot about it even before it was needed and um but you know, it would be helpful for parents if they have an anxiety over this then they could go somewhere, whether it’s a website or a hand out or whatever you want to do.\n",
      "Like a reading list or you know recommended readings you know to help direct them, so you know not wondering aimlessly through the internet and running across helpful or unhelpful information.\n",
      "You know it would be better, I would think, that if you all as a group felt that there was articles or other level of sophistication those articles are that a parent could go, if they wanted to, to read more and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, did you guys know about someone else’s experience with CBT?\n",
      "Um and was it positive or negative and overall what would be useful for others to know?\n",
      "We kind of touched on it a little bit already.\n",
      "Speaker: For us, um, personal experience our self for us as parents to our children so it was easier for us to go jump into this CBT because it’s just a way of getting tools and whatnot, for the life to com.\n",
      "And I think, uh, the CBT itself is a process that is needed and adults need to know about it enough so they have that option to give it to their children; give that positive hope.\n",
      "Speaker: I had uh, where people have gone through it but not in depth of what they had done.\n",
      "I did not hear anything negative about it so I just assumed it was positive.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, um so like I was saying, we want to develop a few videos about CBT so now I’m going to ask a few questions more about the videos.\n",
      "Um, so first we’ll need to decide who will be in the video, so any ideas of characters we should include?\n",
      "Not specific characters but like, you know, humans, animals.\n",
      "Like broadly speaking.\n",
      "Speaker: Well, I think that um you get two target audiences here, the adults and the parents.\n",
      "I think it’s easier to do toward the children because if you do it towards the children the parents will, the parents will watch kids’ stuff more than kids will watch parents stuff.\n",
      "And so I think having a video toward your child, that’s going to inform the parents also.\n",
      "And if you’re dealing with children who I think maybe who are pre-puberty, you know having uh, nonhumans sometimes they can relate better than somebody they’re actually seeing and you know?\n",
      "Um… Again I think that it’s easier to do something toward a younger audience and anybody older is going to understand it versus you know if somebody’s younger they might not understand if you do it toward a target audience that’s older.\n",
      "Speaker: I agree I would do, it, something that might catch younger kids to even older ones like almost like an anime or the characters of people, real people but in like a cartoon kind of fashion so that it’s engaging enough that you’ll get different areas of groups from young kids to teens and whatnot.\n",
      "They’ll watch it and a parent like you said, will always watch what they’re kids are doing.\n",
      "I would keep it more humanlike versus animal-like because it’s more, you’re relating to a human character versus like “the bear” or you know “the tree” or something that’s inanimate or something that’s living but not humanlike, I think might not come across for the kids to go “oh that character is just like me”.\n",
      "So if it’s more human related I feel like it’s more like oh that little girl is like me, you know, kind of thing.\n",
      "You know that’s something I think that’s like (31:42)\n",
      ".\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah, well when I hurt my leg I had to take a photo of it to show to the doctor, and in the background... I looked at the photo and I said, \"Look at all this stuff.\n",
      "I can't take a photo anywhere in my house without all this stuff.\"\n",
      "So I realized, I think seeing the photo of the place, and also maybe watching TV with this hoarder shows, that it just probably came over to me after I fell is, I got too much stuff, and I don't use it all.\n",
      "It just sits there, so-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The hoarding TV show, how do you...\n",
      "I've seen those on TV as well.\n",
      "How do you feel about that show?\n",
      "Would you say it's an accurate portrayal, or do you like or dislike the way that they make people who struggle with hoarding disorder appear?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "No I actually think, and I do get tips from them.\n",
      "I actually think it's a good show.\n",
      "I understand-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Okay, so you find it helpful?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, that's why I watch it, because I have to remind myself, \"Look, everyone denies they're a hoarder.\"\n",
      "I mean initially.\n",
      "I think if you'd have talked to me 10 years ago, I wouldn't have told you I was a hoarder.\n",
      "But everyone on that show, whether they collect human feces or animals, all the way down to what I would call a one or a two, just normal collecting.\n",
      "They all say, \"No, I don't think I'm a hoarder,\" and they've got rats running around.\n",
      "And everything down to, just the other day I saw one where she was more my level.\n",
      "Just everything was clean, but just so much stuff that she couldn't move around.\n",
      "And they tried to get...\n",
      "She was very anxious about getting up her stuff, and I felt the same way.\n",
      "I get it.\n",
      "I get, I can see other people, I just have to apply it to myself.\n",
      "So I do like the way they help people, and I do think it's a useful show.\n",
      "I can understand where some people might think it's not rude, but very strict.\n",
      "But I don't think it's strict.\n",
      "I think it's a kind thing, but some people might not understand it, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there... I know you've already talked about which items you thought were important.\n",
      "You mentioned your cookbooks, and how certain items you keep in the basement, you don't use.\n",
      "Which items do you spend a lot of time with, comparatively?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Probably my papers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your papers.\n",
      "Interviewer: And there does seem to be a parallel between seeking out animals to collect and seeking out chandeliers as opposed to with object hoarding where it’s just kind of like you said an accumulation of not throwing stuff out.\n",
      "Interviewee: Even with object hoarding though I mean there are people that do the trash pickup every day.\n",
      "The night before trash day, they’re out there with their car driving around the neighborhood looking for fun.\n",
      "So even though it looks like a jumble, it’s a deliberate jumble.\n",
      "As opposed to somebody saying, “Oh, I’m going to go out on Saturday night and just find coo-coo clocks.”\n",
      "Maybe you’ll see that to some degree too, but that’s bordering more on collecting, I think, than hoarding because it’s more of a focused good and maybe you don’t have the filth and other kinds of things.\n",
      "A lot of this goes back again to the point we talked about where you have this final common pathway, the endpoint, the behavior that you see and it’s a real open question of how much can we try to prescribe general help previous generalities to that endpoint.\n",
      "You have to be real careful with that.\n",
      "You just don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, just because we’re seeing people with a lot of animals doesn’t mean those people are necessarily similar in the reasons they’ve acquired those animals or how they ended up becoming people who acquire a lot of animals.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, we don’t know.\n",
      "I think maybe that’s the case, but I think it’s just way too early to tell because we need interviews, we need good case histories, and we’ve got snippets of stuff that hang together but that’s a far cry from claiming eureka.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s kind of the state of knowledge about object hoarding as well was kind of in that same place where there are a lot of really big unanswered questions.\n",
      "I think a lot of the reason for those questions remaining unanswered is how difficult it is to find–\n",
      "Interviewee: Bingo!\n",
      "Interviewer: –people to talk to who will talk to you who self-identify.\n",
      "So, here’s another question for you.\n",
      "How do you feel that popular media conceptions of animal hoarding, like for example thinking of people as “crazy cat ladies,” how does that play into the phenomena of animal hoarding as it is actually kind of going on?\n",
      "So do people self-identify as crazy cat ladies or do they say “I’m not a crazy cat lady because…”\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, probably not the ones who truly are hoarders.\n",
      "They have people with cat t-shirts and they have the cat clothing and all of the other stuff and they do it kind of tongue-in-cheek.\n",
      "Even though they do care for a lot of cats and stuff, but those are people that are doing it precisely because they have insight, see what I mean?\n",
      "Because you need the insight to play the joke at yourself.\n",
      "The folks that we’re seeing they don’t have the insight to do that.\n",
      "But I think for the ones that do where there is that border-line area I mean yeah the stereotypes certainly don’t help.\n",
      "Nobody wants to be–they have enough insight to know that that’s a bad label and they’ll even sometimes have to be pushed back and say “I’m a hoarder.”\n",
      "So they’ve heard of the term by now.\n",
      "I had a woman who was well known in the community once come to one of my lectures (INAUDIBLE 42:32).\n",
      "Interviewer: And does that change depending on what sort of problem with insight they have?\n",
      "For instance, if somebody’s chief providence with overvalued ideation they might be aware there is a deficit but still have a delusion.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well frankly, in a case like that I’m a little bit different.\n",
      "I don’t have to convince you that you have a hoarding problem you are already know you have a hoarding problem.\n",
      "In case of overvalued ideation, I use more cognitive restructuring strategies.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: In which my aim is more to help you critically evaluate what you are thinking and see if it’s realistic and maybe even do some hypothesis testing.\n",
      "So that you can get a reality check against your thoughts.\n",
      "And if the person is more defensive that’s when I’m probably going to use, it’s going to be a little bit more of the motivational interviewing kind of procedure where I am going to be non-threatening and non-directive to see if I can get them to start talking about the problem in a relaxed manner.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "And do you see these different kinds of insight as perhaps different points along a progress, do you feel like people start out with anosognosia and move towards defensiveness or overvalued ideation or do you think that that’s not necessarily how it works?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t think that’s necessarily how it works.\n",
      "I think there are three different constructs.\n",
      "Arguably you could say that some are worse than other but I don’t that its necessary that a person moves from one to the next.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you think about the patients that you have seen come in on their own who have a least some sort of level of insight already.\n",
      "Do you have any sense of how people gain that insight outside of a clinical setting, is it through interactions with family members or do they come to it on their own somehow?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s a mixture of both.\n",
      "I mean certainly we have some hoarding patients whose insight is pretty good and they just realize on their own that this is a problem and they wanted to do something about it.\n",
      "We have some patients who have discovered it by watching television, they watch hoarders and that was enough that it kind of cued something in their brain that says “wow, maybe my problem isn’t as bad as that but maybe I do kind of have a problem”.\n",
      "And I think there is another group of people who have to get to that level of awareness through their family members, you know by having family members repeatedly express their concerns to them.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you think about the patients you have come in either because they have been motivated by their family or some self-motivated, how long do these patients tend to say their behavior has gone on before they come in for treatment?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well most of them say they have been engaging in this behavior since adolescents or early adulthood.\n",
      "And our average patient with hoarding disorder is somewhere around 55 years old, so I think the average patient that we see says they have been hoarding for at least 30-40 years before they come in for treatment with us.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think about the stuff that you have, do you think that it's valuable?\n",
      "Do you think that the items in your home are valuable?\n",
      "And how do you determine which of those are the most valuable?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I think that they are valuable.\n",
      "I think that like that Marie whatever thing, I think it's the stuff that brings me the most joy and the stuff that I have really, really wanted to get that I had been waiting a while to get.\n",
      "Because of the fact that I still don't know, I've been jet in life that it's sort of I need instant gratification because waiting around a little stuck for things to get started that's not so.\n",
      "And I just had a sticky moment.\n",
      "Tell me the question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I was kind of wondering if you think that the things that you have are valuable and which things you value the most of the things you have.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I think the things that I do have a valuable, because when I shop, I do shop for value and I buy things that I really like not because they're on sale, but also I try to say, if I'll have a use for it, I'll but.\n",
      "Or something like a clothes something, I have an idea of where I'm going to wear it, when I'm going to wear.\n",
      "How many pairs of pants it'll go with and stuff like that.\n",
      "And if I can only wear it with one thing or whatever, I don't think I'll ever have a chance to wear it, then I don't get it.\n",
      "and then as far as.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So maybe one way of thinking about this is what do you think is the most valuable or precious thing that you have in your house?\n",
      "And this can be precious to you or it can be objectively.\n",
      "Totally depends on you, how you would like to answer that question.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I think the most valuable thing that I have in that house is myself.\n",
      "Everything else can be replaced if I have the money to replace it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's a great answer.\n",
      "When you're going through your stuff, how do you decide when it's time to get rid of something?\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s very fascinating especially because a lot of the conversation that I’ve had with people about material hoarding, the clinicians will talk about as a problem of being able to distinguish between things that are valuable and things that are not valuable.\n",
      "So, they’ll keep everything indiscriminately because they can’t make that, they don’t have the ability to say “Okay, I don’t need to save this.”\n",
      "But it sounds like with animal hoarding there’s a lot more seeking out, so that maybe is a question I should ask you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think it’s possible that situations are not entirely terrible, because with animals it’s a very different thing to care for a dog than to care for a cat.\n",
      "For example, dogs have to go outside.\n",
      "If you don’t live somewhere where the dogs can, and you may have generated a point where the dogs poop all over the house.\n",
      "At some point if someone’s going to say “Gee, I’m going to take care of this kind of animal,” they have to be in a living situation that sort of (INAUDIBLE 33:13) something to that.\n",
      "So, then it sort of (INAUDIBLE 33:16) hard to take a cat to a park.\n",
      "You can fill it with cats pretty easy, dogs a little bit harder, but farm animals are much harder.\n",
      "On the flip side, if you have a farm (INAUDIBLE 33:20) running around just because there’s no barriers to entry.\n",
      "So, with certain living situations there are barriers to acquire a certain kind of animal.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, do you feel like that’s how people make the decision?\n",
      "They just acquire whatever they can and sometimes their limited in their acquisition?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t know if anybody actually knows, but I think my own personal opinion is people have an affiliation just like they do with pets.\n",
      "Some people are dog people, some people are cat people, some people are both and I don’t know if anybody really understands that’s a pretty innate kind of thing, you know who you fall in love with and that’s really what it’s all about.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it’s that kind of a question, it might just be what people prefer.\n",
      "That is very interesting.\n",
      "So, do you feel like, again this is a question that has come up for object hoarders, so some people see object hoarding as having negative associations with getting rid of things, so they feel bad when they throw things out.\n",
      "Whereas for other people it has more of a positive acquisition, you feel good when you get something.\n",
      "What is your sense of this with animal hoarding?\n",
      "Is it more of an inability to discard?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think both.\n",
      "But I don’t think discard and I think that’s one place where the comparison falls apart.\n",
      "If you’re truly going to think of discard as when you discard something it’s sort of worthless trash and I don’t think any of the people feel that their animals are “worthless trash.”\n",
      "So, if you want to say that it’s hard for them to put them in new homes, absolutely true, but I don’t think the parallel with object hoarding when you start using language like discard is appropriate.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s interesting.\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean it’s also a control issue too where if you’re a caregiver and your whole sort of (INAUDIBLE 35:20) is centered around being perceived as a caregiver and providing care, then you can’t provide care unless you have something that needs it.\n",
      "Speaker: Uh, what would this represent?\n",
      "Interviewer: I think that these are potential characters in this style.\n",
      "This wouldn’t be the character this would just be the style of animation.\n",
      "So this is the last one… So again I just want to hear if there is any style here that you guys like or don’t like.\n",
      "Speaker: Can I see the first one again?\n",
      "Interviewer: Of course.\n",
      "So you’ve got the comic art with live action, the vector art, and then the line art, which is live action with art and stuff sort of drawn around it.\n",
      "So, any elements you feel like you like or don’t like, style you like or don’t like.\n",
      "Any suggestions about it in general.\n",
      "Speaker: I like the comic book, the third one, the comic book blended.\n",
      "Interviewer: The comic art blended.\n",
      "Speaker: With, if you’re going with a certain target based off age, because Marvel the characters and stuff that’s out and about, you will hit kids who won’t care, won’t think about, won’t be interested, “that’s not going to help me” that kind of thing, that you may not get because that is a wide category kind of the preteen age that’ll be like you know “it’s not cool to have therapy” kind of thing, but this might be like “hey that’s kind of cool”.\n",
      "I think you might reach some of those boys or some characters that are like\n",
      "Interviewer: like preteen age.\n",
      "Speaker: I think that would be good for that/\n",
      "Interviewer: And again anything that you like or don’t like in general.\n",
      "Speaker: The uh I like this expect for I can see it carry toward boy rather than the boys and I would be concerned.\n",
      "If it this type of comic it could be a little dark.\n",
      "And I would be concerned with that.\n",
      "The second one um\n",
      "Interviewer: The vector art\n",
      "Speaker: yeah Um, these almost look to like childish\n",
      "Speaker: Right\n",
      "Speaker: You have something that’s interacting like this that you would have\n",
      "Interviewer: So like live action with characters, as well.\n",
      "Speaker: live action with characters would be, I think, a little bit more suitable on it.\n",
      "Speaker: Think that would probably go more with the general if you’re getting a big age gap, I think that one would hit both sides.\n",
      "For girls and boys.\n",
      "Speaker: And with all three, I don’t know what yawl’s target age wise is.\n",
      "I mean, I would think with the elementary age kids that this would be; where you’re getting both.\n",
      "And again I; there was other comic where I thought were more female friendly and not dark-looking.\n",
      "And it might be; the first one I thought, I personally…\n",
      "Interviewer: The line art\n",
      "Speaker: Unless, I personally think it’s distracting.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I don’t think it works with what the message would be about.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I’m having a little trouble with that one.\n",
      "There could be benefits for, in my view, the latter two.\n",
      "But I like the ones where there’s maybe a child in cartoons interacting with each other.\n",
      "Or where you would have a combination of those two.\n",
      "Or if there was something on the third one that could appeal to a wide enough audience\n",
      "Speaker: Not being a super character like a super hero character kind of thing, be more like a different a pet.\n",
      "Speaker: Because, you know, my daughter is and her friends and stuff are still into dolls and they’re not, they don’t follow any of the super heroes and stuff but my son on the other hand doesn’t want anything to do with dolls.\n",
      "Speaker: It is that way because I have a 10 year old son who’s like all into that and my 12 year old daughter is like “eh” you know, still dolls and stuff and what not.\n",
      "And you have to be, to make a video, you kind of have to be somewhere in the middle or you have a set base of boy girl kind of things, where kind of just do both and gear it toward the patient\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, um so what was your involvement in CBT for your kids and what would you think would be useful for other parents to know?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, I’ve been involved with our kinds as far as kind of the “brainstormer” to help figure out what challenges need to be addressed, to be the reminder to “you need to do this part of your therapy”, “this is what you need to do on a daily basis in case you forget”, to be somebody who is there to also help instigate some of the behavior to um to get it solved, sometimes you have to do something with the child in order to get the behavior to move forward you have to put them in a scenario.\n",
      "Like our son had um, being late for school really upset him so we purposely have been like ok I’m like 5 minutes late, you know two minutes late, five minutes late, you know twice a week so to like push him and you have to be part of the fixing process as a parent to go it’s gonna be ups and downs what you need to do but you have to do multiple steps to help the child sometimes because they’re children not adults they can’t do some of these things on their own that they have struggles with and anxieties, so you have to either put them in the scenario that makes them anxious and you look like being late or take them to a place or thing where it challenges them so they’re challenged enough but not too much.\n",
      "So it’s kind of all in a way caregiver as a parent, you’re that way as their anxiety brain CBT coach too ‘cause to push them from what you learned from your psychiatrist or psychologist or both.\n",
      "Um, but yet you have to regulate it so that they can move forward enough.\n",
      "Speaker: I like the description of it as a coach.\n",
      "Trying to encourage and uh, I’ve tried to help, you know debrief with her after her sessions and try understand what she has talked about and try to hold her accountable and to see if she’s doing her exercises, how often have you done the behavior, but try to do that in a nonthreatening and comfortable way for her so that she can feel comfortable telling me.\n",
      "You know if she’s done a behavior that she’s trying to avoid doing, I like the reference of coach because I can relate to that term.\n",
      "Speaker: Because we are, as parents, we all coach them in some way whether it’s manners, or behaviors or anxiety.\n",
      "Speaker: But you know, with a coach you can’t always encourage, you have to instruct.\n",
      "Speaker: Discipline\n",
      "Speaker: And help them to become disciplined and stuff so you know I like that term.\n",
      "Speaker: It could be a picture behind (laughter)\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Have you read or heard about any scientific research about CBT?\n",
      "And the second part of that is, is it something we should talk about in the videos?\n",
      "Would that be useful?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes I have heard and researched and read from books and or article through the internet and what not about CBT because it was, it’s the more knowledge you gain then you know better you use the tool, so to speak.\n",
      "I think it would be helpful to at least get a little snippet of statistics of how much success rate that you get with CBT that it would be like it this was proven through whatever studies that it is an option that does work and they have proof that it does so it’s like you should at least try it, because it’s not, it has a really good success rate for people living their lives.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "The way they want to live again.\n",
      "Interviewer: how anxiety can become a problem in someone’s life or um what’s important to know just for someone who is experiencing those things?\n",
      "Speaker: Its ok for you to get help.\n",
      "You don’t have to live with the fear.\n",
      "That fear that’s stalking or inside of you that feels so strong that’s going to overwhelm you every single day, you don’t have to live like that.\n",
      "You don’t have to feel that and it’s not bad and it’s not wrong to ask for help to to find that help or ask a trusted adult to help you find that adult that assistance.\n",
      "Interviewer: Awesome and so could you tell me any skills or specific areas that CBT targets.\n",
      "I know we talked about anxiety, but is there anything else that comes to mind.\n",
      "Speaker: Depression.\n",
      "I know um post-traumatic stress disorder is also kind of part of the anxiety but that helps as well.\n",
      "I don’t know the answer whether or not CBT can solve problems in people who are genetically predisposed which my kids are and I am due to my mom’s history.\n",
      "So there’s probably a psychiatric medicine type component that may need to be included and again there is no shame in that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah definitely and so would you say that it targets thoughts feelings and actions.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes\n",
      "Interviewer: And are there any questions you wished you would have asked before you started CBT or your daughter?\n",
      "Speaker: No I before... I was going through CBT before either of my kids started and I kind of landed to it not really knowing what it was and it’s probably what has saved my life.\n",
      "I grew up feeling suicidal the whole way through even as an adult.\n",
      "Even though I never actually did anything, I never wanted to be alive.\n",
      "CBT has helped me find more joy in everyday life and even though I still struggle and will probably continue struggling um I know I can choose not to let it overwhelm me.\n",
      "I have been given some tools to deal with the pain, the frustration, the anxiety, all of the things that are wound up in anxiety and depression.\n",
      "Interviewer: So would you say before starting it was really you… your question is what is this because you were going into not really knowing what to expect.\n",
      "Speaker: I interviewed several therapists and counselors beforehand and at the time I was faculty at UF.\n",
      "So I didn’t want someone who was affiliated with UF at first because I thought that it would be too humiliating and um I’ve had bad experiences with psychologists as a child.\n",
      "Um tried some family therapy and it was… it was too much anger, too much pain, and it didn’t do any good.\n",
      "I was afraid of the stigma of going to see someone for your mental health, not mental health, but for your emotional wellbeing.\n",
      "So really there was a women who incense burning in her room and she had Buddhist practically written everywhere and it was a big turn off and um you know the rooms here are comfortable.\n",
      "They are not beautifully decorated you know, but they’ve got nice pictures you know.\n",
      "You know that you are in a safe place and a safe... the people I’ve met here are patient and thoughtful, positive, and um just helpful so.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what is your involvement in your child’s overall CBT therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: So her counselor or her psychologist lately like for the last several visits has invited me into the sessions maybe for 10-15 minutes to let her know what I think should be covered because sometimes my daughter forgets mention certain things or just flat out doesn’t want to talk about it.\n",
      "I don’t know.\n",
      "So she tries to get my perspective first and then I leave and go back to the waiting area and then they can discuss things.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, let’s just talk through a couple of issues that pertain to object hoarding, but I want to hear you talk them through how you think they pertain specifically to cases of animal hoarding.\n",
      "So, you said that in the past these cases have been called animal collectors.\n",
      "So, for you, what is it that makes a distinction between someone who simply has a lot of animals, or who enjoys having a lot of animals, or who even collects animals if there were such a thing as an object collector, and somebody who is an animal hoarder.\n",
      "How do you make that distinction in your mind?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well that’s pretty much established in the research and that’s been laid out very clearly in terms of the definition that we used and looking at any of our work (INAUDIBLE 12:35) it is a multi-part sort of thing.\n",
      "Someone who has more than the typical number of animals, somebody who is keeping them under suboptimal or even inhumane conditions, somebody who doesn’t recognize their failure to provide proper care and they also persisted their behavior despite their failures.\n",
      "So, it kind of was a four-part definition.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, I guess I have a couple of sub-questions and I apologize this is not at all my, clearly I want to look at the literature, but I guess what I’m wondering is how you made calls like more than a typical number of animals.\n",
      "I mean do you ever have trouble because people are, for example living on a piece of land that’s really large and have something like a farm, but then have a lot of animals?\n",
      "Or is it always a really clear–\n",
      "Interviewee: Well that’s why the (INAUDIBLE 13:33) piece is only one piece of it.\n",
      "You can’t be hoarding animals if you have two dogs.\n",
      "If you got a problem of even neglect going on, but you can’t be talking about hoarding with (INAUDIBLE 13:45) you got to have some large-ish number.\n",
      "But the way you distinguish it from say a farming operation is because you’ve got again these substandard conditions, you’ve got people who are compulsive and desire to keep acquiring and controlling the animals (INAUDIBLE 14:05).\n",
      "There’s really no source of confusion with a farming operation.\n",
      "They’re pretty clear-cut.\n",
      "It doesn’t mean that something that looks like a farm couldn’t be hoarding because there are farm hoarders where again they do it with a large number of agriculture animals.\n",
      "There wouldn’t be any problems in the field I don’t think distinguishing it from using a four-part definition I’ve given, we never would have encountered any gray areas I don’t think, it’s pretty clear cut.\n",
      "You know people who are collectors, you know view what they are doing as a hobby and get a sense of enjoyment out of their collections and they like to engage in behavior around those kinds of possessions.\n",
      "You know when people have hoarding disorder, you know the behavior of saving tends not to bring them a whole lot of pleasure, I mean it may bring a sense of emotional comfort, but it’s not exactly fun for them.\n",
      "And they don’t really engage in the kinds of behaviors associated with collecting, they don’t really pick up their stuff and look at it and play with it, and do things with it.\n",
      "They mostly let it sit and collect dust in their homes.\n",
      "Interviewer: So just to repeat back to you what you said and make sure I file it correctly.\n",
      "There seems in your mind to be two main differences, one has to do with the degree of impairment, and by impairment in this case you mean inability to do very basic things in their home, correct?\n",
      "Or is there a different way you would define impairment?\n",
      "Interviewee: That inability to do basic things in the home as well as the ability to live safety in the home.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, it’s very kind of concretely linked to the home itself and their ability to exist in their home environment.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I think that’s a big piece of it.\n",
      "Interviewer: And then the second piece that you mentioned has to do with kind of the activities that go along with the saving behavior and the degree of enjoyment.\n",
      "Whereas for someone who is collector they use these things, they take pleasure in them where as someone with hoarding disorder doesn’t necessarily engage with the items once they have been acquired.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, and they don’t derive much of a sense of pleasure from their items.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so your sense is that a person with this disorder doesn’t get as much satisfaction out of their behavior as a collector.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I don’t think so.\n",
      "I think that they are often afraid to give up those things and they may feel a sense of comfort from having those possessions but I don’t think most of them would describe it as fun, you know which is really what collectors have to say.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s interesting, so it seems like in your mind this disorder then is much more linked to kind of obsessive compulsive spectrum where you are anxious about giving it up and maybe less related to something like compulsive gambling or compulsive shopping where you are actually enjoying the activity of acquiring, or is that not correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well there’s sort of two different pieces to hoarding.\n",
      "There is the acquiring and then there’s the saving.\n",
      "And those are two slightly different issues, and my response to the questions was largely around the issue of saving.\n",
      "I do tend to think that saving is often quite fear based, but I think the acquiring does have more to do with impulsivity where the person has a difficulty delaying gratification.\n",
      "As a result, when they see something that catches their eye they are not thinking critically about it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: So I think there is probably two processes that kick in and that’s why I think hoarding overlaps somewhat with the obsessive compulsive kind of disorders, but I also think it overlaps somewhat with the impulse control disorders.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah. So would you say it would be useful for parents to know to have open communication between the child and the therapist?\n",
      "To be patient and stuff like that.\n",
      "Speaker: And if they have concerns that the therapist needs to know about to make sure that they are not afraid to talk to the therapist or you know to just you know touch them on the shoulder or something and say can I talk to for just a minute.\n",
      "Tell me if I’m taking this the wrong way and it’s helpful for both the child and the parent.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah definitely.\n",
      "And have you read or heard any scientific research that has mentions CBT, and if so or if not do you think this something useful for us to mention in our videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Research on CBT.\n",
      "I don’t think I have which is unusual for me actually.\n",
      "Um would it be useful?\n",
      "It is always useful to back up what you say with research.\n",
      "You don’t necessarily need to say Millers, Smith, and Johnson at al. 1996 and their landmark study.\n",
      "You don’t have to cite it that way but in literature maybe suggest sources, reputable websites, and reputable sources of information whether it’s printed or electronic that parents and/or kids can look at.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: That’s always useful.\n",
      "Always whatever you do, I’m a scientist, you have to back up your claims otherwise its one person’s opinion versus another.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah definitely and did you know about anybody else’s experiences of CBT any time in your life?\n",
      "Speaker: No\n",
      "Interviewer: No, ok\n",
      "Speaker: I only… I landed into CBT myself actually because I voluntarily went to Vista for three days.\n",
      "I needed a time out because I was really going downhill fast so and um I actually found that I could help other people, other women who were struggling with suicidal thoughts.\n",
      "I didn’t know DBT, but I had some encouraging books that they could look at and things that were able to enhance sort of their view of themselves.\n",
      "Interviewer psychology stuff so.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so as I mentioned before we want to develop these video about CBT so we are kind of going to move on talking a little bit more detail about those.\n",
      "So, thinking about the video, who would be in the video in your perspective?\n",
      "What characters do you think we should include?\n",
      "Speaker: What ages groups are you targeting?\n",
      "Interviewer: So as of right now we are trying to make the video appeal to both the patients and their family so pretty much all age groups, but um yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: And is it just one video?\n",
      "Interviewer: As of right now.\n",
      "Speaker: Um and at what point where would you being showing it?\n",
      "Interviewer: So Ideally we would like… I mean it would be something that would be shown to patients and families right before they would start treatment to kind of better understand what they are going to be doing.\n",
      "Speaker: So not like a public service announcement type of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um no more so targeting people who are going into CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: Ok so an introduction to CBT.\n",
      "Um how long will it be?\n",
      "Interviewer: Um not sure.\n",
      "Probably not like 20 minutes.\n",
      "Probably something pretty concise, but enough information so people know what to expect.\n",
      "Speaker: So remind me your question.\n",
      "Interviewer: Who would be in the video?\n",
      "Speaker: Oh boy!\n",
      "Um in a world where everyone needs to be included, um you would have to involve some children maybe with different scenarios of how CBT is done.\n",
      "I would break it into… do you do CBT on a little kid?\n",
      "Interviewer: Um yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah I would say yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sorry to interrupt, what was going on in the house?\n",
      "Interviewee: It was just filled with cats, the water and electricity were turned off, every room was stacked to the (INAUDIBLE, 4:23) with cat cages, it was filthy, there was clutter everywhere, the cat cages some of them had groceries in them, sometimes with the cats, sometimes (INAUDIBLE, 4:35).\n",
      "It was an unlivable environment.\n",
      "The ladies allegedly were sleeping in a tent in the front yard while they had this hoard of cats inside.\n",
      "So, they were taken away finally by the police and hospitalized for observation or whatever, but that’s where the whole thing broke down and then at that point we were left with 72 cats and 13 dogs and didn’t know what to do.\n",
      "Nobody would talk to us, none of the clinicians would address it, they didn’t wanna deal with the animal fees and it was a very frustrating and difficult situation all the way around.\n",
      "So, fast forward another ten years when I was a faculty member I said well this is the time to start thinking about looking into this again and thinking about what the hell went on there.\n",
      "It can’t be the only case.\n",
      "This again is just an element of serendipity because people used to just call them animal collectors which seems like very poor terminology to me because they really weren’t (INAUDIBLE, 5:35-5:39) coin collectors, you know whatever.\n",
      "This was clearly not a benign hobby, this was pathological any way one looked at it from human wellness standpoint or from the animal standpoint.\n",
      "I started (INAUDIBLE, 5:53) and trying to see if I could find a comparable thing in literature and couldn’t.\n",
      "But then my mentor at (NAME 6:02) sort of got intrigued by this and he started doing some poking around and he found the literature on hoarding which was very comparable kind of behavior, it seemed to capture the pathology.\n",
      "In terms of serendipity, two of the top people in the country at that point who were really pioneering this work were (NAME 6:25) and (NAME 6:26) and they’re both local in Massachusetts.\n",
      "So I sent them copies and snippets of information and said, “You know I’ve got a video tape here of what this behavior looks like.\n",
      "I’ve never seen it described anywhere, would you guys be interested and coming and taking a look at it?” And they did.\n",
      "So that’s where it all began basically.\n",
      "We started to informally collaborate and share ideas and we started looking at this problem through the lens of human-object hoarding because that was the most pertinent way, the most pertinent out there in literature that seemed comparable as a window to explore it.\n",
      "So, we called it hoarding because it seems to have the same features, many of the same features, many of the same behaviors, sometimes you have both objects and animals hoarded as well, so lots of similarities certainly.\n",
      "It’s a fair question as to whether or not this is really the same behavior or a different behavior.\n",
      "I really don’t fully understand it, but up to this point at least it has been a useful thing, it’s been a useful lens to look at it.\n",
      "I think we’ve seen more similarities than differences.\n",
      "But, until the DSM came out it really wasn’t something that anybody really thought of as being connected with object hoarding and because DSM was very equivocal in mentioning it.\n",
      "They didn’t mention it because we were asked to submit some position papers saying why it should be included and their mention of it, I think, was a testament to the amount of work that we have done, but it certainly is not by any means a sufficient body of research.\n",
      "So, they kind of left it somewhat equivocal about where it sits.\n",
      "They had it listed as a specifier possibly, but they left it open and I think that was fair in the state of the research to leave it open as an unanswered question.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Okay, so I told you I had a friend at work, and we walked to her car.\n",
      "And I said, \"Oh my God,\" whatever her name is.\n",
      "I said, \"Oh my God, we need to clean your car.\"\n",
      "So the next day I told her to pull her car up behind from where we work, and we unloaded her car and we threw...\n",
      "She could hardly throw things away, but I made the decision for her what to throw away.\n",
      "And it was easy for me to throw her stuff away, because it was crappy.\n",
      "And she had a bit of a trauma, but I recognized it right away, when I saw her car.\n",
      "I said, \"Oh.\"\n",
      "Here's how it all started.\n",
      "I needed a ride.\n",
      "My car had broken down and I needed a ride just across about a half a mile away, and I asked her, \"Could you give me a ride?\" And she goes, \"No, I can't.\"\n",
      "And I said, \"Oh, you don't have your car?\" And she goes, \"Oh, I have my car.\"\n",
      "I said, \"That's okay, I'll make other arrangements.\n",
      "Maybe my ex will pick me up,\" and he did.\n",
      "So there was no problem there, but then when I walked her to her car I saw why she couldn't give a ride.\n",
      "Her car was stacked full of stuff.\n",
      "So that's when I made her come back the next day, and all those people who try to make me clear out my stuff, including my ex, I did the same thing to her.\n",
      "So I can do it to other people, but people can't do it to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Who else has tried to get you to throw away some stuff, aside from your ex.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Oh, my stepmother.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your stepmother.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "My stepmother didn't try, she just threw everything out.\n",
      "One day I came home from school and everything was thrown away.\n",
      "Everything except-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How did that make you feel?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "... my clothes.\n",
      "Oh my God.\n",
      "So in the middle of the night, I woke up and I snuck down to the garbage can and retrieved a few of the things I really wanted.\n",
      "So I couldn't retrieve everything, because then she would figure out I took everything back, right?\n",
      "But I then had to hide things.\n",
      "Then I had to hide it from her.\n",
      "I had to hide it in a special box in my closet.\n",
      "I'm sure she looked through that, but she didn't...\n",
      "When she threw it away, she didn't go through it at all.\n",
      "She just emptied the drawers in the garbage.\n",
      "She didn't know what was in there.\n",
      "So when I organized the stuff and put it in a special box she didn't throw that away, because she didn't know it was the stuff she had thrown away, it's just now organized neatly in a box, right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "So I-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Oh, sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer: And are there any questions you wished you would have asked before you started CBT or your daughter?\n",
      "Speaker: No I before... I was going through CBT before either of my kids started and I kind of landed to it not really knowing what it was and it’s probably what has saved my life.\n",
      "I grew up feeling suicidal the whole way through even as an adult.\n",
      "Even though I never actually did anything, I never wanted to be alive.\n",
      "CBT has helped me find more joy in everyday life and even though I still struggle and will probably continue struggling um I know I can choose not to let it overwhelm me.\n",
      "I have been given some tools to deal with the pain, the frustration, the anxiety, all of the things that are wound up in anxiety and depression.\n",
      "Interviewer: So would you say before starting it was really you… your question is what is this because you were going into not really knowing what to expect.\n",
      "Speaker: I interviewed several therapists and counselors beforehand and at the time I was faculty at UF.\n",
      "So I didn’t want someone who was affiliated with UF at first because I thought that it would be too humiliating and um I’ve had bad experiences with psychologists as a child.\n",
      "Um tried some family therapy and it was… it was too much anger, too much pain, and it didn’t do any good.\n",
      "I was afraid of the stigma of going to see someone for your mental health, not mental health, but for your emotional wellbeing.\n",
      "So really there was a women who incense burning in her room and she had Buddhist practically written everywhere and it was a big turn off and um you know the rooms here are comfortable.\n",
      "They are not beautifully decorated you know, but they’ve got nice pictures you know.\n",
      "You know that you are in a safe place and a safe... the people I’ve met here are patient and thoughtful, positive, and um just helpful so.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what is your involvement in your child’s overall CBT therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: So her counselor or her psychologist lately like for the last several visits has invited me into the sessions maybe for 10-15 minutes to let her know what I think should be covered because sometimes my daughter forgets mention certain things or just flat out doesn’t want to talk about it.\n",
      "I don’t know.\n",
      "So she tries to get my perspective first and then I leave and go back to the waiting area and then they can discuss things.\n",
      "Interviewer: Awesome and what would be useful for other parents to know that maybe have a child that is about to go into CBT or is in CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Be patient.\n",
      "Love your child no matter what.\n",
      "Sometimes we are the cause of some of their problems and we don’t realize it and hopefully the therapist or the counselor would let us know somehow.\n",
      "Although there have been certain times where I would say something or do something I meant it in a way to keep my child safe or I’m trying to protect her from something, but she doesn’t have that perspective.\n",
      "She feels like she is being restricted or um that I’m being mean to her and so her counselor knew after talking with me individually sometimes with my daughter in the therapy and me out in a separate room quickly, I would let her know what my perspective was and she knew I wasn’t trying to be a jerk.\n",
      "I was trying to do the right thing for my child.\n",
      "So that helped her be able to help my daughter realize that I was coming from a place of concern and she was possibly you know you got let the child feel the way they are going to feel, but help them realize that the parent has a different view of things and has different experiences and is trying to be helpful.\n",
      "It opens up communication between the parent and the child.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, exactly right.\n",
      "So that was part of the reason of kind of branching out and trying to talk to people who might be seeing [cuts off].\n",
      "Interviewee: Let me give you just a tad bit of background on this too–\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewee: –because again whether this even fits in this is a separate issue, I think, rather an important one.\n",
      "The reason we got started on this, this whole sort of research effort began, was because I had encountered as a shelter director when I was a shelter, I’m a veterinarian by training and I was a running a small animal shelter outside of Philadelphia.\n",
      "We also invested cases of animal neglect or abuse and mistreatment.\n",
      "So, we got this call to go visit and look into this house and the call was made by the Pizza Hut.\n",
      "These two ladies, the complaint was that there were two ladies eating out of their dumpster and bringing the food into the Pizza Hut to eat and then going back to their house to sort of tucked off the street a little bit behind the Pizza Hut.\n",
      "So, they weren’t really concerned about the ladies at all, but they were very concerned about the ladies bringing the thrown away Pizza Hut food back into the Pizza Hut and the nature of the complaint and the reason they called us was because they said well (INAUDIBLE, 3:35) and there’s dog problem here.\n",
      "So they wrote this into doing something maybe they couldn't get anybody else to look into it, maybe other people have blown them off which is not uncommon, but they found us so we looked into it from a (INAUDIBLE, 3:51) perspective.\n",
      "When we got there and finally got into the house and met the ladies, we saw what was going on and we were just dumbfounded.\n",
      "We had never seen anything like this in our lives and it didn’t have a name and just didn’t know how to deal with it and basically got blown off by everybody that we tried to talk to about it.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "My papers, everything papers I spend a lot of time with.\n",
      "I put away my crystal vase, so I never see that but I know I have it.\n",
      "I put away the really nice things.\n",
      "I sorted my dad's photos, so I have those, but my papers, I'm always shuffling and going through, \"Okay, what can I look at?\" I'm also, like I said, a voracious reader, and a lot of times I didn't have stuff to read, so I always want something to read, you know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I also, by the way, I steal magazines out of doctor's offices, so I have something to read.\n",
      "And I don't steal them to steal them, I steal them to read.\n",
      "It's so funny.\n",
      "Do I need more paper to take home?\n",
      "No, but if I've got five minutes I want to read, and I want to read something that I think is useful.\n",
      "I don't read fiction.\n",
      "I only read non-fiction, and I've got to have something to read that's useful, that I can use to expand my mind.\n",
      "By the way, cookbooks actually do that.\n",
      "Ooh, if I took it, sort of a chemistry experience.\n",
      "\"Gee, I don't like this ingredient, what could I substitute, and boy, how's it taste afterward?\" I used to have a lot of dinner parties, but now I don't have that anymore, so yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When talking and distinguishing between hoarding disorder, what would you consider the most important difference between normal saving behavior, like collecting items, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "When it becomes unmanageable and-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Unmanageable.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah, unmanageable.\n",
      "So there's a line where you collect maybe baby elephant statues.\n",
      "But if you cannot overrun your house because you now have 57,000 baby statues and you're breaking them, and you're...\n",
      "In fact, sometimes I want to break items so I don't, like that spice container.\n",
      "I actually want to break it.\n",
      "I can't throw it away whole, because now if it's broken, I can never use it, so-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you do this with any items, as a way to-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah, I try to break things to get them out of my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So I know we discussed how to identify some people with hoarding disorder earlier.\n",
      "You mentioned different signs.\n",
      "So if you were to identify someone with hoarding disorder without being in their home, do you think that you would be able to do that, and what would you look for?\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "I mean it’s tricky because if you then challenge somebody with hoarding disorder about their possessions and say, why don’t you throw this old soda can away?\n",
      "Then they will say its valuable, you know in some way.\n",
      "I don’t know if that was the actual reason they were saving it in the first place, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think the reasons people give when you push them are not necessarily the actual reasons they are doing it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right and that’s a question I was actually going to ask you later is: whether you feel the explanations are kind of post doc reasons to justify an underlying pathological need or if kind of the hoarding reasoning or thought processes is what came first or if the thought process is a product of them just justifying what they are doing?\n",
      "Interviewee: I love that question.\n",
      "I have friendly disagreements with my colleagues around this issue.\n",
      "I think my gut reaction is that this is all post talk reasoning.\n",
      "I think that people hang onto things and I think they are compelled to save things for reasons they themselves don’t fully understand.\n",
      "I don’t think the average hoarder truly knows why her does what he/she does.\n",
      "I think that if you push them and you try to get them to throw something away then they will tell you a spec of plausible sounding story about.\n",
      "But I don’t think a plausible sounding story was the actual reason they saved it in the first place.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So, for you it’s a behavior that they do and then they watch themselves doing it and then they come up with reasons why they’ve done it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I mean, I tend to think of hoarding a little more behaviorally and neurobiologically rather than cognitively as some of my colleagues do.\n",
      "Interviewer: That was going to be my follow up is you could imagine two reasons why people are doing things that they don’t understand why they are doing and one is a biological explanation which is that their brain is wired that way and the others is more kind of like a physiological explanation which is that they have unconscious desires that they don’t necessarily have access to?\n",
      "But it sounds like you kind of got on the biological side of that.\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean I am all for the psychological explanation but I don’t think that that necessarily means that I am conscious that there are things that I am aware of.\n",
      "I mean I tend not to draw much of a bright line between biology and psychology, it’s just they are different expressions of the same thing.\n",
      "But if you think biologically for a minute, you know we know that when people have hoarding disorder and they are looking at a possession and they have to make a decision that they’re saline’s network goes haywire.\n",
      "And they get frozen and they can’t make a decision and then they save the thing.\n",
      "And then you can ask them later why did you save it and they will say I didn’t want to waste it or something like that, but you know I suspect that really the reason they saved it and the thing that they can’t quite put their finger on is they couldn’t throw it away because their saline network was so active it overloads the funnel of the more logical part of their brain.\n",
      "That’s not the sort of thing that most of us can self-report on.\n",
      "But again, it’s tricky because for a lot of the things that you or I own we might very well feel distressed if we might very well feel distressed if we had to get rid of some of them.\n",
      "But, you know at least when the hoarding case is more clear that level of distress is far more acute then makes sense, then you or I would expect to feel.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you find that, so we are going to get into the next section of the interview that is all about insight.\n",
      "So, kind of to lead into that, do you find that when your patients have what we would call low insight that they deny stress associated with discarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: That they aren’t even aware of how they would feel if they had to discard?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, let me take that back.\n",
      "I don’t know about that.\n",
      "I think when I see low insight patients I think they don’t think they have a problem with saving.\n",
      "And they think that everything is fine but I think they still exhibit both verbally and sometimes non-verbally a heightened anxiety or anger or sadness response when they have to let go of something.\n",
      "Interviewer: Let’s take a step back before we get into this discussion about insight.\n",
      "As I’m sure you know a lot of literatures sort of describe hoarding disorders as having low insight or have problems getting into treatment because of insight.\n",
      "How would you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would define insight according to three different variables.\n",
      "And I think there are probably three separate constructs.\n",
      "The first is anosognosia, and anosognosia which mostly is the kind of [inaudible 23:49] insight you see in neurological disorders is where the person fails to recognize that there is a deficit.\n",
      "AND that’s a very common kind of poor insight we see in hoarding, those are the non-treatment seeking hoarders that are often referred through the courts or other branches of social services.\n",
      "The second kind of poor insight is called overvalued ideation, and that’s the kind of hoarding insight you might see in OCD or perhaps more commonly in schizophrenia.\n",
      "So, in overvalued ideation the person is aware they have an illness and at the same time they also believe everything they think is right.\n",
      "The third kind of poor insight, I just refer to as defensiveness, because I think of some of the behaviors we refer to as being low insight are really just a person trying to get you off their back.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, they may be aware that they have a problem but just not want to deal with it?\n",
      "Interviewee: They don’t want to acknowledge it to you because they don’t want to deal with it.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you find that with your patients that any of these are more or less common?\n",
      "I mean which do you see most often?\n",
      "Are they mutually exclusive?\n",
      "Interviewee: They are not mutually exclusive.\n",
      "I think the ones that I see the most often are the overvalued ideation and the defensiveness.\n",
      "But there is a reason for that and that is because I think the people with anosognosia are not the ones that come in for treatment, and I am less likely to meet them.\n",
      "Although I suspect there is probably a lot of them out there.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "It was good.\n",
      "I got some pointers and some of the things I still do but it's sort of like something that because what I find is if I can get one habit right now, I never usually have to struggle finding my kids anymore because I have a sub.\n",
      "So if I can find a pattern of being then it seems to keep me on the straight and narrow.\n",
      "Some of the things I've picked up, I felt were really good.\n",
      "It's just like if but that particular class was taken over by somebody who I was being in treatment at the same time I was in the group.\n",
      "So I felt like I could have progressed faster, but she took up a lot of the time or it's like, she had an excuse for not getting better.\n",
      "And so we spent a lot of times talking about her and her inability to throw away things.\n",
      "And even though it was progress, it was very detrimental to her own self.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it ended up being kind of group therapy for her rather than for everyone.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But the people did try to encourage her that she did need to seek help outside of the group for the issues that were stopping her from even hearing what they were trying to tell.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And she kind of derailed the group overall and that hurt your experience.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So it ended up where it was just me and her and the two counselors.\n",
      "And two people just dropped out, but one person I don't think dropped out because of her, but the other one, I'm pretty sure did.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you talk a little bit about how you think that your hoarding problems have impacted your life socially?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Most of my friends either I've told them or they have seen it progressed enough where they understand why they can't come over.\n",
      "And it's sort of one of those things where I feel like certain people, I definitely can't share or can't.\n",
      "I have to try to figure out a way that they can't find out because of things that they've said.\n",
      "I know that they would not see me the same or either want to continue to be my friends, if that makes sense.\n",
      "So I used to be a very social person where I used to love to have parties and things like that.\n",
      "And that has changed the part of me where I don't have those things that I used to have.\n",
      "But I'm not lacking in friends or friendship.\n",
      "It's just depends on what's going on and whether I'm just trying to survive as opposed to just get better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Whether you really feel up to it.\n",
      "Sure if you feel up to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I imagine that must have been difficult.\n",
      "If you had to choose between certain items, like say in that case, when he wanted you to de-clutter.\n",
      "How would you decide...\n",
      "Or the vases, when you mentioned having a lot.\n",
      "How would you decide which one you would keep?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Well at that time I couldn't decide, mind was shut down, there was nothing going.\n",
      "And in fact too, there's lots of...\n",
      "My stepmother passed away and she said some awful things in her will.\n",
      "Then for 10 years I haven't moved a thing.\n",
      "So from 2010 until this last year when I fell, and probably let go of some of my stepmother's thoughts, I hadn't done anything.\n",
      "I just let it pile up and pile up and pile up, where it was getting to the point where I had no room.\n",
      "So I just decided after the fall last year that I needed room, and that I just needed to let go of some of my thoughts, and then it became a little bit easier to let of some of the stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Detaching from your thoughts was helpful?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, and after that argument with my ex, I didn't let anything go.\n",
      "In fact, we probably broke up, I kept my stuff and I started hoarding more to where the point is, like I said.\n",
      "There was no kitchen space, there was no stair space, there was nothing.\n",
      "Everything was piled 10 feet high with papers and clothes, and it was just tough.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You mentioned that you fell.\n",
      "Did the clutter contribute to your fall recently?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "No, no, no. I fell at work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You fell at work?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the space, can you please describe the space that you live in now, and what it's like?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "The space I live in now?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Are you still in the same place you mentioned earlier, with the upstairs and the downstairs?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, I've been there 20 years, right?\n",
      "Remember, this is the house I bought bigger to replace the smaller house so I could store more stuff, right?\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How much bigger is this house?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Well, it is a lot bigger.\n",
      "I used to live in a two bedroom, one bathroom little tiny house, and now I live in a four bedroom, three bathroom, upstairs, downstairs, basement.\n",
      "Huge yard.\n",
      "And it did get quite full, I'm telling you.\n",
      "But again, since the fall things have had to change.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are you living there alone still?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah, now I am, although I'm still friendly with my ex.\n",
      "He's coming over...\n",
      "Well here's something.\n",
      "My pruning shears broke, and I'm deciding to throw away, they're broken, and I'm deciding to throw them away.\n",
      "Now I have no personal attachment to them, and I'm hoping I'm able to throw them away, but they're sitting on the counter near the garbage.\n",
      "But they haven't been thrown away, and he's bringing me another pair, so we'll see what I do with those pruning shears, the broken ones.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any rooms in your home that you aren't able to use because they're full of clutter?\n",
      "Interviewer: Along the same lines of thinking about the difference between somebody who is exhibiting kind of normal saving behavior and somebody with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Can you think of a specific case or cases that you encountered either clinically or in research where you felt it was challenging to diagnosis someone because they were either exhibiting either unusual kinds of behaviors or they were right on that boarder line between clinical and subclinical?\n",
      "Interviewee: So, you are asking me if I can identify a case where it was not clear whether it was clinical or not?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, can you think of a person where it was a difficult call to say whether were exhibiting a variant of normal behavior or if they truly had hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, sure.\n",
      "I can think of a few people like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you encounter cases like that how do you make that distinction, what really makes the difference for you?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think what really makes the difference for me is the degree of functional impairment.\n",
      "So, the question really becomes, in the case I’m thinking about, the questions was very much is this person just messy and or they truly engaging in hoarding?\n",
      "And for me it came down largely to try and understand the degree of impairment that was present in the home.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how do comorbid diagnosis kind of figure into that problem or do they make it harder or easier in terms of really saying that somebody’s behavior is hoarding behavior?\n",
      "So, things like [inaudible 06:57].\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it makes it harder because you know with the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, not only do all these symptoms have to be present but then you also have to be able to state with some certainty that the behaviors are not the result of some other mental disorder.\n",
      "And you know if you are looking at something like let’s say clutter in the home there are lots of different mental disorders that can cause that, depression being probably first and foremost among them.\n",
      "You know if you are looking at difficulty organizing and making decisions a lot things can do that for example attention deficit disorder.\n",
      "And so, when a person has comorbid psychiatric conditions I think you have this difficulty in which not only trying to separate out whether this behavior is clinical or subclinical you are also trying to determine whether the behavior can be attributed to that other mental disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: So that’s kind of the calculus’s.\n",
      "Is there something else going on?\n",
      "Do you find that that’s more common than is normal or abnormal?\n",
      "Is that the more common problem, is which disorder is it and not is this clinical or subclinical?\n",
      "Interviewee: I’d say those are probably tied.\n",
      "I think they are both really important and tricky clinical dilemmas.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So now kind of continuing to think about making the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, I’d like you to talk through with me some of the DSM 5 criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So how severe would you say that this collecting behavior is now?\n",
      "In other words, do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I don't feel like I'm getting more stuff in, to tell the truth.\n",
      "It's like I just can't get the stuff that's here out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you just-\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I don't feel like-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... you have a hard time parting with things.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, mostly with that.\n",
      "The collecting with the agates, they're tiny.\n",
      "They're in jars, so they're organized.\n",
      "They're not on the floor or anything like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "But the other stuff, old stuff, my old memories are very hard.\n",
      "Both my parents passed away within the last two years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, and I've actually ...\n",
      "So I acquired ...\n",
      "But unlike my brothers, who just sifted through and just picked a couple things, I ended up taking boxes of stuff back home.\n",
      "So now I have their stuff in addition to mine.\n",
      "It's very hard to not feel like I'm throwing them out when I throw out their stuff.\n",
      "My sister also died.\n",
      "She died in 2000, but my mom kept her stuff.\n",
      "She made a point to tell me that I was supposed to keep it to.\n",
      "So even though she didn't like that I hoarded books, she wanted me to keep the stuff to kind of ...\n",
      "None of the stuff is heirloom or anything like that.\n",
      "Some of the stuff is in really shabby shape and really can't do much with it.\n",
      "But I almost feel like this obligation to keep it in the family, which my son said, when I die, this whole place is probably going to go up in smoke.\n",
      "He doesn't need the house and he doesn't need ... I try to actually clean things out because I don't want him to have to just take a big dumpster and just toss everything.\n",
      "I'm trying.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's definitely ...\n",
      "What I'm hearing from you is that it's definitely the memories that make it hard, the sentimentality of not wanting to throw away your relatives in a sense.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, but then it's more than that because, when I try to throw things out, I look at each item separately.\n",
      "Even if it's not functional, I think can I fix it?\n",
      "Can I reuse it, recycle it?\n",
      "Does someone else need it?\n",
      "I go through all these different processes with each thing, unless I'm in a mood where, like I said, the trash is going to be coming.\n",
      "I'm just like, okay, it's been here long enough.\n",
      "It's got to go.\n",
      "If I do it quickly and get it right into the trash the day before or the night before, and I can't go back in it or take it out.\n",
      "If I could do that and get that motivation, I can get stuff cleared out, and I feel so much better when I do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. That’s good to know.\n",
      "Well, if there’s nothing else, thank you so much for your time and your feedback and for taking the time out to do this interview with us.\n",
      "It’s really appreciated.\n",
      "Speaker: Thank you!\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, thank you so much for meeting with us today.\n",
      "I’m working with a group of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists on a project about cognitive behavior therapy and the kind of therapy your daughter has been doing, and for this project we want to develop a short educational video that would describe this type of therapy and give a little more insight to patients and family to what they can expect from cognitive behavior therapy.\n",
      "Also, cognitive behavior therapy is pretty long so throughout I’m just going to shorten it to CBT.\n",
      "So to start can you tell me what comes to mind when you think of CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: A therapist or psychologist talking with the adolescent about, or even an adult, about ways to handle different stressors um so… um it’s something that helps to reframe how a child sees or experiences what they think is a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, definitely so helping them handle certain stressors and kind of reframing their cognition and could you tell me what you know about CBT in your own words.\n",
      "What would you explain what it is?\n",
      "Speaker: Can you restate the question.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes, so in your own words if you had to provide a definition of what CBT is, what would you say that it is?\n",
      "I know kind of what you mentioned is what comes to mind to you is kind of a good definition.\n",
      "You know kind of summarize that.\n",
      "Speaker: Narrow it down.\n",
      "Cognitive behavior therapy would be… not supposed to say the same word in the definition.\n",
      "Therapy or meeting one-on-one with a CBT trained specialist or psychologist with a patient um and to try to change behavior by thinking of things in a different way.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, ok awesome!\n",
      "And when you first learned about this type of therapy that we do here, do you remember if you had any questions or if there was something specific you wanted to know about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Well, I also have gone through considerable CBT therapy so when it came time for my daughter to um go through it as well I didn’t hesitate to put her in it because I knew it was something that worked.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah so from personal experience you didn’t really have any questions.\n",
      "You kind of knew what to expect.\n",
      "Speaker: Right.\n",
      "Well for… I didn’t know what to expect for her specifically.\n",
      "So it’s been interesting to watch the changes happen.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, and how much did you know about CBT from movies, the media, TV, other people, and if so did this match yours or your child’s experience?\n",
      "Speaker: So would this involve mindfulness as well or...?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Ok.\n",
      "I mean I can think of a Star Trek movie that indicated being in the moment and how I can relate that to slowing down time and getting things to work differently or better.\n",
      "Say the question one more time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah um so how much did you learn or hear about CBT from movies, TV, internet, media, any of those outside sources?\n",
      "Speaker: Um there… I’m a Interviewer so there are a couple of Interviewer songs that indicate breathing techniques you know slow down, appreciate where you are, and take a breath, or take a deep breath and hold on.\n",
      "So songs definitely, movies a couple of movies specifically that Start Trek one I don’t remember the name of it.\n",
      "It was with Jean Picard.\n",
      "Um TV, I don’t watch TV much so I cants say much to that um and most people do not talk about therapy so I can’t say that it was anything from what someone said.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um so what was described in the Star Trek movie and some of the songs you heard?\n",
      "Do those thing being described match yours and your daughter’s experiences with CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Part of it yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. How important are your items for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Pretty important.\n",
      "Yeah, my agates.\n",
      "I guess it's hard when ...\n",
      "Well, the books, I really have to have the books around.\n",
      "I like to have those.\n",
      "I do actually reread books.\n",
      "Some books I just have that I haven't read yet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So which items do you feel you spend the most time with?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Probably the books and my rock collection.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So are there any parts of your home that you don't use?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, there's one room that was my computer room, and that's the room that I'm working on.\n",
      "I've just been working on this last week.\n",
      "It's got my books and papers, things I can't part with like memorabilia from trips I took, photographs.\n",
      "I can get from the door to the computer, and then it's a very narrow kind of corridor.\n",
      "So that room, if some people come, I just close that door, close it totally off.\n",
      "The living room looks okay, except now stuff from that room is kind of filtering into there because I have boxes to get rid of but, because nothing is open anymore, I can't get rid of them anymore, like the thrift store or anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Because I have books in there I don't use, I'm just going to give away.\n",
      "So right now it's kind of hard because, with me, it's usually if I put them in the box and get them in the car, I can get rid of them.\n",
      "But getting it to those points are the tricky part.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just trying to get it-\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Getting them out of the house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, out of the space.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Because I'll look in there again and I'll be like, well do I really want to get rid of that?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Maybe I should keep that in case someone needs it.\n",
      "It's like, no, it's so old that it's not even ...\n",
      "It's a science book.\n",
      "It's not even ...\n",
      "Those things aren't even true anymore.\n",
      "They're outdated.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's outdated, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Some of this stuff is just ... yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So are there any parts of your home that aren't used in the intended way, other than your computer room that you use more for storage?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "No. The bathroom is clear, the kitchen is clear, the bedrooms are clear.\n",
      "I'm able to use all those.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now I'm going to ask you a couple of questions about what makes things valuable to you and what do you consider things to be trash.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you think about your own possessions, I know you've mentioned memories of your family members and your books.\n",
      "So when you think about your own possessions, what else makes them valuable?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, that is very interesting.\n",
      "So, part of it is this identity of being a person who is a caregiver so identifying oneself as kind of like a good person because they’re taking care of so many dogs and cats, it’s a personal identity.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: So I’m wondering, do people who are hoarding animals also hoard objects?\n",
      "Do you find that when you go into the home it’s cluttered and their car is full of stuff and also they have seventy-two cats?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well again, it depends on how one defines the term hoarding because there’s a difference between just the accumulation of stuff in my mind versus, because they just didn’t throw it out like there’s piles of trash in the kitchen and old food, unsanitary conditions, very crowded, but they never deliberately said “Oh, I want to collect (INAUDIBLE 36:29).”\n",
      "It’s just a (INAUDIBLE 36:31) of life they haven’t disposed of.\n",
      "What was that question about again?\n",
      "I sort of lost track.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do people who hoard animals also hoard objects?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, so you will see certainly when you come into some of these places and again there’s a range of things, so sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes what you see is tons and tons of old pet food, bags of dog food, bags of cat food, empty cans of cat food, empty cans of dog food, you know litter bags, etc. So some of it is the (INAUDIBLE 37:08) of having animals and I don’t know that they’re hoarding that, they just don’t throw it away and that’s just how their lives are organized.\n",
      "They’re hoarding the animals, but the other stuff is just sort of a byproduct of that.\n",
      "But then we have also seen cases where along with the animals they do have other stuff.\n",
      "Like the very first case I was telling you, they had a lot of religious iconography and a lot of Christmas decorations.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting.\n",
      "Interviewee: There was another case where we walked into the “shelter” and there was stall after stall after stall filled with chandeliers.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting.\n",
      "Interviewee: So, yeah you see both.\n",
      "You walk into some places and you see stuff that’s just the (INAUDIBLE 37:54) of animals and you walk into other places and you see other stuff there, you know coo-coo clocks, you know whatever it might be and it’s like wow how do you meld these two things together?\n",
      "And then there’s another case where we walked in and it was literally almost an empty house with various furniture and some cats.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it doesn’t tend to be like you know when you talk about object hoarders, like just a jumble of indiscriminate objects?\n",
      "It sounds like with animal hoarders a lot of times they have collections.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, it can be all of the above is all I’m saying.\n",
      "I don’t know if you can characterize it as one or the other.\n",
      "Some of it is accidental, what I call accidental hoarding, because they just haven’t thrown anything out.\n",
      "They feed the cat, they empty the cat food can, they throw it over their shoulder.\n",
      "Is that hoarding?\n",
      "I mean it looks like hoarding, but is that the same thing as some of the other objects.\n",
      "I don’t know the answer to that question.\n",
      "It’s qualitatively different than walking in and thinking, “Wow, where did you get all of these chandeliers?” They had to do some work to get the chandeliers, that took some real effort to fill all sorts of chandeliers.\n",
      "Interviewer: And prior to that, it hadn’t been in any previous editions of the DSM at all.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh god no. Well, hoarding disorder.\n",
      "At that point, it was listed hoarding was dealt with under OCD, because of the way it was described earlier.\n",
      "The original sample of people who were hoarding were people who felt presented to OCD clinics, with OCD hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And at that point people didn’t realize that there was OCD hoarding, but that was only a minority of the hoarding behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: So, that’s the short history.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, tell me about your work developing the research on animal hoarding.\n",
      "Tell me about what your next steps were and how and if you’ve been able to build a body of literature.\n",
      "How do you find animal hoarders?\n",
      "What does your research look like in this topic right now?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well we’re not doing anything now.\n",
      "Our group worked together collectively for about ten years and then everybody, you know time passes and you know it sort of finished our joint work.\n",
      "People change jobs, one person passed away, that sort of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, how many cases did you end up seeing while you were working on this topic?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well again it depends on what you mean by cases.\n",
      "The hard consortium didn’t actually quote-on-quote seek patients.\n",
      "We, this was an informal research group and we studied it through a variety of different lenses.\n",
      "So, we talked about cases, we shared ideas about (INAUDIBLE 10:29), we shared thoughts about treatment.\n",
      "But everybody was doing their own thing (INAUDIBLE 10:36) information sharing.\n",
      "So, (NAME 10:38) and (NAME 10:39) were studying object hoarders, but then they were bringing their insights about object hoarding to us.\n",
      "We would weigh in, we would talk about how does this seem to fit, does it fit, does it not fit, what are we (INAUDIBLE 10:54) questions.\n",
      "So, everybody had their own sort of angle of researcher thing that they brought to the general discussion.\n",
      "In terms of me personally the way I saw cases, again I was working, well not at that point I wasn’t, but I still do see a lot of people in the animal shelter world doing investigations.\n",
      "So, when they would get a report of a case et cetera, et cetera then often they would bring those cases to our attention and we would either do case reports or talk to the investigators, there was a few times we would go out on active cases, so it would just vary.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, you kind of would see them in the course of talking to people and your job as a veterinarian.\n",
      "Interviewee: I would see them as the course of a law enforcement investigation basically.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so you would be called in at that point.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Right, family objects.\n",
      "Very expensive items like jewelry.\n",
      "Family objects, and the more pretty things.\n",
      "When I say more pretty things, so if I have 25 vases, and 22 of them are the standard florist vases, but one of them is a Baccarat crystal, I want to keep the Baccarat crystal.\n",
      "But I can-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you get rid of the other vases?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Well, and that's what I'm trying to do now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I'm looking at them, and that's my probably right now, is I can only tackle one item.\n",
      "I try to do one item a day.\n",
      "I try.\n",
      "It doesn't always work.\n",
      "And my last thing, my worst hoarding object is paper.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What kind of paper?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Newspaper, personal notes, like you told me to make this list, right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "So now I'm going to keep this list for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks.\n",
      "I dated it, already have it here.\n",
      "I want to look at it.\n",
      "I will keep paper.\n",
      "I have paper in my house, I found a note that was 34 years old.\n",
      "By the way, I found canned crab that was 44 years old, they used to date them, from Walgreens.\n",
      "A note.\n",
      "So it wasn't busted or anything, and I opened it.\n",
      "I said, \"Oh, you're not going to eat this.\"\n",
      "But I opened it just to see what a 44-year-old can of crab looked like.\n",
      "But I'm a great paper saver.\n",
      "Even though there's computers, I have to save a lot of paper, and even my taxes.\n",
      "I've got 50 years of taxes.\n",
      "What am I going to do?\n",
      "I have to figure, nobody's going to care what happened in 1970.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So all of these papers, why do you consider them valuable?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Because I haven't read them.\n",
      "There might be something important that I need to know.\n",
      "Oh, that may be another reason.\n",
      "I was not educated properly and people used to make fun of me, so I self-educated.\n",
      "And so now I spend all my time reading everything, in case I miss something that might be useful to me, and I do throw it away once I've gathered the information.\n",
      "However, I do have over a thousand cookbooks so, and I just love cookbooks.\n",
      "They're like reading material for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So if you lost any of these papers and you hadn't had a chance to read them, because it sounds like once you have consolidated the information, that is when you decide to throw it away, would that be correct?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So if you-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "But if I read an article that I think I need, I keep it.\n",
      "So you could imagine.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, can you hear me now?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes, I can hear you now, sorry about that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay, that’s weird.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I don’t know what that was.\n",
      "Interviewee: All good?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah good.\n",
      "So, you oversee the clinic, sorry.\n",
      "Interviewee: I oversee that hoarding treatment protocol and provide patient treatment for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So, you both see patients clinically and you are involved in research in hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Is that correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t see very many patients clinically.\n",
      "Mostly I oversee the protocol, I supervise the treatment [inaudible 12:22-12:30].\n",
      "Interviewer: I am really sorry, I keep losing you and I am not sure if the issue is on my end or if it’s on your end.\n",
      "Would you like me to try calling you back?\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Can you hear me okay?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, it’s very strange you go out completely and then you go back completely.\n",
      "Are you in a place where that could be from your end?\n",
      "Or is it from my end?\n",
      "I can try calling you back if that would be helpful?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t know.\n",
      "Yeah, I am on a cell phone in a car so that could be part of what’s...\n",
      "Interviewer: You want me to try giving you a call back?\n",
      "Interviewee: If it happens again let’s try another connection.\n",
      "Okay?\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, that’s fine.\n",
      "That’s good.\n",
      "Interviewee: So why don’t we stay [cuts out 13:31-13:45] difficult connection...\n",
      "Interviewer: Yep, there it goes.\n",
      "Interviewee: There he is, do you want to try hanging up and calling me back.\n",
      "Interviewer; Yeah, I will try calling you back from another number, if that’s okay?\n",
      "That way if it’s my end we will solve the problem.\n",
      "Sounds good?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s fine.\n",
      "Alright, I will hang up now.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Thanks bye.\n",
      "End Part 1 [14:14]\n",
      "Start Part 2[00:00]\n",
      "Interviewee: I’m good.\n",
      "Okay, I can hear you just fine.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, it must have been from my end.\n",
      "I am so sorry about that.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, no problem at all.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so, you were telling me that you mostly don’t see patients clinically you mostly oversee the treatment protocol.\n",
      "What is your educational background?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "My vocational background.\n",
      "Well, I am director of the anxiety disorder center at the institute of living.\n",
      "I am an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Yale university school of medicine.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "And how long have you been working with patients with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think I have been dealing with hoarding disorder since probably, maybe 2003/2002, something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "We are going to move into the part of the interview where we talk about the things that set hoarding disorder apart as a disorder from normal kinds of behaviors.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, for you when you think about hoarding disorder what are some of the most important differences between normal saving behavior such as perhaps collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I think that probably the main one that distinguishes any pathology from its normative behavioral cousin is the degree of dysfunction that it entails.\n",
      "So, you know collecting, normative collecting doesn’t hamper a person’s ability to function.\n",
      "Whereas hoarding very clearly does and it hampers a person’s ability to conduct activities of daily living, it hampers their ability to be safe in their homes.\n",
      "That’s the primary one, I think the other one too is that separates hoarding from collecting is the degree of enjoyment and activity that’s involved with collecting.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah yeah and it makes you go back.\n",
      "So I relive these things every time I talk about them unfortunately.\n",
      "So um there was this time in sixth grade where my mom who is schizophrenic and bipolar.\n",
      "My parents got divorced in third grade so my mom... so I was living alone with my mom and my brother and sister lived with my dad.\n",
      "So the situation was my mom wanted to know what I thought about moving to Canada.\n",
      "We were living in Colorado and it scared me enough somehow that I contacted my brother and sister who were living with my dad and within that week custody changed from me being with my mom to me being with my dad.\n",
      "So I felt guilty for so many years for most of my life that I left mom when I promised her that I wouldn’t.\n",
      "So in cognitive behavior therapy the question posed to me was what would have happened if you had stayed with your mom?\n",
      "So I had to think.\n",
      "Well we could have ended up homeless.\n",
      "We could have… oh and so a result of me leaving also was that she got hospitalized.\n",
      "So in the scheme of things it had a good outcome, although for the longest time I felt bad.\n",
      "It made me reconsider so that I didn’t need to feel the guilt and the shame um that I had and that it was ok the way it turned out and um…\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so would you say maybe a picture that could be associated with the reframing would be someone sitting with a therapist or someone [16:10] ___ showing support or\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, showing support um helping them to realize that there is more than one choice.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah ok awesome.\n",
      "So the goal of CBT many times is to reduce anxiety, so if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in one’s life what would you say it looks like?\n",
      "Speaker: Um having lived with it all of my life it is a little hard to say but anxiety would be someone talking to fast or doing too many things and not necessarily doing them well or not finishing them.\n",
      "Anxiety is that knot in your stomach or in your chest that makes you feel like your heart is going to explode.\n",
      "It’s your mind racing with thoughts so fast that you can’t calm down.\n",
      "I had that just this morning so.\n",
      "Um and you just have to stop what you’re doing, realize that you are out of control.\n",
      "Sort of somehow get yourself distracted or change what you are doing to something that is healthier and get out of that mind frame.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah and um what’s important for other patients to know?\n",
      "Speaker: About\n",
      "Interviewer: About\n",
      "Speaker: anxiety\n",
      "Interviewer: how anxiety can become a problem in someone’s life or um what’s important to know just for someone who is experiencing those things?\n",
      "Speaker: Its ok for you to get help.\n",
      "You don’t have to live with the fear.\n",
      "That fear that’s stalking or inside of you that feels so strong that’s going to overwhelm you every single day, you don’t have to live like that.\n",
      "You don’t have to feel that and it’s not bad and it’s not wrong to ask for help to to find that help or ask a trusted adult to help you find that adult that assistance.\n",
      "Interviewer: Awesome and so could you tell me any skills or specific areas that CBT targets.\n",
      "I know we talked about anxiety, but is there anything else that comes to mind.\n",
      "Speaker: Depression.\n",
      "I know um post-traumatic stress disorder is also kind of part of the anxiety but that helps as well.\n",
      "I don’t know the answer whether or not CBT can solve problems in people who are genetically predisposed which my kids are and I am due to my mom’s history.\n",
      "So there’s probably a psychiatric medicine type component that may need to be included and again there is no shame in that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah definitely and so would you say that it targets thoughts feelings and actions.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "That's a tricky thing, because I think that consciously there's like a lot of activity in this regard, I believe, between my conscious mind and my unconscious mind.\n",
      "Because right now, I'm comfortable.\n",
      "I have, my bed is clear.\n",
      "I have lots of clothes out.\n",
      "I have lots of things right around me, piles of things, that engage my interest, that entertain me, are high stimulation.\n",
      "At the same time, there's too much stuff.\n",
      "And I feel comfortable like subconsciously obviously, because I live here, and this is the way I do all the time.\n",
      "But when I step away from that, when I make the cognitive awareness of it, that's when I'm embarrassed.\n",
      "That's when it causes anxiety.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So would you say that the objects that entertain you are the most important things to you?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "It might be the sentimental things are most important.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Sentimental things.\n",
      "Totally get that.\n",
      "And-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I've sentiments on all kinds of stuff, you know?\n",
      "I overdo what's collectible or what I should keep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "So thinking about-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:39:00].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your possessions.\n",
      "What makes them valuable, and how do you determine how valuable an object is or not?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "The books are obviously, at least have been objectively valued.\n",
      "I have an old first edition Tom Robbins' Jitterbug Perfume that, it's in fine condition, and it sells for about 500 bucks.\n",
      "I don't know where exactly it is, but I know that I have it.\n",
      "I have a number of valuable first editions that I recognize as assets.\n",
      "But at the same time, I would be uncomfortable selling them, because the 500 bucks would disappear in a few weeks.\n",
      "Whereas, having the book, I'd keep the valuable asset.\n",
      "I have a lot of clothes.\n",
      "I end up wearing five percent of my wardrobe.\n",
      "And more than half is inaccessible.\n",
      "Or just in areas that I don't, under piles or in piles or in a box or other.\n",
      "And I have a lot of suits that are worthless.\n",
      "Clothes you wear that, I don't want to give them away, and I have almost no occasion to ever wear them, but I used to wear suits all the time, five days a week.\n",
      "And partly the suits remind me of when I would get up every morning, put on a white shirt, grab a tie, put my suit on, and go out in the world.\n",
      "That kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you would determine how valuable an object is based on it's monetary value or your emotional connection to it.\n",
      "Like your books, they both have monetary and emotional value for sure.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Absolutely, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And I know you mentioned that you feel like you have too much stuff.\n",
      "So if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I've been to a shrink since I was ... since '90.\n",
      "Since I was 40.\n",
      "Continually, since I was 40, for depression help.\n",
      "And we've talked about the house.\n",
      "She sent me to a cognitive person that tried to help me with the house.\n",
      "Didn't get very far.\n",
      "And I'm still going to the shrink, or another person that I've seen in conjunction with her for the last 30 years.\n",
      "And we're still working on that.\n",
      "So yes, I have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you found your shrink through ... when you were seeking treatment for depression?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how do your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Do you get in conflicts with them, or do they not know?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "My friends will know that nobody can come in.\n",
      "My friends are very supportive, and have often offered to help, and they're good enough friends that they accept me for what I am.\n",
      "My family, it's funny.\n",
      "When I was 20 and had my apartment and it was messy, my dad come to visit once and he said, \"You're going to have to do something about this,\" which is the first time he'd ever said anything about my room or where I lived or anything.\n",
      "And that's all he said, since he knew how much stuff I had in there.\n",
      "But he's been gone since like a year after that.\n",
      "And I don't have conflicts with people because they don't come here, so it's not like ...\n",
      "You read about hoarders whose children come home and have trouble coming home.\n",
      "Well, I don't have any children, so nobody needs to live here.\n",
      "Nobody has to be here but me.\n",
      "So there's nobody to have conflicts with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Okay, so for this next section, we're going to talk about space and living area, which you covered a little bit already.\n",
      "And so, you live alone, and so you already described that you've cleaned up the kitchen a little bit.\n",
      "What do your other spaces look like?\n",
      "Are they mostly boxes, or is it piles of paper?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Well, before I started working on the house like six weeks ago, it was just stacks and piles of ... not always necessarily neat stacks, of boxes, or some kind of storage organizational thing, a bin or something full of stuff.\n",
      "So right now, the kitchen is a lot cleaned up, with plenty of floor space on it.\n",
      "You can actually walk around the kitchen.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Thus far, the 125 inspections that I've had in the 22 years that I've lived here, probably closer to 200.\n",
      "But every time they've come in, it's never been actionable.\n",
      "It's been embarrassing, but whatever.\n",
      "But I've got sheets over the piles and clear walkways.\n",
      "And I keep the walkways clear, for the most part.\n",
      "Better than goat trails.\n",
      "I mean, walkways that are [inaudible 00:28:01] or whatever.\n",
      "And the kitchen and the bathroom are always spotless.\n",
      "And like I say, there was nothing unsanitary, it's just that I have too much stuff.\n",
      "It's clutter.\n",
      "So my landlords, I mean, so far, if I saw the notice today, I would go into this hyper focus, hyper drama, high blood pressure, and I would scoop it up and form it and make it look passable, doing this nonstop overnight and then through the morning until 11:00 when they knocked on the door, walked in, looked around, and then, you know, they left.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So there really hasn't been any conflicts with your landlord-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "It would be clean.\n",
      "It would just be, yeah.\n",
      "There hasn't been any conflicts.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But what about-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Any real conflicts [inaudible 00:28:52].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about family?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "My family's scattered.\n",
      "My daughter, 15 years ago was going to school here, and initially I let her into my world.\n",
      "And initially she was anxious and kind of afraid of it.\n",
      "But after a while, she accepted it well enough and interacted with us socially.\n",
      "But other than my daughter, when my parents came to visit, I didn't let them into the apartment.\n",
      "When friends come over, I have them in the lounge downstairs or at the terrace.\n",
      "I don't let anyone in the apartment.\n",
      "And that can be socially awkward at the very least.\n",
      "And offensive sometimes to people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "So do they know-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "My life is at times, but that's nonsense.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do they know about this behavior?\n",
      "Or because they've never seen it, they're not really aware?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I think mostly they're not really aware.\n",
      "Or I'll just say, the way I explain is, I have a roommate and there's not a lot of space, so we don't entertain company.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I live in a apartment complex that has a lounge, has a terrace, has a courtyard, has other places that I can engage or entertain guests.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you mentioned that you live with your roommate in an apartment complex, and you've also mentioned you have three rooms, and your walkways are clear, but there are some areas of clutter.\n",
      "So can you describe a little more what this space is like?\n",
      "Speaker: I guess if I’m giving feedback on um, as far as whatever the end product is to make sure that it is something that all kids would feel comfortable with and not just males or females.\n",
      "Interviewer: And that lends well in to what I am; this next question is what do you think the take home message from the video should be?\n",
      "Speaker: I would say that the take home message would be like in a way they always go like “ask your doctor about so and so” but it would be like a way they show CBT can be to help and that it’s a tool.\n",
      "You want the child to be able to go like “man I could use that, I could really; that would help me a lot.”\n",
      "You see, if it gives them an answer as far as something that connects to them and an option I think that that’s kind of what the CBT, for me, needs to be.\n",
      "It needs to be like “I want to try that; that looks good; it might work”\n",
      "Speaker: That they’re not alone, um, with working through this.\n",
      "That there’s a team.\n",
      "I know my daughter the feedback she gave me early on was um she didn’t realize how nice everyone would be and helpful everyone would be.\n",
      "When somebody’s coming into this there’s a lot of anxiety because I think that um, well I don’t know so I’ll just talk about my daughter’s experience but she thought she was in trouble, she’s here because she’s in trouble.\n",
      "And so I think letting a person know that there’s a process, this is normal, you’re not doing this alone, um there’s a team of us together, the holding the hand type of approach.\n",
      "Speaker: And the kids themselves, it think because they feel different, they feel strange, or weird, or they have all these emotions and why is it that Billy who’s next to me doesn’t do that.\n",
      "So it’s like they need to be able to have something to discern to pull them going like “Hey Billy may not be like that, but Bobby is” Kids are out there like you, you’re not alone.\n",
      "Speaker: Right and like she just didn’t realize and then um when, um I don’t know what they said to her in the first couple sessions but she came away saying “Well I thought it was just me”\n",
      "Speaker: You do because I am a person who has that so I can go like you just feel like wow you’re just so off and everybody else is so right and you feel so different.\n",
      "If you can make that kid go like “wow I’m not that different and there people like me and they can help me” Get that message to them.\n",
      "Speaker: Right and like you know a sense of hope that there is a process and if you are willing to work through the process you can feel more comfortable and not feel as much anxiety about it.\n",
      "Not alone\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And finally is there anything that I missed or anything important that I didn’t ask about that you think is relevant to making CBT videos?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t have any additional comment.\n",
      "Speaker: I think it’s all basically it’s just the videos that show that there’s help for the kids, you know, it’s an option and let the parents know as well as the kids that just the education of it because some people may not have that out there of “it’s an option”.\n",
      "And that’s the big point it’s an option and let the people know “hey I’m going to try it”\n",
      "Speaker: How long were you going to make the video, were you all targeting; have you all thought about how long you’re going to make the video for?\n",
      "The length of it.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Like what to keep?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "If I had to-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I guess just the criteria of how you would choose.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "To get rid of anything, or what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, I guess if you had to choose the criteria of what type of items you would keep if you had to choose between items.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Probably keep the ones that were in good shape or from a family or friend that is gone, that I couldn't recycle or that someone else didn't need.\n",
      "Something that would mean something just to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "That's probably my criteria.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So meaning to more than just yourself.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just that you were saying if it has meaning to not just yourself, but other people as well.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "No, I just mean if it just meant something to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "I misunderstood you.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "It's okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So these questions now are going to be about distinguishing hoarding behavior with just normal behavior.\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I think it's in the way a person can look at an item and decide quickly whether it's really worth saving.\n",
      "My daughter in law, oh it's expired, it's going.\n",
      "It's just like a real non ... it's a very detached analytical way of looking at an item.\n",
      "There's nothing attached to it.\n",
      "It's like, this is an item, simply a cup, and you have 15 cups already.\n",
      "This cup can go.\n",
      "It's just a very detached analytical logical way of dealing with everything really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So they're just taking the emotion out of it is what you're saying.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, take the emotion out of it.\n",
      "Probably, if they went to the store, they would get one of something that maybe I'd get two of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "They would get less of something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like minimalism.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Minimalism, yeah.\n",
      "Minimalism and detachment.\n",
      "There's no attachment to a material or inanimate object.\n",
      "There's nothing attached to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Interviewer: No, should the characters in the videos discuss how exposures work so… basically just how the activities that you’re asking typically engage in CBT… should they ask that?\n",
      "Speaker: I think yes, absolutely.\n",
      "Again, I mentioned it earlier that yes, I would kind of want to know, “how does therapy work?\n",
      "What is it you’re going to be doing?\n",
      "Are we just sitting down and talking across the couch like a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Or are we doing interactive type things or active type things with other people as a way to deal with the anxiety?” So yeah, I would definitely try to get as much information out there as possible because you’re going to put people at ease if they know something… hopefully.\n",
      "Interviewer: Alright and should the characters in the video ask about what parents can and can’t do to help?\n",
      "Speaker: I would say yes, but again, this kind of depends on are you just going to make one video that’s going to address, like I was talking about, you can have a video that addresses a kid a parent can obviously watch that, but you could also have a video that maybe is inclusive to the parents prior to them coming here that does tell them what they should be expected, or what they should be expecting to see, and what they should be expecting to do to help their kid.\n",
      "Yeah, I don’t see a problem doing that, but again, that would be having a therapist obviously talking to the parents, “Mom, dad, here’s what to expect.\n",
      "Here’s what’s going to happen.\n",
      "This is what we need you to do to really help this therapy take hold and work.”\n",
      "Interviewer: Sounds good.\n",
      "So now we’ve talked about who will be in the video, where they will talk, what they will talk about.\n",
      "Let’s talk about how the video would look like, and that’s when I bring these into play.\n",
      "But before I do that, let me ask you, are there any cartoons or animated videos or movies that you like, that catches your interest… your favorite ones to watch?\n",
      "Speaker: Animated… you did say animated…\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, cartoons or animated movies.\n",
      "Speaker: I haven’t watched a cartoon in years.\n",
      "Okay, “How to Train My Dragon.”\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, is that a movie?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah there’s 3 or 4 now, and I don’t believe I’ve actually seen them.\n",
      "I haven’t seen the last one.\n",
      "The characters I think appeal to a certain age group… more of a younger set than high school.\n",
      "I don’t think you’re really seeing high school kids into animation.\n",
      "I think they’re more into the Marvel, DC Comics type stuff.\n",
      "But yeah, the reason I bring up that particular movie is because you’ve got a character in there who has, who’s missing a leg who was a kid who… he’s the kid in the village who’s the son of the chief of the village and he’s a total wimp.\n",
      "I mean he looks like the wimpy kid, and this is a Viking village, okay.\n",
      "So the dad is this huge character, and he’s this peg legged little nobody, and he ends up getting to be friends with a dragon, learns how to fly the dragon, and so on.\n",
      "So in a way, there’s some issues in this movie that can be looked at as being like anxiety.\n",
      "So you may be able to have some relations there, but it’s a movie/ series that’s done pretty well, I think.\n",
      "So with a younger set, in terms of kids, yeah they may find having characters like that talking about certain things they would understand.\n",
      "But again, with high school kids?\n",
      "If you talk to high school kids… I’ll tell you right now, my kids spend more time looking on YouTube looking at stuff and half the time I’m like, “What are you guys looking at?” It’s the weirdest crap… I mean you’re listening to a guy talk about some game and you’re just sitting there listening to him talk about a game.\n",
      "How to do this, how to do that.\n",
      "I don’t know if you know.\n",
      "I don’t get it at all.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "It feels so good to have more open space, that clutter gone.\n",
      "I sometimes worry though that I might have thrown out something I needed.\n",
      "But when I think about my son having to go through my old school papers, I think this is one less job he's going to have to do.\n",
      "So I'm kind of motivated by knowing that someone else isn't going to have to clean the stuff up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you would say that not wanting your son to have to deal with your collections is something that makes you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "No. Well, now with the COVID-19, I feel like I think people are thinking about mortality more.\n",
      "We're all going to die, and after dealing with my mom and my dad's death, there's just so much of it, you realize you don't want to put that burden on someone else.\n",
      "So it doesn't give me the motivation, but that's one of my motivators is thinking that he does not have to ...\n",
      "It's just day to day, whether I can do it.\n",
      "Right now, my grandson isn't around because we're sheltering in place.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "So I only have him online.\n",
      "When he was born, he's autistic.\n",
      "I've been doing a lot of his care.\n",
      "So I went from full-time nursing to pretty much a respite care worker for him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "So I didn't really have the time, even though I know people, if they have an hour or two, they can get stuff done.\n",
      "I need the time and this really good energy to start it.\n",
      "It's hard for me to start it, initiate it, but once I do, I can get it going.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So just switching gears just a little bit, have you ever sought to change this behavior, like going to a professional or a counselor?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I have been to counselors, but I had other problems I was dealing with, like anxiety and depression.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I actually did hire a professional organizer that was just for people who have clutter problems.\n",
      "She was really expensive.\n",
      "It was like $100 for an hour and she came into my kitchen.\n",
      "I still have the cabinets the way she left them.\n",
      "She kind of explained, \"You don't need 50 of those.\n",
      "You live by yourself.\n",
      "You only need maybe five.\n",
      "Pick your five favorite.\"\n",
      "That was hard because of my cups.\n",
      "Again, each of them have special-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Special memories, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I was going to say, and for her, neatly organized wasn't hoarding.\n",
      "Disarray was.\n",
      "So go ahead.\n",
      "Have you what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You mentioned that your co-worker has some issues with hoarding and you helped her.\n",
      "Have you sought any advice or assistance from her to help you de-clutter as well?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "No, because I have to tell you, she is in worse condition than I am, because she is paying $250 a month for storage units housing trash.\n",
      "I tried to convince her, I said, I told her, \"You have spent close to $18,000 almost 10 years hoarding trash.\"\n",
      "There's only trash in those storage lockers, and I mean literally trash.\n",
      "She just can't let it go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever bought storage lockers?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Have I ever what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you have or have you ever purchased storage lockers outside of your home?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "No, no. I just purchased a bigger house.\n",
      "See I knew I could own it, so.\n",
      "But she can't afford a house, so she probably get storage lockers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So I know that you mentioned learning a lot about hoarding disorder from the TV shows, and you enjoy those.\n",
      "Are there other sources that you get information about?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, the famous lady Maria Condo, the one who's in...\n",
      "Or organized.\n",
      "And then there's the Swedish Desks book.\n",
      "It's actually, I read a lot of books, magazines, non-fiction.\n",
      "They tend to have a lot of how to approach things without the full-blown Monty, someone coming in and dumping on me.\n",
      "So the Swedish desk cleaning was very good.\n",
      "The Maria Condo gave me some ideas.\n",
      "Of course, not 100% on either one of those.\n",
      "And just small little things, and you do them for weeks at a time.\n",
      "They become ingrained then.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you, when you hear the words hoarding disorder, how does that make you feel?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Well I don't feel badly, because I know I have it.\n",
      "I just don't admit it to people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay.\n",
      "I'm just looking over the questions.\n",
      "I think we have covered a lot of it.\n",
      "Thank you so much for agreeing to do this.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Oh yeah, thank you.\n",
      "It was like a therapy session, I'm telling you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "It makes me re-think of this.\n",
      "I don't know that I can go home and throw that spice jar away, but I'll have to think about the common sense of this.\n",
      "I can always get another one, but who knows.\n",
      "I'll have to think about this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And talking about-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah, I appreciate you-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... this is helpful.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, I appreciate you calling.\n",
      "That's how I'm doing it for.\n",
      "If it's a chemical imbalance, if it's a mental imbalance, I think it's a combo of everything.\n",
      "That's why I said, no-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Before you go, is it okay, may I ask you your demographics?\n",
      "Interviewer: I’ve heard of those…So here’s some examples.\n",
      "I’ll show you some styles that we want to get your feedback from.\n",
      "You can look through these, and basically there’s a line art style for videos, a [36:55] ___ art style, there’s a comic book blended with live- action type style.\n",
      "So take a look at them really quick, and when you’re done let me know which styles are most appealing to you, which ones you like the most and why.\n",
      "Speaker: Ohhh… so much of this is age dependent.\n",
      "I mean option 2- definitely the younger kids.\n",
      "Option 3 may appeal more to the younger high school set, probably some late term middle schoolers.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you said option 2 for younger kids?\n",
      "Speaker:\n",
      "….yeah.\n",
      "The images… at least the images based here, cartoon characters, I would say yeah you’re appealing to elementary school.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what did you say about option 3?\n",
      "Speaker: I can see definitely more high school and maybe like eighth grade.\n",
      "The maturity level of kids nowadays is, it’s all over the place.\n",
      "It’s amazing how mature they are for their age.\n",
      "I mean option 1 I think would appeal more to the adult.\n",
      "[39:02-39:08]\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Actually, I think option 1 has been used quite a lot in doing like online fat- burner stuff and things like that.\n",
      "Herbal medicine type things, you see it.\n",
      "Interviewer: If you had to choose one for your specific situation, with your daughter and your experiences that you would want to see, which one, if you only had to choose one, would it have to be?\n",
      "Speaker: In my daughter’s case, 14 years old... I actually think she’d go a lot with line art, option 1.\n",
      "Because she’s going into 9th grade I just, in her particular situation, I think, just based on what I’ve seen her working at, she would probably… she’s intelligent enough, mature enough, to derive information from a video like that, as opposed to going to a comic book type route/ cartoon situation.\n",
      "So actually, in a lot of high schools, you probably would get, thinking about it a little more, option 1- adults and young adults.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Sounds good.\n",
      "What do you think the take home message for the videos should be?\n",
      "Speaker: There’s 3 things I gave you before.\n",
      "What did I say?\n",
      "I forgot.\n",
      "Interviewer: Non- threatening.\n",
      "Common.\n",
      "And there was another one.\n",
      "Helpful.\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Helpful.\n",
      "Non- threatening.\n",
      "Common.\n",
      "In essence, everyone has anxiety.\n",
      "Therapy is not threatening.\n",
      "It’s helpful.\n",
      "That’s not too bad.\n",
      "I like all three of those.\n",
      "Interviewer: So going back to that same question you think that same answer applies?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah!\n",
      "In fact, you can say I said that.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Kind of like what people are not getting a handle on with this coronavirus.\n",
      "They don't understand.\n",
      "People don't understand exponential growth, so they're like, \"My God, there's triple the cases there were yesterday and there's triple again tomorrow.\"\n",
      "Well, hoarding is like exponential growth, not linear.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, how would you be able to tell if someone had hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I don't know if you would, unless except for ... I was the head of a math department, and my desk would be full of stacks of books and papers.\n",
      "So, one might think I was just an organizational mess, and one might look at it and go, \"Hm.\n",
      "She hoards books and papers.\"\n",
      "I don't know how you would ...\n",
      "Yeah, not like you can look at somebody and say, \"Oh, yeah.\n",
      "That's a hoarder.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So maybe like an office space would be a way to tell, but not necessarily.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "It might be, and it might be well-hidden if you can keep your office space neat.\n",
      "Or it might be that somebody has no idea what they're looking at.\n",
      "They may just think you're a mess.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Which I am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, where do you get most of your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I've talked to the therapist and shrink I see.\n",
      "I've read some articles on the internet, and the therapist gave me an article that was really interesting.\n",
      "I wish I had it or I could tell you what it was.\n",
      "But she had ...\n",
      "You know how they have to take all these little credit things or whatever, to keep up their licenses?\n",
      "She had taken something about hoarding, and she gave me a copy of the article that she had to read.\n",
      "It was like reading a story about me.\n",
      "It was just on the mark, and she said, \"Well, that's why I gave it to you.\"\n",
      "That's when I realized I'm not the only hoarder in the world, because there must be enough people to have written an article about.\n",
      "Because you feel like you're the only mess, because you don't go into houses of hoarders very often.\n",
      "They don't let you in.\n",
      "So you go into houses of non-hoarders, and you don't know why the houses you don't go in, you're not allowed in or not invited in or something.\n",
      "You just don't go in them, so you don't see other people's hoarding may be as ... like I have no idea on statistics.\n",
      "As much as I read number stuff all the time, I have no idea how many people we think are hoarders in the population or anything like that.\n",
      "I think there are more as they get older, but I don't know.\n",
      "So, the first question is if we were to ask one of your patients “what do you think has caused you to have these behaviors and do they have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause, what is your sense that your patients believe is causing their hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that my patients would believe there is a psychiatric cause.\n",
      "I think most of the people now it’s because I’m seeing people that already know that they are hoarders and have agreed to seek treatment.\n",
      "But I think that some group of hoarders understand that they have a psychiatric illness and that’s the reason they are saving things.\n",
      "Interviewer: And is your sense that they believe that it’s a biological illness, that there is a biological cause for their hoarding disorder or do they have psychological explanations for it?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think most would have more psychological than biological explanations.\n",
      "Interviewer: So they would say “I have this disorder because I had an experience or because I”…\n",
      "Interviewee: Because I experienced trauma in my life or something like that.\n",
      "Yeah, I think a lot of them would say that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "The next one is: how convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding?\n",
      "So, do you think that the patients you tend to see are fairly convinced that they need to keep their items or that some bad will come of discarding?\n",
      "That’s kind of adapted from OCD.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "I think that most of them are fairly convinced that they need to save at least some of these items and/or that something bad will happen if they discard the items.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "So again, this is kind of a broad question but, when you think about your patients with hoarding disorder do you see any kind of potential impact of maybe cultural forces that associate value and self-worth with consumption, material possession, ownership of items?\n",
      "Do you think that that influences hoarding disorder at all or do you think that’s just kind of a side product or not related?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that cultural factors may shape the way that behavior of hoarding disorder manifests.\n",
      "I don’t think that they are the cause of the hoarding disorder and that’s because I think you see that the prevalence of hoarding looks pretty similar across different cultures.\n",
      "But I think that cultural factors may influence how those behaviors are expressed.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what about, again this is kind of perhaps an abstract thing to think about.\n",
      "Ideas that associate saving behaviors with memory, so needing items as souvenirs or jogs for memory.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: What do you think is the connection between memory and saving behavior in hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well its funny because you know most people with hoarding disorder have intact memory.\n",
      "So, what I think they have is very low memory confidence, but they tend not to trust their memory.\n",
      "They tend to worry that they are not going forget things even though, as far as we can tell, their memory is intact.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, they have anxiety about forgetting?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think they have anxiety about forgetting and I think, again it depends on whether you believe that those reasons are really the causes of the behavior or they are justification.\n",
      "I do think people hang on to things because they have sort of warm fuzzy sentimental feel about them when they touch them.\n",
      "But I’m getting off course.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And can you describe a time when you're high stimulation environment got in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Well, I live in San Francisco, which is a high stimulus environment all by itself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "There's so many different social activities that I would like to engage in.\n",
      "So many different causes and [inaudible 00:56:31], great interesting things to be, do, outside your apartment.\n",
      "So many different social groups with which to engage, that I don't engage with, or I engage with a lot less, especially less, because I always have to clean my room.\n",
      "I always have things to do.\n",
      "And I always think in two weeks I'm going to get it done.\n",
      "There have been fissures with friendships because they'll invite me to their house, but then I'll never invite them.\n",
      "They take offense at not ever being allowed, invited into mine.\n",
      "It causes stress to my roommate, which means stress to me.\n",
      "And the inspections are always literally the same thing.\n",
      "We'll get the notice, I'll go into hyper mode, I'll make it and somehow magically make it passible by the next day, even though every single time, she looks at it and says, \"There's no way you're going to do this.\n",
      "No way.\"\n",
      "And so far, every time I have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So your behavior's gotten in the way of you-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Stress and anxiety.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, your behavior's gotten in the way of you socially engaging the way you want to with others outside of your home and with your roommate, and it's upsetting.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "And it affects me emotionally I'm sure.\n",
      "When I look at it, it causes some stress and anxiety, because I recognize it as aberrance.\n",
      "I recognize it as problematic.\n",
      "And I'm embarrassed by it.\n",
      "But it's like always here.\n",
      "And I'll spend, I'll do literally physical labor, in spite of how sore and how much it affects your muscles when you spend a day, eight to ten hours, moving stuff and clearing out an area, mostly to no ultimate, no avail.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah, that's difficult.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "It's frustrating.\n",
      "Very frustrating.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so I know that you recognize that it's problematic and it is frustrating.\n",
      "So would you like to change your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yes, very much.\n",
      "I could do.\n",
      "Tonight I will.\n",
      "As soon as this phone call's over, I'm taking my behavior, I'm going to become a minimalist.\n",
      "I'm going to get rid of all kinds of stuff.\n",
      "And I'm going to live happily ever after.\n",
      "Two weeks.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That sounds amazing.\n",
      "So I know you mentioned that, when you kind of welcomed your daughter into your world, as you said, that she was kind of anxious-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "There was a lot of apprehension there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, she was anxious.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "A lot of apprehension.\n",
      "Interviewer: Likewise, I kind of wonder how you judge the intended use of space, for instance if you have a guest room that you prefer to use for storage is that compromising intended use, or if you have a desk and the surface of your desk is covered with stuff as opposed to being open for space, you know some people prefer to use their tables to store things, and so I wonder how you judge the kind of intended use part of that criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, the way that I do it this is just flying by the seed of my pants is just that it’s probably pretty normal to have a space or two that you dedicate to storage.\n",
      "But there are certain distinctions that one would expect, like that one would be able to cook in a kitchen, or that you would be able to sleep in a bedroom, or that you would be able to walk through just about any room that you have, or that you would be able to sit on living room furniture.\n",
      "And so, when you see those functions being compromised that’s when it becomes a little clear to me that we are talking about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Yeah if somebody just, if somebody’s house was just fine and they just said you know I just have this guest room that I use for storage, I probably wouldn’t call that hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And similarly, if their house was fine but they said I use my dining room table to store a lot of stuff, that too I might call sloppy but I don’t think its hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: Another thing to kind of think through on these criteria is kind of related to what is actually going on with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So sometimes people prefer their spaces to be more cluttered, they prefer to have more items around them and sometimes hoarders…\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Clinicians have reported to us that hoarders say they like a space that is kind of more enclosed, that has more, that makes them feel safe because it has more items and is hoarding disorder about saving the space itself?\n",
      "About creating the space that they want to inhabit or is the space just kind of a byproduct of their need to save?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s a byproduct, you know again I think that an awful lot of post talk rationalization that occurs.\n",
      "I mean I don’t doubt that there are some people that prefer more cluttered space but I don’t think that hoarders engage in behaviors because they set out to do that to their homes.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "The final DSM5 criteria I just want to think about reads: This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them, and so the question we had about this one is how do you determine distress and particularly how to determine distress in cases where people have low levels of insight about their own behaviors and their own kind of ability to throw things away.\n",
      "How is this distress kind of assessed by a clinician?\n",
      "Interviewee: Its primarily based on the persons self-report, and we might ask if I challenged you to throw away a magazine, how would you feel about that and your trying to get a sense of the whether the person would say that would be awful, I would feel like my arms are being ripped off or something like that.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Every surface pretty much is stacked with things.\n",
      "Not necessarily, almost none of the same things, just different things.\n",
      "For the longest time, and I got so close once, I wanted to have the kitchen counter cleared, right?\n",
      "And I'll get close to that, and then two days later, I'll weigh in, and there'll be stuff all over the counter again.\n",
      "When I go to clean one area, invariably I move stuff around and put it in other areas.\n",
      "The easy chair, the lounge chair in my room, is covered almost to the ceiling with stuff.\n",
      "You know, boxes of stuff, suitcases, a bag of things I intend to sell sometimes.\n",
      "Paperwork.\n",
      "And a lot of the room is that way.\n",
      "One corner I have things stacked up literally to the ceiling in plastic bins and stuff.\n",
      "And I haven't had access to that, or haven't made access to that in more than a year.\n",
      "So clearly this is not stuff that is necessary in my life.\n",
      "I haven't used that whole pile in more than a year.\n",
      "I could just take all that away and have that space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So do you think that, as you mentioned, the counter tops are covered with things and such, do you think there are parts of your home that aren't being used in the way that they're intended to be used?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Well, I mean, my living room is a open social space for everyone that lives here.\n",
      "I mean, I use a lot of it, too.\n",
      "I use a lot of my space as storage.\n",
      "And San Francisco apartments aren't known for ample storage at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Understood.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Other than that, you know, it's not like I have books in the bathtub or anything.\n",
      "The kitchen is clear, except for things on the counter.\n",
      "And there are times when I'll make a conscious effort, put five hours into it.\n",
      "I don't think I could do it in half an hour.\n",
      "It'll take me six and a half hours, but I'll get the counter almost cleaned off.\n",
      "But the kitchen sink and all the dishes and everything are always clean.\n",
      "The bathroom's always clean, cleaned several times a week.\n",
      "Those areas are not impacted at all by the hoarding.\n",
      "My shelves are pretty full, though, yeah.\n",
      "My cupboards are pretty full.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So those rooms that you have things stacked up, the countertops, would you consider those areas cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yes, absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about, are there any other areas, and what do you consider to be cluttered?\n",
      "The dining room, a long time ago, I gave away my dining room table and chairs, so the dining room is like a staging area, and it is stacks of boxes and containers, that was put in there since we started working.\n",
      "The living room is still piles, because we haven't reached it yet.\n",
      "And essentially, the bedrooms, one of them, you can't really get into right now.\n",
      "The other one, I used to use as a computer office.\n",
      "It has little trails.\n",
      "There's a desk, and the bedroom has a trail to the bathroom, and over to the bed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Well, of course, the ones in the magazines.\n",
      "Well, I would like it to look inviting.\n",
      "I would like it to look like, if somebody came to the door, and I asked them to come in, it would like an interesting, comfortable place to live.\n",
      "I don't mind ... I have so many books.\n",
      "So there's shelves full of books, and ...\n",
      "And by the way, I gave away 1000 books a couple of years ago, but of course, you just get more back.\n",
      "You buy more.\n",
      "So I don't mind them seeing a lot of things, if they're relatively neat, and it looks like they're stored in some sort of neat, organized way.\n",
      "I don't want them to just see a dining room full of boxes.\n",
      "I don't want that, but I don't mind if some knitting projects or needlepoint projects are placed in some kind of containers to organize them in the living room, because that's where I'm doing the work.\n",
      "So I don't feel like I have to hide stuff away like that, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "So, a little bit more comfortable than the magazine rooms.\n",
      "Not quite so empty as they are, but floor space and places to sit without moving things.\n",
      "A nice, neat kitchen, where you think it's safe to eat the food that's produced there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you talked about how you have a lot of books and a lot of needlework and stuff like that.\n",
      "How important are these things to you?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "How important are my things?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I think they're pretty important.\n",
      "Like the jigsaw puzzles, which I have quite a number of, and of course, they're in the boxes.\n",
      "That's the easiest thing to neatly put away.\n",
      "But they're probably ... I haven't let any go, but I could.\n",
      "But I might, maybe having a table to do it on keeps me from letting them go.\n",
      "So they're like, lowest on the totem pole of importance, even though I still have them.\n",
      "Speaker: It was, I mean for me with it just from an academic side of things, it was close enough to the areas I which I have studied in the past that you know I have bits and pieces of it through academic journals or professional papers and things to that nature, um but um, not anything that as far as um popular media is concerned that I would have gotten, or that is sort of out there that I was familiar with from that area.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, anything from like friends or like other sources like people, word of mouth type sources\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t think so as far as for CBT as far as um that as an option.\n",
      "I haven’t really sat down with mothers or parents and gone like “this is what you need to do for your child” um I have another family member who is just starting to possibly go through that process themselves, so I’m kind of in a way educating them.\n",
      "I don’t think it’s always out there where people can go “let’s turn to CBT” and I still don’t think it’s like right of the tongue for people to try.\n",
      "Speaker: My sisters a schoolteacher and so she certainly provided when this became an issue for un provided a lot of information for us and one of my sons has dyslexia and the person who had worked with him in his elementary, early elementary, we had talked to her and she had guided me toward to trying to see through you all CBT and she sort of explained sort of what the process was gonna be.\n",
      "It’s another counselor but it’s not the area that she works.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, makes sense.\n",
      "Um thinking about your experience with CBT, were there any parts of therapy that were confusing to you guys?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, I don’t think anything is confusing for CBT, other than it may not always be a clear picture of like how long you may have to go through a certain element of it because you really unless you start that particular thing with the child you don’t know if this will take a day or two weeks, or so that part will always be kind of cloudy because there is no black and white, everybody is different, everybody’s brain works differently, everybody has more challenges in some ways or others, so I think the time frame is really something that can’t really be nailed down.\n",
      "Interviewer: yeah\n",
      "Speaker: With the exception of the time issue, I thought that both the, uh, psychiatrists that we initially saw and then the counselor on the first visit I thought explained quite well what the process is gonna be.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s good\n",
      "Speaker: As far as my stand point, and I’m not sure for my daughters but\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, ok.\n",
      "What do you think you guys would tell someone who is just about to start CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: I think I would tell them that a good worthwhile tool that will really aide them in getting a faster result than normal, our children both have CBT and they both have medication, so um I’ve seen medication and the CBT work together work the best, but if I had to choose one or the other I think the CBT by itself alone will get you results because you’re pushing the brain to challenge and overcome that obstacle and make it be okay and then you picture the next one and make it be okay so you’re kind of in a way, in my head, reprogramming your main brain for the rest of your life.\n",
      "And so you have ups and downs, you’re always gonna have ups and downs but the CBT gives you the skills to know “ok now this is just a different challenge of my obstacle” CBT shows that “I’m gonna do it this way” and get through that.\n",
      "It gives you, I think, hope to like “ok I can live my life and be normal” so to speak, again, because you have CBT as your backup.\n",
      "If I need it it’s there and you have the tools for it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yeah. Well, I never was able to finish cleaning my room.\n",
      "It was always like a hard thing.\n",
      "I'd be punished and, two or three days into it, before I would get my room passable or clean enough, and this is back when I didn't really keep a lot of stuff.\n",
      "I just start a project and walk away from it, and don't think to put everything away.\n",
      "I expect it to be there when I get back.\n",
      "And so, cleaning my room has always been an issue as long as I can remember.\n",
      "More recently, the books wasn't really hoarding.\n",
      "The books was collecting, and I'll defend that, even though I had, I don't believe I have too many books.\n",
      "But if that were the circumstances, I think mostly my apartment wasn't big enough.\n",
      "But having lost the books, I still have lots and lots and lots of different things.\n",
      "All of which, I think, have value.\n",
      "I think I need.\n",
      "And I just need to being able to put them all together.\n",
      "I have three rugs and carpet.\n",
      "I have lots of clothes, lots of kitchen stuff, lots of, lots and lots of paper and pens.\n",
      "A lot of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "And how-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:22:19].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "So do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "And why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yes, it's a problem for me, because it consumes a lot of my time.\n",
      "It causes a lot of anxiety for me and for my roommate, people around me.\n",
      "It's embarrassing.\n",
      "And I always think that, and my therapist laughed at this, she doesn't want to hear it any more, but I always think that I can get it clean in two weeks.\n",
      "Give me two weeks, and I can make this livable.\n",
      "I can make it orderly.\n",
      "But that two weeks has been going on for 20 years, 40 years.\n",
      "And it doesn't, hasn't been the last two weeks.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "And I'm always cleaning.\n",
      "I'm always trying to organize this.\n",
      "I get caught up in the minutia, and I tend to lose focus quickly.\n",
      "So I'll start cleaning a pile and look at something, and then it'll remind me of something else, and then 10 minutes later I'm 14 steps away from cleaning the pile, and the pile's long forgotten.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So you believe this behavior is a problem for you because it's affecting your mental health negatively.\n",
      "You're having anxiety from this.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Well, socially it's restrictive.\n",
      "It's very restrictive socially.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "What was your question?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, I just asked if you've ever sought to change this behavior, in the sense that, have you gone to a professional or done any self-help, or anything that you think that you have done to change this behavior.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:34:00] beyond clutter when you have a chair that people can't sit in, because there's all kinds of stuff on it, you know?\n",
      "I don't have a lot of wide open space.\n",
      "My carpet, my central area of the room, I have clothes folded and stacked and thrown everywhere.\n",
      "I have a lot of fans.\n",
      "I have, I still have a lot of books.\n",
      "But it's not like, none of them are organized.\n",
      "It is disorder.\n",
      "Chaos.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So anything that's disordered and chaotic, you would consider cluttered.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Well, as long as it's sanitary.\n",
      "Anything unsanitary [inaudible 00:34:54] house, right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "If it grows or organic or mold or anything that is unhealthy, that's not clutter.\n",
      "That's a different issue.\n",
      "And that's not an issue that I have.\n",
      "My clutter is, there's nothing unsanitary about it.\n",
      "It is hygienic.\n",
      "It's just too much stuff for the space that I have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I remember you mentioned-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Having this conversation's helpful to me, because it makes me all the more optimistic that having talked this out, the next two weeks I'll get this done.\n",
      "I'll get it done in a week.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's awesome.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Let's cross our fingers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Love the optimism.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Let's just believe that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "It can happen.\n",
      "I mean, I can do it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So you mentioned before that you desire to live in an open and aesthetic space.\n",
      "I remember those words being said.\n",
      "Is there any other ways you would like your home to look?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I'm aware that having things everywhere makes everything a lot harder than it should be.\n",
      "When I go to, I lose things all the time, and spend sometimes days looking for my keys or looking for my wallet, or whatever.\n",
      "And having things that I don't remember that I have, it's been a long time since I've seen them, and they're not a part of my life.\n",
      "And I would like to not be embarrassed about my living space.\n",
      "I'd like to have, be okay with people coming in and seeing how I live.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So being open and things being organized would make things just whole on living and finding your items so much easier.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "It would make things a lot more easier.\n",
      "Utilitarian is what I would aspire to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Great word.\n",
      "So, how important are your things for you to feel at home, and which of your things do you think are the most important to you?\n",
      "Interviewer: So, you’ve never encountered a case with animal hoarding where you were like not really sure if this really counts as that, there’s a lot of animals…\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I mean again recognize that other than for purposes of conversation there’s no usefulness to the language hoarding.\n",
      "It doesn’t serve anybody other than to be able to talk amongst yourself and say oh yeah we have a hoarding case that we’re dealing with and that’s shorthand jargon to explain what’s going on.\n",
      "There’s no advantage.\n",
      "It’s not listed in a cruelty (INAUDIBLE 15:06) where you have something to gain some brownie points or some utility by the label.\n",
      "If it becomes a cruelty case, you are still going to prosecute it under the cruelty laws which are very specific specifications for failure to comply necessary standards of food, water, shelter, sanitary environment, veterinary care.\n",
      "But when you’re dealing with the case operationally, you’re gonna just say to your friend or coworker, we have a hoarding case and that captures the whole thing in a nutshell.\n",
      "Interviewer: So from a law-enforcement perspective it really doesn’t matter if they’re a hoarder or not as long as it’s neglect and it’s cruelty, it’s cruelty.\n",
      "It doesn’t matter if they’re technically a hoarder or if they’re technically not.\n",
      "Interviewee: There’s no advantage and in fact there’s a lot of disadvantages, sadly.\n",
      "Because of the way the law requires it to (INAUDIBLE 15:56) house, what I’ve got to do to prove cruelty is that the conditions are (INAUDIBLE 16:02-16:05).\n",
      "In order for me to prove the way the case will be charged and the way I would prove it is I would have to take a picture and have an accurate identification of that gray cat, that gray male two-year-old cat at that particular place and time who did not have proper sanitation, shelter, food, water, or veterinary care.\n",
      "See what I mean?\n",
      "So I would have to do that for every single cat.\n",
      "Interviewer: So the fact that there are seventy-two cats doesn’t make it a difference that you have document each separate case.\n",
      "Interviewee: Technically it does not.\n",
      "I wish it did.\n",
      "That would make our lives vastly easier in terms of dealing with the cases, but no. As far as the law goes it is a case-by-case-by-case violation.\n",
      "Interviewer: So this is a little bit of a, maybe you just don’t know the answer to this question, but I suspect you might have some idea.\n",
      "What happens to people who are animal hoarders after their animals are taken away from them?\n",
      "Do they just start accumulating animals again?\n",
      "Interviewee: The truth of (INAUDIBLE 17:11), the old adage you know we always said they would have a cat on the way home from court.\n",
      "Because the compulsion is so strong in most of these cases that unless you incarcerate people, physically prevent them in some way from doing it, this is a deep-seeded addiction type behavior and they’re going to, they need to do it.\n",
      "It is a very deep-seeded thing and so they are going to acquire more animals most of the time.\n",
      "(INAUDIBLE 17:41-17:52) It’s going to be a local case in a local community.\n",
      "They’re going to say you are prohibited from owning any animals or owning more than two animals or whatever it is in this town for say two years or three years or five years or whatever it may be.\n",
      "But that doesn’t stop them from picking up their toys and going to play in another town basically.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah so from personal experience you didn’t really have any questions.\n",
      "You kind of knew what to expect.\n",
      "Speaker: Right.\n",
      "Well for… I didn’t know what to expect for her specifically.\n",
      "So it’s been interesting to watch the changes happen.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, and how much did you know about CBT from movies, the media, TV, other people, and if so did this match yours or your child’s experience?\n",
      "Speaker: So would this involve mindfulness as well or...?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Ok.\n",
      "I mean I can think of a Star Trek movie that indicated being in the moment and how I can relate that to slowing down time and getting things to work differently or better.\n",
      "Say the question one more time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah um so how much did you learn or hear about CBT from movies, TV, internet, media, any of those outside sources?\n",
      "Speaker: Um there… I’m a Interviewer so there are a couple of Interviewer songs that indicate breathing techniques you know slow down, appreciate where you are, and take a breath, or take a deep breath and hold on.\n",
      "So songs definitely, movies a couple of movies specifically that Start Trek one I don’t remember the name of it.\n",
      "It was with Jean Picard.\n",
      "Um TV, I don’t watch TV much so I cants say much to that um and most people do not talk about therapy so I can’t say that it was anything from what someone said.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um so what was described in the Star Trek movie and some of the songs you heard?\n",
      "Do those thing being described match yours and your daughter’s experiences with CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Part of it yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: And thinking about yours and your child’s experience was there anything about CBT that was confusing?\n",
      "Speaker: About the… I didn’t know how… didn’t know the method um and they didn’t tell me.\n",
      "I mean they told me it was a CBT based therapy, but I had go find out what CBT was because they weren’t going to tell me how they were going to work with me or my daughter so.\n",
      "Kind of had to find out along the way.\n",
      "07: 27 Interviewer: mmh yeah so really like the method, the process was what was confusing.\n",
      "Speaker: I do have to say that learning the breathing techniques at first, or actually for a while and for some people, I know it was very strange so I’ve been through DBT as well and um some people I remember just seemed to think that it was just more Buddhist type of an activity and I know I also sort of thought that as well because some of the… if you say the word meditation if you are talking to kids from strong Interviewer background, people who do still go to church although it seems like we are dwindling group um, it’s a little put offish in way.\n",
      "You have to make yourself overcome the way it sounds to accept the way it works.\n",
      "interviewer: Right, ok awesome and what would you want to tell someone who is about start CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Give it time to work.\n",
      "If it feels weird the first time in the first session its ok.\n",
      "It’s not just talk therapy.\n",
      "There is a purpose for it.\n",
      "There is a goal in mind.\n",
      "You are not just going to be stuck in talk therapy forever so give it three to five sessions before you make a strong opinion about what it is and how it is affecting your child’s behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: So being patient and knowing that it truly is a goal-oriented type practice.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok awesome and if you could think of three words to describe CBT when you first learned about it, what would those be?\n",
      "Speaker: I’m thinking.\n",
      "Interviewer: Take your time\n",
      "Speaker: Calmness, reframing… all I can think about are sentences um… I can’t think of another word.\n",
      "I can think of mindfulness… being in the moment.\n",
      "I don’t know how to say that in one word.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, how did you decide when you had too much stuff?\n",
      "How did you know?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "When you can't get into your house, it's pretty clear you have too much.\n",
      "And way before then, I realized I was getting too much.\n",
      "But I fell down the stairs in January, and I didn't have my phone with me.\n",
      "And I thought at first that I couldn't get up, but I could get up.\n",
      "But if I hadn't been able to get up, I would have ... I thought, \"Well, first of all, I don't have my phone, so I can't call for help.\n",
      "Second of all, even if they knock down the door, they can't even get in the house, really.\n",
      "They, whoever might come to help.\"\n",
      "So then you realize, \"This is a little excessive.\"\n",
      "It has become a safety issue.\n",
      "And I think it was a safety issue for a long time before I said, \"Yes, it's a safety issue.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that makes sense.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So I think that covered all of the ideas of value and stuff, and how you value your items.\n",
      "The next section is discussing how you distinguish hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And so like, what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and what is hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I guess hoarding is ... and my collecting comes under obsessive-compulsive.\n",
      "I mean, it's not just saving something.\n",
      "It's a lot.\n",
      "A lot.\n",
      "And the hoarding is ...\n",
      "Maybe it has to do with what I've been describing.\n",
      "There are so many different things that I collect.\n",
      "If I only had books, and I didn't have all the other stuff, the house would maybe be all right.\n",
      "But I have books and needlework, and TV.\n",
      "So, hoarding is like ...\n",
      "It's just excessive.\n",
      "It's a matter of degree.\n",
      "It's not just a collection that you would put out for somebody to see.\n",
      "It's keeping it for me.\n",
      "You can't see it all.\n",
      "There's nowhere to see anything in this house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you think maybe that saving behavior is different from hoarding in the sense that saving is kind of like, people collect things and then they can put it on display, but it's more like hoarding when no one's coming to see it all.\n",
      "It's just for your own personal satisfaction.\n",
      "Am I understanding that?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Well, and the degree of how much of it there is.\n",
      "It's not a sensible amount of something like a little collection of teapots.\n",
      "I know somebody that has a collection of teapots.\n",
      "It's nothing like that.\n",
      "If I was a teapot collector, I'd have teapots from all over the world, and they'd still be in boxes and I'd have them stashed away somewhere, because there would be no place to put them.\n",
      "So it's a degree.\n",
      "It's a degree, there's so much more stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: The uh, yeah I like that idea of like a cartoon person.\n",
      "I mean the only, sometimes, issue you get with, if you have an actual person is that a child might say “that’s not me”.\n",
      "And so if it’s a cartoon character they’re going to listen to what that person they’re not going to immediately not associate with that person.\n",
      "Speaker: You can make that character out to be very versatile as far as ethnicity and character and clothes and hair that you can go with a broad spectrum that a lot of people could identify with that character.\n",
      "Speaker: I think a lot of if you’re trying to do a video is, what is that main age group that you’re trying; that you think is going to be watching that video.\n",
      "But I would encourage you that whatever that age group is that you think is going to be your target audience, I would go just a type younger because people can always see down they can’t always see up.\n",
      "And I think uh, and could just be my slant on this but, you know you don’t want to show them a video that they can’t relate to because that’s only going to make them feel more powerless.\n",
      "I just think that a lot of it is feeling powerless of you know handling your circumstances or situations and stuff, but it needs to be something that they’re going to feel comfortable with.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you think, in general, parents, friends, doctor, do you think those people should be characters in the video other than the main child or animal or the main character?\n",
      "Speaker: I think so, because if you have some authority figures in there as far as a doctor or a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n",
      "Somebody or even a teacher or a counselor at school, if you have a figure like that in there, it also might give them an idea of like where else they can get help or where else people can find the tools to learn about CBT, is the caregivers, the teachers, because that gives them focus instead of just the family or the kids or the peers.\n",
      "You know, you kind of need the more well-rounded picture of what life is anyway.\n",
      "I think that would add to it.\n",
      "Speaker: I feel like, what you had described earlier about the holding hands and being together and stuff.\n",
      "I think that the more of the influencers on the child that’s causing them anxiety which would be self, home, school, friends, doctors, counselors.\n",
      "I would think that you would want to portray within that, you know to help them see that this is the world which you know, I’m seeking this therapy through.\n",
      "Speaker: Because you have to have a whole picture\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, that’s right.\n",
      "Speaker: to kind of see their whole environment that’s it’s going to add, come into and be a part of.\n",
      "It gives them hope that they can use it in all parts of their life\n",
      "Speaker: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: And building off of that, you know, we are trying to decide where they’ll talk, where this video will be set.\n",
      "So you know, home, school, doctor’s office, somewhere outside, like a park.\n",
      "Any ideas or inclinations towards those?\n",
      "Speaker: I kind of see maybe being in an outdoor kind of area, so it seems like it’s a very, um, it’s not a stifling kind of conversation and whoever they’re talking to or talking about, it’s like they’re outdoor or an activity that’s very; they’re on the edge of what’s happening in the real world.\n",
      "A soccer game or some type of thing they’re on an edge talking about this and real life passes you by, it goes on, and continues, but we’re here in this outdoor world and we’re talking about what’s happening to me.\n",
      "Interviewer: What would they say?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well here’s an example in a book that you can get at (INAUDIBLE 19:49) it was written by (NAME 19:52) and (NAME 19:53) she’s a journalist and he’s a sociologist.\n",
      "They looked at the case of (NAME 20:00) dogs and so they ended up spending a lot of time interviewing her and listening to her side of the story so to speak.\n",
      "And she had all kinds of (INAUDIBLE 20:12) things about being in the Navy, studying to be a doctor or a nurse, or a veterinarian, studying law, just a whole series of things that didn’t make a whole lot of sense in her life.\n",
      "She started telling all these tales about trauma, and so there was a trigger warning here.\n",
      "I think the important thing is that she believes it’s true.\n",
      "She claims that when she was young she was serially molested by her grandfather and the dogs were often the only comfort she had afterward, so she would go to her dogs for solace.\n",
      "One time the dog actually, through barking and jumping, interrupted the attack and then the parents got rid of all the dogs.\n",
      "(INAUDIBLE 21:00) And then she recounts a tale of being molested by a farmhand that worked on the farm and he forced her to marry him and then when she was pregnant she, I guess the farmhand left her or something, and then when she was pregnant the mother sent her to the barn to have the baby.\n",
      "After she delivered the baby alone the mother came in and took the baby away and she never saw it again.\n",
      "So, who knows you know?\n",
      "There were lots of stuff in there.\n",
      "But I think what’s relevant is that whether it happened or not she felt the urge to tell that story.\n",
      "Presumably she also believed it because she felt it was important to tell that story.\n",
      "Those kinds of stories are not uncommon, so if you can actually engage people and start talking.\n",
      "I don’t have any frame of knowledge to know how many people of the general population who are now hoarders will also tell the same story.\n",
      "My thought is probably nowhere near as many.\n",
      "I think these stories of terrible trauma are over-represented in animal hoarders, but as they are in many other kinds of (INAUDIBLE 22:15) behavior.\n",
      "It’s just what we don’t know is why do some people if they’re going to accept the premise that trauma is a contributory factor, why do they go in that direction instead of abusing drugs, alcohol, or all the other things people do when they’re trying to cope.\n",
      "Speaker: Because… so my daughter sometimes plays games with my daughter.\n",
      "My daughter is 13, so I know games can sometimes help a therapist reach a child or you now.\n",
      "In terms of who would be in it, I would include kids of different ages, different races, male and female.\n",
      "I know a lot of the psychologists are female, but it would be good to show you know a man working with probably a boy.\n",
      "I know my daughter doesn’t want to see anyone who is not a female.\n",
      "So um you know that’s her thing.\n",
      "Parents could be in a waiting room, but they could also be talking to the therapist.\n",
      "You don’t want to necessarily show the checking-out procedure of you know paying because that’s not CBT.\n",
      "That’s policy.\n",
      "Got to pay for what you are getting.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok great!\n",
      "What about nonhuman characters, animals, superheroes, do you think any of those would be appealing?\n",
      "Speaker: Well there are... ok so your mascot almost, sort of.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well not necessarily.\n",
      "It could just I mean for the superheroes that would just be another way to represent things.\n",
      "36:4o Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: But this based on your perspective.\n",
      "It’s what you think.\n",
      "If you don’t think that superheroes, animals, nonhumans should be involved [36:47] ___.\n",
      "Speaker: I know a lot of times they are effective marketing tools.\n",
      "Would I put them in?\n",
      "Probably not, but I’m also not a marketer.\n",
      "So I know in the real world there are emotional support animals that really could make an appearance.\n",
      "For the younger kids, it would probably be useful to have something cartooning, not anime though.\n",
      "That’s a little to strange.\n",
      "Something that is safe appearing, not something creepy or cringy you know.\n",
      "You want a teddy bear.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so really just the people that are really involved in the process like the kids, the parents, the therapist and stuff like that.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah… I don’t know if you would…teachers don’t usually get involved in?\n",
      "Interviewer: Sometimes, it depends.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know if I would include anything outside of nuclear family or grandparents.\n",
      "It would be the people who would give consent.\n",
      "It would the people who have legal authority over the child.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah great.\n",
      "Um so what about where they would talk… what would be a good setting for the video or multiple settings?\n",
      "Speaker: Um I’m a realist so you know to set the standard.\n",
      "Show them a typical room.\n",
      "Different therapists decorate a little differently.\n",
      "If there’s… if certain colors are meant to elicit certain feelings or um responses do that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: I probably would not do one where there’s a two-way mirror involved because that is that would make anybody feel uncomfortable so.\n",
      "It’s like I’m being watched.\n",
      "Interviewer: So really just like the therapist office would be the best setting.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah because you don’t want to sugarcoat it.\n",
      "I mean you want to be realistic about it and it’s not a miracle cure.\n",
      "A lot of it is the therapist drawing you out or drawing your fears out to touch them without making you feel like you are on the burner.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: So I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Good!\n",
      "And so yeah this is shaping up nicely.\n",
      "What should be talked about in the videos and should there be specific questions asked and addressed in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: I would ask the counselors or the psychologists that one.\n",
      "I don’t… I don’t know.\n",
      "Um… questions again so if it’s a counselor talking with a child, I’m trying to picture it in my head when I close my eyes, so um you know friendly opening questions like “How was your day to day?” you know.\n",
      "Did you have any so for performance anxiety you know, “How did your test go?” Or “How did your presentation go?” You know ask things that um... are relative to what they are going through.\n",
      "If they are going to school ask then ask school related questions to sort of be the icebreakers.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Um if they are working, um…you know if you are talking about the adults being the patients um and not just the parents um… is that part of the scope or is it?\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s more so the perspective of the child as the patient but the parents are still involved.\n",
      "Speaker: Ok… so um you know if they have a lovey animal, you know a little lovey animal or a stuff animal that they bring with them you know, if it’s not too corny you can ask how the lovey is doing or the stuff animal so.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, and should they ask about how it worked for other kids?\n",
      "Speaker: How who should ask?\n",
      "Interviewer: Like should that a be like a question between maybe characters or should it be in the form of kind of a little snippet of an interview of kids explaining how its worked for them.\n",
      "Speaker: I’m not completely sure they know what method is being used on them and I’m not quite sure it’s necessary that they know.\n",
      "They just need something that works and helps them to uh navigate life better.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Do you think that there should be kids saying those things like its helped them, the feel better, and things of that sort?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: What about how exposures work?\n",
      "Speaker: Um I don’t think my daughter has done that.\n",
      "I don’t know… I don’t know how to answer that one.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Speaker: I guess exposure to me in my situation means that uh they… like my counselor is uh just incredibly good.\n",
      "If there is a day like I don’t feel like talking, she draws me out easily and she knows how to get me to talk.\n",
      "So for exposures she has me think of a memory and she has me put my… what’s the word, not my real finger, my um… psychological finger.\n",
      "I don’t know how to say that.\n",
      "So that to me the exposure is bringing old moods out into the open.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah and for some other kids the disorder may be putting them in a situation where they must face their fears or something that’s bothering them so do you think that would be beneficial to show in the video?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, so um again thanks for coming to meet with us today.\n",
      "So basically what we’re doing here is we’re a group of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists that are working on a project about cognitive behavioral therapy.\n",
      "It’s a kind of therapy that, you know, you guys have been doing with your therapist or therapists.\n",
      "But for this project we really want to develop, um, basically a few short educational videos that describe what cognitive behavior therapy is for children and their parents.\n",
      "Saying “cognitive behavior therapy” is kind of a mouthful, so from this point on I’ll just be saying CBT and that’s what I’m referring to.\n",
      "Um, kind of, so the first thing we’re wondering is what comes to mind when you guys think of CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, for me I would say that CBT is kind of a learning process of how to take some kind of behavior that is not quite acceptable or something that you want to work on and baby steps and step it to a place where you rather prefer it to be to get to an end point.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Speaker: I took it as helping you stop a behavior that you have trouble stopping yourself.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, excellent.\n",
      "Could you tell me what you guys know about CBT, so like, in your own words how would you explain it?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, for me CBT is a process of physical and or mental challenges to train yourself brain-wise to get to a place behavioral-wise, so you’re trying in a way to shift your brain to make your brain and your body do correct behavior so that you’re a happier brain person.\n",
      "Interviewer: I will definitely look at that.\n",
      "I would be really interested to see that paper.\n",
      "This is all very fascinating.\n",
      "So, we’ve talked a lot about how you kind of came to work (NAME 26:25) and (NAME 26:25) about the similarities with material object hoarding and I wonder if you could talk me through some of what you perceive are the differences, or the bigger differences, between material object hoarding and animal hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well the biggest, probably the biggest difference, unless proven otherwise, is that animals provide for a two-way relationship.\n",
      "I suppose you could psychologically invent a two-way reciprocal relationship with objects.\n",
      "Maybe your stuff sort of gives you a positive feeling back (INAUDIBLE 27:00) with a living creature that’s going to react to you.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, that’s the biggest thing is the animal’s response.\n",
      "So, the hoarder is looking for a response from the animal?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah and it may well be again that we don’t fully understand the range of etiological of backgrounds.\n",
      "Is it all trauma related?\n",
      "It seems like a lot of it is trauma-related.\n",
      "I don’t know how much of object hoarding is trauma related.\n",
      "Some of it is, but I don’t know that all of it is.\n",
      "So, I think that balance of trauma even with animal hoarding there seems to be a lot of trauma.\n",
      "Again we don’t have formal psychological studies for people we’ve interviewed and would be able to come up with a diagnosis of accurate histories.\n",
      "It’s just this (INAUDIBLE 27:54) from the people who are willing to talk to us when they’re willing to talk to us or what family members tell us.\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess we talked about a little bit that most of the trajectory that you see with people who have this problem is that they get their animals taken away and then they go when they’re able to go and get new animals.\n",
      "Have you had experience with people who have either gained insight into their problem or else been referred to you or sought treatment for this in a way that has worked for them?\n",
      "Interviewee: So, my colleague (NAME 28:25) is probably the person who has done the most with that kind of work.\n",
      "She’s retired now, but she worked with both of the law enforcement agencies in Massachusetts that intervene in these cases.\n",
      "They used to refer her and she got a lot of court order referrals.\n",
      "She did say that there were some people where she felt she made reasonable progress with and did develop insight and were able to change their behavior.\n",
      "But I think overall our sample size is so ad hoc and small that you have to be careful generalizing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Alright.\n",
      "Is there anything I missed?\n",
      "Anything important that I haven’t asked about that you feel I need to know?\n",
      "Speaker: No, but I would say, and I mentioned this to the part there I think one time, that it occurs to me that there are a lot of people out there who have these kind of issues.\n",
      "As I said, most families may not even give it a second thought and just gloss right over it, that’s the way I was, you know.\n",
      "Finding a way to get the word out, to me, would seem to be critical in your guys’ situation, finding a way, in essence, to market it.\n",
      "That probably… I don’t know… my kids go to a private school so I would treat things a little differently.\n",
      "But I would say, you know, it’s a kind of thing at the beginning of school you’d like to have somebody get up who’s a therapist and say, “Look guys, we want you to enjoy school, but if you’re having these kind of things…” find a way to communicate it to people to where they’re not worried about coming to a counselor.\n",
      "And I know all schools now a days have got different guidance counselors and things like that, or are supposed to be perceptive and picking up on all this stuff.\n",
      "The reality is, they’re still going to be relying on ultimately on the kid coming to them when you’ve got hundreds, in some cases, thousands of kids in some of these schools.\n",
      "So I don’t know if there was a way to show a video at the beginning of the year, or finding a way to get people to talk about this kind of stuff.\n",
      "And I know to a certain extent, they do where my kids go to school.\n",
      "They have small group type sessions, and they meet once a week, and they go over, “How’s everyone doing?\n",
      "What are the problems?” But again, there’s still a stigma attached to it.\n",
      "Somehow you’ve got to get over this stigma, which is why it’s finding a way to communicate, “Look, everybody’s got issues.\n",
      "It’s common.”\n",
      "In today’s world… maybe 30, 40, 50 years ago, we just sucked it up and dealt with it.\n",
      "Any many of us may have problems today that we don’t know about, but finding a way to eliminate that kind of thing and that there is help available for something like this.\n",
      "Yeah I think that if you can… again, CBT, I mean that makes it sound like a bad drug or some way of communicating that this isn’t really uh… it’s a big deal, yes, but it’s not a big deal to get help for it.\n",
      "It could be the smallest things, just like I said, you’re afraid to raise your hand in class, that’s a real wimpy one, but you’re worried about what other people think about you.\n",
      "Gosh, look at all the stuff we’ve got with online issues with Facebook and everything else.\n",
      "You can see what people are blurring out.\n",
      "You can tell most people got issues.\n",
      "Sorry if you’re on Facebook.\n",
      "So yeah, to me, when they first approached me about this, even when we were first starting our therapy, the one thing I thought about was, “Geez.\n",
      "There are probably so many people out there, especially younger generations, who need help who don’t really know they need help, or if they did know they need help, their parents would just be like, “What are you talking about?\n",
      "There’s nothing wrong with you.\n",
      "I see you every day.\n",
      "You look fine.\n",
      "It’s the way you’ve always been.”\n",
      "Not knowing that some of their behavior has impacted their ability to do things in school- it’s had an impact on their life.\n",
      "So yeah… finding a way to deal with that stigma… finding a way to rephrase it, repackage it, show people that it’s common, and that there are ways to deal with it, and that they’re available.\n",
      "To me, that’s a big, big deal finding, helping people.\n",
      "The videos are great.\n",
      "You may even have, if you can create a video, maybe it could even be something that you could put into a high school and watch… actually, even younger than that.\n",
      "Middle school I guess… I mean they’re smart kids in middle school now.\n",
      "Boy, I’m telling you, really smart.\n",
      "So yeah, that would be a good idea, to get that information out there.\n",
      "Speaker: I think that unless you’re going to do a montage of home, school, friends, doctors office, I would do a neutral site in essence whether that’s outdoors or something that is not one of them.\n",
      "Again I think the whole process of this is this isn’t just something you do at a doctor’s office, this isn’t just something you do at home, and this isn’t just something you do at school.\n",
      "So if the setting of that is something that recognizes one of those main areas, I think it takes away from the notion that, but if you have a neutral place that’s outside or something that’s not one of those main areas.\n",
      "Unless you want to do any.\n",
      "Speaker: Like if you did do it in that way, I would think that it would help show that it encompasses all areas of your life.\n",
      "It will help you fix all the different areas of your life, if you do choose to do like different scenarios of places.\n",
      "Like it could help you everywhere.\n",
      "Speaker: Right.\n",
      "I mean I would think that you would either want to try to include as many or one that’s not one of them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Speaker: We give you a 50/50 choice.\n",
      "(Laughter)\n",
      "37:09- Um, So the next thing is what um would they talk about?\n",
      "We’ve already talked about this with the first set of questions, so generally what questions about CBT do our characters need to ask and answer?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, I think possible maybe the characters can talk about how they feel, you know what’s making them feel so; looking for answer kind of thing.\n",
      "And the CBT could be like this is something I’ve heard, I’ve read, or I’ve done and it happens like this and how it helps you so that and when there’s a problem scenario of “I’m feeling sad” or “my life is this, this, this” and then you have the other friend, or person, or doctor whoever talked to them and know this is an option to help that.\n",
      "So, for me it’s like feeling-based of your emotions will dictate how your brain is working and how you are living with your anxiety will cause you to have the emotion and so if they talk about the emotions, everybody has those feelings and so the other person the character’s talking to can say “well I feel that, or understand that, and this is what I’ve found, and this is what I do” if it’s like a similar kind of peer like two kids talking about like “oh I do this too.”\n",
      "Two kids who know one already has CBT in them, one doesn’t, “You seem really sad,” you know, “what’s going on with you?” And they talk a little bit and say “Well, I’ve done this” Scenario kind of thing.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I think just going back to the basics of “why am I here?” “What is this?” “How would this help?”\n",
      "Interviewer: ok.\n",
      "Yeah that makes sense.\n",
      "So, um, the next question we have I have some pictures to show you guys.\n",
      "Basically we want to decide how the video is going to look, so I have some examples I can pull up here.\n",
      "I’ll be able to turn it around for you.\n",
      "Yeah, let’s see… So um we’re hoping to do um six videos, fifteen minutes long, um featuring multiple and diverse children, content supplemented by animated elements and motion graphics.\n",
      "So we have three options.\n",
      "I’ll kind of you just you guys look this over, read this over, and I’ll show you the next two as well… So just let me know when you’re done with that one.\n",
      "And just generally thinking like it, if you don’t like it, and then we’ll talk about the three of them at the end.\n",
      "So this is the first one, this is the second one…\n",
      "And so my contractor is probably the only one who's ever seen the fully Monty.\n",
      "He's seen, because he has to get to everything, right?\n",
      "The upstairs and downstairs.\n",
      "And so he's probably the only one in my life.\n",
      "Not even my ex has seen the full Monty now.\n",
      "Now he's seen the full Monty, meaning everything.\n",
      "Upstairs, downstairs, outside, backyard.\n",
      "And he has finally said after, well it's been 20 years working together on my house.\n",
      "He finally just said last year, \"I can't do anything anymore unless you get rid of some stuff.\"\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like all of this was a reaction to moving a lot in your childhood, and not knowing if you would have resources available, like you mentioned, has caused a lot of conflict within your personal relationships.\n",
      "But do you see your behavior as a problem?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I do, because I can't understand.\n",
      "So I tried to narrow it down to just a few things I have to think about.\n",
      "So the other day I finished a spice jar, and I said, \"Oh, that's a cute jar.\"\n",
      "Now it's a standard spice jar and it comes with all spices.\n",
      "I could get a million of them if I wanted to, and it's still sitting on my counter, empty.\n",
      "I'm thinking of a dual use, and I want to throw it in the garbage can.\n",
      "And of course I've seen it on TV, on Hoarders TV where they say, \"Now what would happen in your life if you did throw it away?\" And I use that test and say, \"I still can't throw it away.\"\n",
      "It's still on my counter.\n",
      "There's nothing special about it.\n",
      "I have to emotional attachment to it.\n",
      "I have a, if I don't have it and I need it approach to it.\n",
      "Now here's the change.\n",
      "In the last, since I fell and I needed more space, I've decided to, \"Okay, I'm only going to make it one item, and not think about everything else, and I'm going to throw it into the garbage,\" and it took everything out of me, all this, I drained me, not to get it back out, out of the garbage can, pick it up, and now it's gone from my life and I don't have to worry about it, and I guess-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How did you feel doing that?\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So just to return for a second to the DSM5 criteria..\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah yeah.\n",
      "I’m sorry I am getting way ahead, I apologize.\n",
      "Interviewer: No no, I appreciate it.\n",
      "It’s a very interesting question and its very interesting to see what different clinicians have to say.\n",
      "The next DSM5 criteria I’d like you to think through with me reads quote: “the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congests and clutters active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use” and so the follow up I have on that one is how do you make the determination of how much stuff is too much?\n",
      "And how do things like the size of their home, or the amount of free space they have access to, or whether other people live with the, play into a diagnosis?\n",
      "Interviewee: It’s a really good question because when two people engage in the exact same behavior but one has a big house and one has a small house you end up with different levels of clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Interviewee: And I don’t know if we have a good way around that, I don’t know if we have a good way of resolving that.\n",
      "We know that without significant clutter there it’s probably not hoarding but it’s important to recognize there are an awful lot of other variables also impact the degree of clutter in the home besides hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, and so another example might be if they live with a partner who cleans up after them.\n",
      "Do they then not have hoarding disorder because they don’t have clutter?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Right, well that piece is fortunately… I think that the way the DSM criteria is worded: ‘if clutter is absent only because of the actions of another” so you can get around that one.\n",
      "But you raise an important question that I don’t think we have resolved very well, which is what about what your current living status is and does that affect whether or not we would diagnosis you with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "And so just trying to find stuff that made you feel confident and going into that situation.\n",
      "And then when the things stopped my habit of finding things to be an armor didn't stop.\n",
      "And then I had a hysterectomy and that hit me pretty hard and that's when it really began to peak and become unbelievable to the point where I didn't want people to come in, where I spent a lot of time sleeping and just basically that's all I did at the house.\n",
      "And it's been really tough with the virus because I haven't been able to just get out of the mess.\n",
      "I'm sort of stuck here in it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I totally understand.\n",
      "So it sounds like it started early, but it was kind of controlled when you were living with your mother and you had developed the habit of acquiring things in the context of kind of needing them to feel good about yourself socially and then that stuck around for your whole life.\n",
      "And then as you've gotten kind of, as things have happened which have caused you to be depressed, it has kind of worse and worse and now unfortunately we're all kind of stuck at home.\n",
      "So you're feeling very trapped in your space right now.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How bad is the behavior now?\n",
      "What is your opinion about how severe it is at the moment?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "My opinion of it is at the moment that I live in constant fear of having to open my door and because I last lost my condominium because of the depression.\n",
      "And I would even say a little bit of a hoarder, but I think it was more of the depression.\n",
      "And so now that I live in an apartment, it's that fear of the owners coming in and possibly kicking me out because of these things and stuff.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, that's a big fear.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So you'd say it's pretty severe now relative to how it's been in the past?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes, I think it's severe.\n",
      "It's not like some of the things that I see on TV where there's rotting food or anything, but there's clothes everywhere.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you say you lost your condominium because of your depression, you mean because of financial issues related to the depression?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I think financial issues and then just my ability to get things organized, maybe not realizing, \"Oh yeah, I didn't pay that.\"\n",
      "Or \"Oh yeah, I got to do that.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So just keeping check of it.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah, because it was just basically trying to survive and not do harm to the house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever kind of gone to seek help to change this behavior either from a, like a counselor or a psychologist, psychiatrist or an organizer?\n",
      "Interviewer: So, the anosognosia patients are the ones that are not coming in for treatment, they’re the ones that don’t even know there is something wrong.\n",
      "Whereas people who are defensive…\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "That’s the people who says I am not a hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Whereas people who are defensive or who have overvalued ideation are at some level aware of the fact that they have a problem but either don’t want to deal with the problem or continue to believe unreasonable things despite the fact that they’re…\n",
      "Interviewee: Precisely.\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer: In terms of overvalued ideation, if you were to describe what that’s like in hoarding disorders is that like somebody who really deeply knows that they have too much stuff but who deeply believes that whatever they are saving is still valuable.\n",
      "Is that what you mean by that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Right that’s the person that you would, that at an extreme level you would refer to them as delusional.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Interviewee: So, the person really and truly believes in their heart of hearts that this is a very valuable thing that they’re holding.\n",
      "Interviewer: And does that tend to take the form of “delusion” where they truly believe it has monetary value, or aesthetic value, or it’s has emotional value, like what is that delusion like?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it can vary I think probably the one I hear most often is either it has utility or that it has monetary value like, I’m going to sell it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay and what about indifference?\n",
      "Do you feel like there is a role for indifference in thinking about insight or is that something…\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think of indifference as being sort of on the anosognosia spectrum.\n",
      "So, like in extreme anosognosia the person has no idea that they have a deficit.\n",
      "In lesser forms of anosognosia they’re aware there is a deficit but they are not terribly concerned about it, I think of that as sort of a lesser form of anosognosia.\n",
      "That reflects the persons level of self-awareness.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "So, when you think about the patients you have encountered either at treatment or research, and I guess probably thinking most closely about treatment, and you encounter a patient who has very low insight.\n",
      "What is your process for helping that patient to gain insight or to get closer to gaining insight?\n",
      "How do you help patients do that?\n",
      "Interviewee: It’s different.\n",
      "It’s difficult, I tend to use strategies from motivational interviewing.\n",
      "In which there are a couple things that happen, one is I am often reflecting back what the person is saying so they can hear themselves and sometimes that helps them to hear what they are saying doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.\n",
      "And then I use the strategy of developing discrepancy between the persons goals and desired life and their current behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, that’s just kind of to help them to see, to perceive that they have a problem is really what you are getting at?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I’m not necessarily trying even to treat their hoarding at this point.\n",
      "What I am trying to do is talk to them about a situation and see if I can get them to generate a little bit of understanding that their behavior is not necessarily in line with what they want to get out of life.\n",
      "Interviewer: What’s your sense for how common this is?\n",
      "Or even just, not to ask you to overgeneralize, I recognize that you kind of see this in a particular space, but are there particular kinds of people who end up becoming animal hoarders?\n",
      "Is it a problem of rural or urban or poverty or women or men?\n",
      "Interviewee: Everywhere, it is everywhere.\n",
      "It is more women than men, for sure, and then they relate to the trauma issue so much of it is sexual and most victims of sexual trauma are women, not exclusively, but most.\n",
      "So that could be one explanation for the gender imbalance, but beyond the gender imbalance it just crosses everything, it crosses all demographics and socioeconomic.\n",
      "You have rich people, you have poor people, you have highly educated people, you have relatively uneducated people, you got colored people.\n",
      "It’s a question of manifestation.\n",
      "You know, wealthy people can hide it a little easier.\n",
      "There have been cases where people have filled up one house with cats and when that one filled up they went and bought another house.\n",
      "Your run of the mill hoarder is not going to have the resources to do that.\n",
      "Beyond the gender imbalance, it crosses, I wouldn’t be able to generalize at all.\n",
      "It just could be anyone, anywhere.\n",
      "Interviewer: There definitely isn’t the data to make generalizations at this point, I understand that.\n",
      "Again, just thinking from your experience, do people tend to like one type of animal over another.\n",
      "So they’ll exclusively take cats, or a particular kind of cat?\n",
      "Interviewee: Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer: Or does it tend to be like difficulty saying no to any animal?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, no, no. I mean I’m not going to say it’s a (INAUDIBLE 30:50) rule, but it certainly preponderates where people do one or the other.\n",
      "Now, the first case I saw that I told you about that was maybe a little bit of (INAUDIBLE 31:00).\n",
      "The lady had thirteen dogs and seventy-two cats.\n",
      "Most of the time I would say there’s a predominant animal and there may be some other ancillary animals that are part of the piece.\n",
      "But it does seem like one type or one class of animal maybe they’re a farm animal, cattle or goats, but there’s especially when we find a domestic farm, it tends to be one or the other most of the time, at least predominantly if not exclusively.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do people tend to once they have chosen what animal it is that they’re acquiring, do they tend to distinguish within that?\n",
      "Like they’re looking for a particular kind of dog that they want to acquire or a particular breed?\n",
      "Interviewee: There are people who again and we didn’t really investigate them (INAUDIBLE 31:55) but there was a subset that we started to talk about with a disorder was somebody that was at one point a professional dog breeder and a particular breed they were focusing on may be the type of the dog they showed and somewhere along the line it degenerated and they ended up being a hoarder with that breed.\n",
      "And then, when I was about 35, I bought a townhouse, and for the first few years, that could be cleaned up for company, and multiple uses.\n",
      "When I was about ...\n",
      "It started getting much worse when I was probably about 50, maybe 45.\n",
      "I guess we could say 45, it started getting worse, because I started having more income, for one thing.\n",
      "And so, it just gradually got worse, so that at one point, in about 2001, I had bariatric surgery, and a bunch of my friends came in and helped me get my house set up so that I could be home for a month from the surgery, and use my kitchen and whatnot.\n",
      "And that was the first time I'd ever had anybody help me with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So it kind of sounds like it's been going on your whole life, but it was maybe more manageable when you were younger?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Yeah, it's been going on my whole life, but it's been much worse as the years progress.\n",
      "So it's worse since the surgery, to the point where now, we'll jump from 2000 to now, there's literally ...\n",
      "Well, except that I've been working on it, which I'll get to in a second.\n",
      "There's trails through the house.\n",
      "You could really not get in the front door very easily.\n",
      "You had to know what to climb over, and follow the little trails of the steps upstairs, and my chair was filled with stuff.\n",
      "I couldn't use my living room.\n",
      "I couldn't even ...\n",
      "Six weeks ago, I couldn't even get into the kitchen.\n",
      "There was a bunch of stuff piled in front of the door to the entrance.\n",
      "So it's been very, very restricted for, I'd say, the last four years.\n",
      "I don't think I've used the kitchen for four years.\n",
      "I couldn't use the living room.\n",
      "I used an office and the bedroom, and those two had little trails through them.\n",
      "You can't see much floor.\n",
      "Six weeks ago, I did have a friend, who I employed once a week to come in and help me, so now I can get in the kitchen.\n",
      "And I'm in the process of cleaning out the refrigerator.\n",
      "In fact, I emptied it.\n",
      "I decided just to totally throw out everything that was in it.\n",
      "After four years, what would you want to keep?\n",
      "And it's almost totally cleaned out, so I'm ready to go buy some food and fill it up.\n",
      "So I'm ready to use the kitchen now, so that's progress.\n",
      "And I can use part of the living room, and then I come up to my little pathway through the bedroom and stay up here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever sought professional help for this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, some questions.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Am I still being recorded?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, I will-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... stop that when we end the conversation.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "This is to help with the information we get as well.\n",
      "So what is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Female?\n",
      "Is that the same as your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, okay.\n",
      "What is your race and ethnicity?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "White, Caucasian.\n",

      "Non-Hispanic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is the highest degree of education, or highest level of education that you have completed?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Well I've got a high school certificate, but I've got a bunch of college credits.\n",
      "I just haven't passed math, and so probably-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Some college?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, I've got college credits, I just can't math, so I never got a degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is approximately your household income?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "By myself, over 120,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what geographic region do you live in in the US?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "San Francisco Bay area, California.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "West Coast.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "One second.\n",
      "Once again, thank you for participating in our study.\n",
      "We really appreciate you taking the time to help us understand the disorder.\n",
      "We're happy to get knowledge and learn about different people's attitudes towards hoarding disorder.\n",
      "I hope you have a great day.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",

      "Oh, well thank you very much, and hopefully this COVID will be over with pretty soon, so take care of yourself and thank you for the call.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Once again, I would like to remind you, you will be receiving compensation, and if you have any other questions or anything you'd like to follow up with, just contact the head of the study, who you initially contacted to enroll in.\n",

      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: No, absolutely.\n",
      "And I wonder if you could take a step back and think through that for me.\n",
      "You know if you were to really think about where you are in your understanding of what causes this.\n",
      "So, for example, some clinicians will talk about hoarding as being a biological impulse whereas some will talk about it as a response to trauma or a coping mechanism.\n",
      "So, it really seems to be a question of whether the justification for saving animals is a real justification or whether it’s kind of a post-hope justification for some underlying biology that has gone wrong.\n",
      "Do you have a sense for…?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s probably complex and I don’t think this necessarily has to be a one-size-fits-all explanation.\n",
      "We certainly do see cases where people start out with good intentions and trying to do the right thing, whether it’s some kind of rescue or shelter and saving the animals.\n",
      "But then either because of space, if they can’t adopt enough of them out, choose to start becoming more selective and they don’t want to let the animals go, the collection starts to rise, and then at some point they do spin out of control where they’re just overwhelmed and they have far too many and they don’t know how to get out of that.\n",
      "(INAUDIBLE 23:50-24:05) Hard to know, but there’s a lot of self-type of reward I guess is what I’m saying by doing it, both internal and external and those rewards probably differ a little bit by different people.\n",
      "Now some people may know people that are more passive about it, some people tend to be more passive acquirers whereas the lady that lives at the end of the road, dead-end road, and everybody drops off strays there because they know that she’ll take it in.\n",
      "But then you have people who are more actively soliciting animals through bulletin boards or social media now etc and deliberately trying to build their collection.\n",
      "Some of them are not sole actors but they become group actors and they seem to almost have a cult-like following of enablers and different animals.\n",
      "So, there’s many different variations out there.\n",
      "What we see is the common denominator in the end-behavior.\n",
      "I think it’s premature and probably not productive to assume that identical processes always lead to that end-behavior.\n",
      "It’s just the end-behavior that we can recognize so that’s the label we end up using.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s a really good point.\n",
      "I wonder if you could talk me through some of the explanations that people give for their behavior when they’re confronted by charges of animal neglect.\n",
      "Interviewee: There usually isn’t an explanation.\n",
      "Actually, I think you can get it on our website.\n",
      "If not, if you look at the (NAME 25:37) website we have a publication list that I can certainly send you anything you’d like to see.\n",
      "My colleague (NAME 25:43) the sociologist actually did a whole paper analyzing excuses.\n",
      "So, he talked about that, but a lot of times there’s so little insight that you could be standing there, this has happened to me personally, when you literally pass dead animals on the floor and they’re looking around not seeing any problem.\n",
      "So that’s how profound the lack of insight can be.\n",
      "So, it’s some place (INAUDIBLE 26:07) irrelevant but (NAME 26:12) did a whole paper of excuses.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I live in a split level home, three-bedroom, two-bath home.\n",
      "And I'm on almost five acres of land.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, and out of town a little way.\n",
      "Yeah, it's great.\n",
      "I love it, love it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do you live alone?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, I live alone.\n",
      "Yeah, I'm single and always have been.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what would you like your home to look like in terms of... I know that you said that you would like everything to have a place.\n",
      "So, can you expand on that notion a little bit?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Well, yeah.\n",
      "All these horizontal surfaces that are covered with stuff, I want to be clear and open.\n",
      "I really like open space and a sense of having elbow room and that's part of why I got a place on five acres instead of in town where my house is right next door and close to somebody else.\n",
      "But I want the inside of my house to feel that way too.\n",
      "And so, yeah I want my dining room table to not be covered with books and paperwork and my laptop and all that.\n",
      "It'd be so nice to just have a bouquet of flowers on it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And so, you said your countertops, your horizontal surfaces.\n",
      "What about your floors?\n",
      "Are you able to walk around pretty easily without bumping into things or having to reroute?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, fortunately, yes.\n",
      "I haven't gotten to that extreme where I've blocked my passageways and all that.\n",
      "So, no, I'm able to...\n",
      "The floors are pretty good, not perfect but I will say there's a lot of stuff.\n",
      "I do call it an obstacle course sometimes but a lot of it is things for my cats.\n",
      "I have two cats and I spoil them rotten and so I have cat towers and cat chairs and cat beds and cat toys.\n",
      "So, there is a lot... A lot of the clutter I will say is cat-related and that probably won't change very much but I don't know.\n",
      "But as far as my stuff...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so your floors are pretty good.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:24:40] yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Like if you didn't have your objects with you would you still feel comfortable and feel like you are in your home?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "If I didn't have my what with me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your objects.\n",
      "So, say like your-\n",
      "Interview 005\n",
      "P1: Hey how are you?\n",
      "P3: I’m good how are you?\n",
      "P1: Doing good, how’s the conference been going?\n",
      "P3: Ugh, I’m just ready to be done (laughing).\n",
      "P1:(laughing) (0:42)\n",
      "P3: Uh you want to do the nineteenth at twelve thirty for doctor NAME?\n",
      "(0:45)\n",
      "P1: Yeah even to twelve thirty.\n",
      "P3: I’ll put it on the calendar, do you want me to reply to her, NAME (0:56)?\n",
      "P1: Um I think I did, did I CC you on that?\n",
      "P3: Yeah, I just missed it, hm yeah I just missed it.\n",
      "P1: Let me double check.\n",
      "Interviewee: I see it.\n",
      "P1: Yeah okay, alright so were going to alternate questions after you do the free listing prompt and intro?\n",
      "P3: Mhm\n",
      "P1: Do you want to do the most important features one or do you want to start alternating at that point?\n",
      "P3: Uh yeah, I think i'll do, I’ll just intro the subject the study and the free listing, and then I’ll say can you just give us some background and then after that you can take it away.\n",
      "P1: Okay\n",
      "P3: Okay\n",
      "P1: Yeah that sounds like a plan.\n",
      "Okay I will go ahead and give her a buzz and get this started.\n",
      "P3: INAUDIBLE (1:52) I didn’t tell you this yesterday but like, probably isn’t the right word but I was I was very clear INAUDIBLE (2:00), and I was like I really like working with NAME (2:02) he’s like he’s got it straight in order INAUDIBLE (2:05).\n",
      "We didn’t talk about this he did it exactly right I think it worked way better with the little summary at the end.\n",
      "P1: Yeah I literally I’d pull up the notes that um I’d taken from the day that we talked about it I was like shit I gotta make sure I did this right.\n",
      "P3: Yeah no, you did a great job and um I like I just had like a moment of pleasure of working with you and being like: he took notes and that’s what he’s doing, and did it exactly right so (laughing) thank you for doing that.\n",
      "I I realize that we hadn’t like talked about it before going into the interview I think it went off great went on great.\n",
      "P1: Yeah yeah I think it did-\n",
      "P3: Anyway\n",
      "P1: INAUDIBLE (2:43) definitely helped definitely so hopefully this one will be even better.\n",
      "I’ll go ahead and give her a call, okay?\n",
      "P3: Uhuh\n",
      "P1: Also just so you know all of this is recorded so I now have record of you complimenting me.\n",
      "P3: (laughing) oh good, (laughing) how awkward.\n",
      "P1: Alright, I think we’re all on the line together now.\n",
      "P3: Okay hi.\n",
      "Interviewee: Hi\n",
      "P3: Its nice to meet you, I’m NAME, I’m a colleague of NAME.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "P3: How are you?\n",
      "Interviewee: Good, how are you NAME?\n",
      "P3: I’m doing well.\n",
      "Um I I guess I’ll just start by introducing a little bit about the project that we’re doing-\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "P3: And then we a have a its like a informed consent script for you to listen to-\n",
      "Interviewee: uhuh\n",
      "P3: And decide if you’d like to participate and then we'll get started with the interview okay?\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay\n",
      "P3: And if at any point um you can’t hear me or understand what I’m saying, because I’m in a kinda weird location, um I’m at a conference right now, so if you can't hear me just let me know um-\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay\n",
      "P3: So just to give you the background information NAME and I are kind of trying to understand um how patients and clinicians understand hoarding disorder, and how understanding hoarding might differ between clinicians and patients.\n",
      "So right now were kinda we kinda split into two phases, and the phase that were working on right now is the clinician’s perspectives so that’s why were um interviewing you, we will eventually want to compare these interviews with um interview that we do with patients.\n",
      "And so some of the questions that we ask may be a little odd, but the idea is to compare what clinicians will say in response to these questions to what patients will say.\n",
      "So that’s the intent of of our project, um we’re also kind of interested in how knowledge about hoarding disorder is spreading between researchers and clinicians who have different um different amount of ya know experience and and knowledge of um hoarding, so that’s another thing that were interested in.\n",
      "So that’s kind of a background for our project and our intention.\n",
      "Um if you have any questions through the project uh we can happy to answer them otherwise I can go ahead and read you the informed consent uh\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "And my house is not crawling with bugs, or really dirty.\n",
      "It's not pristine by any measure but I do not like dirty dishes lying around, and I do the dishes.\n",
      "I don't like things that start smelling or anything.\n",
      "Yeah, I don't have those issues.\n",
      "I'm not super tidy and the dishes might take a day to do, but they don't take a week to do, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You have better standards than me.\n",
      "Do the items that you have, you said it doesn't bother your husband, does it bother any of your other family members?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "I have an adult daughter who moved back in a year ago and no, it doesn't bother her.\n",
      "We have to tell her how to not get in our space with her stuff.\n",
      "She's not supposed to, she has to do her own laundry, for example, and do her own dishes, and sometimes we have to tell her, \"You can't put your coffee mug there.\n",
      "That's dad's space for his grocery list and his,\" whatever.\n",
      "\"If you're putting your coffee mug down, put it down in your own room, or wash it and put it in your space.\"\n",
      "But no, it doesn't bother her.\n",
      "But she's basically just living upstairs in our house, because she has a job now as a dementia care helper.\n",
      "She works in a facility, and so we stay pretty separate from her.\n",
      "Mostly.\n",
      "She does come down to our kitchen, put her groceries away, and anyway, no. My way does not bother her but she's used to it, and because she's a renter here, she can't really complain.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like more so you've identified the collecting of items is causing discomfort to you, not because it upsets your loved ones or impacts your relationships, but more because of the discomfort it causes you of having others come into your home or possibly passing judgment.\n",
      "Does that seem accurate?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, the garage expansion to me taking over half of the garage has been an issue.\n",
      "Not like it was going to break up our marriage, but it has bothered me husband, and so we've negotiated through that.\n",
      "He's very tolerant.\n",
      "I think certain things might kind of bug him.\n",
      "I know certain things bug him, because sometimes he says, \"Do you think you're really going to use that whole box of drift wood that's in the garage?\" And I'll say, \"Well, I've used one piece in the last two months, and I like all the other ones.\"\n",
      "And he's like, \"Did you remember you have another box of driftwood under that other table?\" And I'm like, \"Oh yeah, I remember.\"\n",
      "He's like, \"Okay, whatever.\"\n",
      "You know, it's like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It doesn't actively come to a head, it's just probably, it's mentioned from time to time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, last one of these little story things.\n",
      "So, John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.\n",
      "He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.\n",
      "Antiques occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "So, is Mr. Doe a hoarder?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "That's hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And do you think he should try to change his behavior and why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh man, yeah.\n",
      "Definitely change his behavior because again it's a dangerous situation it seems to me if you can't walk through your house and can't get to your bathroom.\n",
      "And yeah, I mean, gosh, it's probably a fire hazard and all kinds of things to have that much furniture.\n",
      "I'm assuming...\n",
      "When I think of antiques, I figure they're going to be made of wood probably but that's not necessarily true.\n",
      "They can be made of metal or other things but anyway.\n",
      "So yeah, and to not be able to find what you need in a timely fashion is also...\n",
      "It can be dangerous and it's certainly inconsiderate when it comes to not getting to appointments or commitments on time or at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely, mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So, do you think that he needs treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and did you find any similarities or differences to your own behavior?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "That one was pretty different, it felt pretty different to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, he does antiques, which have a lot of value to him.\n",
      "Did you find any similarities as to like the value you place on the old books from your family heirlooms?\n",
      "Did you find any similarities there or not really?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: That’s a really interesting distinction.\n",
      "I can see why that would make the brown assessment scale to not work as well.\n",
      "Do you feel like there are some subgroups within hoarding disorder that would be, that are different in terms of insights?\n",
      "We’ve talked about a lot of ways of potentially subdividing people within, you know, that there’s a variety, that you find that some of the subgroups have an easier time recognizing their behavior as presenting a problem or harder time.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "I think, honestly, that it’s all from less severe, those from the less severe problem that may recognize it more easily.\n",
      "Possibly those with, uh, no I’m going to take that back.\n",
      "That doesn’t work.\n",
      "Yeah, I, uh, you know, at the same time I also think the level of awareness is going to be on a continuum and people will sometimes realize that they need to fix something, especially in certain emotional states, and other times be unable to see why anybody, you know…Why don’t I just say that one of the challenges we brought into in terms of differences among people is that people who have been pressured heavily to get rid of things against their will and without taking their wish to save into account, often will have a major reaction in which they say I don’t have a problem.\n",
      "But you can’t trust that because if you could calm them down and get them to not be anxious about what somebody would do to them or to their object, they would often be able to say well, you know, it really is kind of too much stuff and I do need to do something about it.\n",
      "But at the same time, nobody has the right to tell them to do that.\n",
      "So it will vary depending on their experience of pressure that they find intrusive, invasive, and problematic.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok, um, I’d like to step in and ask a question kind of relating back to what you mentioned earlier about what the meaning of insight is in the context of hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So in the literature, there’s been kind of a breakdown of the concept of insight into different constructs including defensiveness, anosognosia overvalued ideation, and indifference.\n",
      "In your experience, are any of these more prevalent or problematic in your work with individuals with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok, let’s go down that list NAME [52:24].\n",
      "The first one you said was…\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Defensiveness.\n",
      "Interviewee: Defensiveness… I think you’re going to find that, ok clearly, commonly, but let’s come back to that.\n",
      "What was the next one?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Anosognosia.\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, yeah, I’m going to say that that’s a little rarer.\n",
      "Go ahead, what’s the next one?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Overvalued ideation.\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, that would be overvaluing the objects themselves.\n",
      "That’s where I always get into trouble with this one, overvalued ideation.\n",
      "What’s the ideation we’re talking about here?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, I think my understanding from the literature is that it relates to kind of that attachment to that object that you described.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "And a belief in the need to keep it for some reason.\n",
      "You know, here we’re getting into emotion versus belief in it.\n",
      "It’s a little tricky distinction to make.\n",
      "Um, yeah, go ahead, it’s hard to say.\n",
      "What was the last one?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: The last one was indifference.\n",
      "Interviewee: And what did you mean by indifference?\n",
      "Indifference to what?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Indifference to the state of the home, the living situation that they’re in.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right.\n",
      "This next one says, John Doe has magazines that he keeps in case he needs to use them in the future.\n",
      "Magazines occupy most of his rooms, except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these magazines from his bathtub.\n",
      "Sometimes it's difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them, until eventually he finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he's usually late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "What do you think on the spectrum?\n",
      "Is this more like clutter problems or a full blown hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Magazines are in the bathtub, I think that goes a little beyond clutter, and if he's always, if he's almost always late because he can't find things.\n",
      "Also being... I think it is a little beyond clutter, and it's kind of going over into the hoarding category.\n",
      "I think also if somebody, if this happens chronically that it takes you 20 minutes to find things, and you're always late, I think if he's not able to come up with a system, where at least the vitally important things are always in the same place, but that shows that there's a little bit more of a problem also.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think he should seek treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "I mean because magazines in the bathtub is kind of really what, I think when the clutter moves from where it could sort of normally be expected into other places, where it interferes with your ability to function.\n",
      "I think that that could mean there's underlying issues that would benefit from some professional help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think that this is similar to your behavior in any way or mostly different?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yes, it's different.\n",
      "I don't usually have a hard time finding things like keys.\n",
      "I tend to keep things like that in the same place, and I tend to use rooms for what they're intended.\n",
      "I don't use my bathroom for storage.\n",
      "I think that's a little different than my situation.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This last one is John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them, and he knows that they are valuable.\n",
      "He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "He's worried he might get rid of an antique item that's worth a lot of money, and antiques occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often it's difficult for him to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until eventually he finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Where do you think he fits on this spectrum?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok. And can you tell us what your educational background is?\n",
      "Interviewee: I have a PhD in clinical psychology.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And so do you see patients with hoarding disorder clinically as well as conducting research?\n",
      "Interviewee: I only see patients clinically in connection with a research study or as, in a supervisory capacity at a supervised therapist, at a local mental health center that has an OCD center where we treat hoarding.\n",
      "So I don’t see the individual patients outside the context of some kind of research project other than that supervision.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "NAME [17:08] would you like to take over with the…\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah sure.\n",
      "Hi again, kind of to echo what NAME [17:16] said at the start of this call, we have both really enjoyed reading your work.\n",
      "And just to add to his little background, the next question of the interview: we’re trying to kind of understand the state of kind of, kind of a stratise on hoarding disorder right now to kind of see where the consensus is and on the different practitioners and how different people think about hoarding disorder as a kind of, um, you know, is becoming more recognized and more standardized as a disorder.\n",
      "And then our goal is to see how hoarders themselves understand the disorder in order to understand, perhaps, disjunct between patient understanding and physician understanding in order to try to address problems with insight, or low insight, in patient population.\n",
      "Some of these questions might be a little weird, but it might be helpful to think that, or to know for you that we’re going to ask patients these same questions and then the idea is to compare.\n",
      "So, with that little disclaimer, we would just like to kind of start off pretty broadly by asking you what the most important differences are between normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder in your mind?\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "The basic difference between normal collecting and hoarding, uh, there are a couple.\n",
      "First is the variety of possessions that are collected.\n",
      "In normal collecting, the objects or possessions typically have a theme and those…it’s a restricted number of themes that collectors imploy.\n",
      "In hoarding disorder, there are…there may be themes but there are multiple themes.\n",
      "And for many people with hoarding disorder, there aren’t, um, there aren’t themes at all, it sort of applies to almost everything that comes into the person’s possession.\n",
      "The narrowness of the category of objects that are saved is one dimension on which these things differ.\n",
      "The other is the way in which the objects are collected.\n",
      "In collecting behavior, it is more planful and targeted.\n",
      "In hoarding disorder, the collection is more impulsive.\n",
      "There is also a difference in volume that people with hoarding disorder, for the most part, have much more volume of possessions than people who collect.\n",
      "Um, let’s see…related to that, that it’s the way in which the objects are displayed different.\n",
      "In collecting, those objects are displayed in an organized fashion and there is an interest in displaying objects for other people to see and admire.\n",
      "In hoarding disorder, the objects are typically arrayed in what appears to be a confused and unorganized manner, and there is typically very little interest.\n",
      "In fact, maybe just the opposite.\n",
      "Very little interest in allowing other people to see those objects.\n",
      "So those are the major differences.\n",
      "P3: Um and I just wanna get started on our kind of more reform interview by having you um just give a little bit of info about your background related to hoarding disorder, um and how you’ve become involved.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm okay.\n",
      "So I um my PhD was in PTSD, and so when I was looking for jobs I saw the INAUDIBLE (21:21) post at INAUDIBLE (21:23) at the time hiring postdoc to do article to be involved in clinical trials she was working on, so then I applied and then I got in, so I went and worked in that context for three uh three years and and three months I think three years and four months something like that yeah.\n",
      "So I my involvement in the in the um in the clinical trial was to for people with hoarding problems, yeah and so that finished um in 2014 so that’s when it started and it finished in 2017.\n",
      "And so in the course of that course of three years and something months, I uh ran maybe uh fifteen sixteen groups INAUDIBLE (22:31) groups and this intent more than a hundred people with hoarding problems homes.\n",
      "Yeah so that was my experience and after that um now I’m in the process of getting my license in California on working with this type of system, and continuing to see people with hoarding problems but also something else.\n",
      "Yeah that's it.\n",
      "P1: Mkay um so for the rest of the interview uh NAME (23:03) and I are going to kinda be alternating off with asking you some different questions, and the one that we wanted to start off with is, uh what are the most important features of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm um this is different from any of the previous answers of previous questions or or?\n",
      "P1: Yeah, yeah I guess what were kind of trying to get at with this one is what are the differences that are really important and differentiating between normal saving behavior and pathological hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ah okay hm, so I think one of these would be um would be the the psychological reasons for not getting rid of things or for keeping things so for for example for collecting behaviors, the underlying mechanism would be would be would be very different from hoarding and um so and with hording the collection is more um to deal with um sentimental reasons and more emotional and more fear based, and and it creates a lot of shame, but compare with um um um collecting behaviors, like healthy collecting behaviors, is more more uh got a lot of pride it's not as much shame and um and also with hoarding um its yeah, it's more the psychological reasons of not getting rid of things more that the physical capacity or practical concerns.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So in thinking about those criteria, although I know you haven’t like physically applied them, you have clearly given them a great deal of thought.\n",
      "Do you think that there are things in the criteria that are sometimes challenging or um difficult to apply or that perhaps clinicians with different levels of experience with patients with HD might apply differently?\n",
      "Does anything come to mind?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, the only thing that occurs to me is the need, once you verify that there’s clutter in the home and that it interferes with function, it’s really the differential diagnosis that seems to me to be important because hoarding disorder requires that there be a, um, a hard requirement to have difficulty letting go of objects and that can sometimes be a little bit hard to distinguish, whether the rationale that you’re hearing people describe matches our understanding of, again, a wide variety of reasons why people have trouble letting go.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhmm, mmhmm\n",
      "Interviewee: And so you can hear multiple different reasons for that, that you want to make sure the difficulty parting with objects gets a pattern.\n",
      "That’s all I can think of at this point.\n",
      "The clutter part is pretty straight forward.\n",
      "There’s, you know, an acquisition is only a best fire at this point.\n",
      "We struggle with them because we felt that current and post hoc positions should be a part of criteria but, oh well, you know, it’s the best fire.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so now I actually want to look at some of the criteria and to get you to talk through how you make these determinations, and again this is because we’d like to understand if that there are differences in the way that clinicians think about this as opposed to the way patients do.\n",
      "So one of the criteria says that the patient must have persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value.\n",
      "And I guess one of the things we were wondering about is how clinicians make the determination that it has actual value?\n",
      "What makes the value judgement an individual with hoarding disorder makes inappropriate?\n",
      "Um, like, because we can think of many different kinds of value, like monetary value, emotional value, aesthetic value that can be, you know, really subjective.\n",
      "So, um, in a clinician’s area, what do we mean by value?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say it doesn’t really matter what you mean by value because it’s regardless of their actual value, so you don’t really care what the actual value is.\n",
      "You just care that the person values them in some way, shape, or form for those various reasons you just mentioned.\n",
      "And as long as the person has trouble letting them go, parting with them, or whatever we decide to call it, you don’t care why.\n",
      "Do you see what I mean?\n",
      "It’s interesting to us to know why, but, you know, monetary values got nothing to do with it, aesthetic value doesn’t have anything to do.\n",
      "It’s whatever they think.\n",
      "They want it.\n",
      "As long as they want it, so be it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So people could hoard something that’s, you know, objectively valuable?\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh yeah.\n",
      "You could hoard oil paintings.\n",
      "P1: Okay um can you tell us you know what kind of people are are more likely to be hoarders is it older or younger individuals, people of a certain race, or socioeconomic status, people living in rural or urban settings?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm um the the rate of hoarding disorder increase as the age increases and um its al lot more common, it’s a lot more prevalent with people who are fifty-five years older or sixty years uh older than sixty or fifty-five years old, and um yeah so in that age range is more its like six or seven percent, but in general then it's more like two two percent so among the older folks its more common and um a lot of these folks are more um, they have lower income, um but it doesn’t mean that rich people don’t have hoarding problems, and um a lot of these folks are also uh not able to keep their jobs yeah.\n",
      "In terms of whether its more urban or rural this one I’m not quite sure.\n",
      "P1: Mkay and were there any other things outside of those that you think a certain type of person would be more likely to be a hoarder?\n",
      "Interviewee: My observation is that a lot of people with hoarding problems the are quiet creative, they are kinda like they are kind of artistic, and they can see fine details that that other people don’t see.\n",
      "P1: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah INAUDIBLE (26:59) answer to this question.\n",
      "P1: Okay no um definitely definitely, now can you think of any specific cases that have been challenging to diagnose, either clinically or for research purposes, because it was on the border between pathological and nonpathological, and how you made that distinction?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah there was a recent case, that uh um the reason why she it was hard to diagnose for her was um she um um her clutter was based on based on her description, that based on her reasoning was to to lack of money to afford storage unit, and recently she had a lot of loss uh family member died in the past five or six years and she had a lot of um PTSD symptoms and depression, and so and the timing of the of the clutter starting kind of um was around the time when all of that was happening when all the very obvious PTSD and major depression symptoms were starting and also, she had to spend all her saving flying to different parts of the country to funerals, so she couldn’t afford storage unit anymore and she had to move things to her very small studio, and so she so it uh it was hard to tell whether the clutter was was um because of these financial and other diagnoses or was because of hoarding, yeah.\n",
      "P1: Okay okay.\n",
      "Some of it I would've done anyway about the cleaning out my clothes closet, straightening things, going through some of my stuff and boxing them, so there was another time I did box stuff that was kitchen things, extra kitchen things that I hadn't used for a long time, to thrift, and that wasn't so hard because I don't have a lot of sentimental attachment to kitchen things.\n",
      "I could easily look at them and go, \"Oh, I haven't used this for two years.\n",
      "Why is it still in the drawer?\n",
      "Okay, you're gone.\"\n",
      "Because I have two others that I might use, you know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I also do not have a sentimental attachment to my kitchen items, so I can understand that.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Anyway, so that was useful, and that helped me put some perspective on my tendencies.\n",
      "At that point, I already had some perspective, but I shared it with a stranger who I really liked, this coach person, and it was interesting to share that and talk about it each week.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it seems like that's probably the most uncomfortable portion of it for you, so I'm glad that you were able to find someone that you felt was comfortable to just air whatever you wanted to with.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, but I would never invite her to my house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Baby steps.\n",
      "Okay, so as now, during this time where you're spending maybe a little bit more time at home, has it made you feel more connected to the items in your house, since you're looking at them more often and around them?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "No, it's actually made me feel like it's time to trade them out, and maybe even to decide if I can get rid of some of them, possibly.\n",
      "I'd definitely trade them out because I have a box or more upstairs in my studio of things I haven't looked at for quite a while, and this would be a good time to get them out and look at them and remember things, so yeah, definitely in my living room I have these kind of mantle cubbyhole things that I designed when we renovated our living room, so I could put my treasures in them.\n",
      "I have not actually been seeing them for some months.\n",
      "I'm looking at them now, and they make me happy, but yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I like that you use, whenever you described it to me, when you first described this concept of having items and really enjoying the uniqueness and the aesthetic view of them collectively, whenever you use them as decoration, but it gets to a certain point, I think in anyone's home probably too, where you do stop seeing them.\n",
      "They become invisible, in a sense, because you're so used to them.\n",
      "That's an interesting concept.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I need to redecorate my place, now that you say that.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Usually, I just run out with some sort of distraction I guess.\n",
      "I mean my husband is great.\n",
      "He's a great comfort to me, but I don't...\n",
      "It's funny.\n",
      "If there's something disturbing happens, mostly, I try to avoid thinking about it I guess for comfort.\n",
      "I'll do something mindless I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Kind of like a distraction?\n",
      "At least like a...\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you're seeing your...\n",
      "You said you see your parents weekly.\n",
      "Are there any other family or friends that you keep in contact with at this time?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, okay.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "We keep in contact with my husbands parents too, but that's somewhat less frequent, mostly they don't need us as much, but we talk to them from time to time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel socially isolated or lonely in general?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I've always been kind of introverted so this doesn't really feel... I mean we've cut down on social interactions, but it doesn't really feel that bad to me I guess.\n",
      "I don't really feel that isolated or lonely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, did you feel that way in general prior to COVID and there's just no change or just in general, you just prefer?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah, I'd say there's no change.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I think that's mostly it.\n",
      "I'm just trying to make sure...\n",
      "Any conflicts with masks or social distancing?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "That's good to hear.\n",
      "I think that's it on my end.\n",
      "Is there anything that I didn't ask about that you think is worth mentioning?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, not that I can think of.\n",
      "I think you did a pretty thorough job.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "We have a nice basic question outline that was developed that was I think fairly thorough.\n",
      "Next, I'm just going to get some just basic demographic stuff.\n",
      "It should be very, very quick.\n",
      "Then I'll just ask you for some information we need just to send the payment your way.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is that the same as the sex you were assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What race do you identify with?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Caucasian, white, whatever.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Either is fine.\n",
      "Then do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Then do you have a range or an estimate for your yearly household income?\n",
      "If it helps, I can provide some general ranges.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "It's over 100K, 100,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Over 100,000.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Then as far as regions of the... I guess I'll get it from your address, but what state do you currently live in?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "State?\n",
      "Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Pennsylvania, okay.\n",
      "Then highest level of education that you've obtained?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Bachelor's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Bachelor's.\n",
      "Then let me go ahead and turn this off.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Another thing to kind of follow off that that I was struck by in your book, and to go off that idea of giftedness, I got the sense that, in addition to being overly aesthetic, they were also overly empathetic.\n",
      "That was also kind of a trait that was common, that they empathize too much with things that maybe you shouldn’t necessarily empathize with, but they felt that objects really had more, kind of, feeling and felt for them.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "And I’ve been working on a couple of projects now with a couple of individuals looking more deeply at their experience.\n",
      "And they’re very different.\n",
      "One is sort of material scrupulosity and the other has a sentimental kind of attachment.\n",
      "But they each talk about believing that they are an empath, and, you know, empaths, I guess in the Star Trek sets, but empaths for objects, and for people as well, but it’s quite interesting and no one has really looked into that.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Do you find that that empathy extends to people, for people who have this trait, that they are also overly empathetic to people, or is it really objects?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I don’t know.\n",
      "For these two, they’re insistence is that it generates to people.\n",
      "I don’t know, I don’t know that I’ve seen that that often, but according to them it does.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Well, we kind of wanted to close out our talk today by kind of stepping back from the interview.\n",
      "Those were all the interview questions that we had.\n",
      "And [NAME 38:33] feel free to jump in.\n",
      "And we were kind of thinking forward through the next stages of our project and we wanted to talk about the project a little bit.\n",
      "[INAUDIBLE 38:43] your input into it and kind of see if you would be willing to help us moving forward just to think through some of these issues when start to do our interviews with hoarders.\n",
      "I don’t know, [NAME 38:56] do you want to jump in?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "I guess so the next stage for us after we were planning on going back and looking through our clinician interviews and maybe reframing and refocusing some of our interview questions in order to get at pieces that haven’t reached thematic saturation yet and see if there are more opinions that we can gather.\n",
      "And, kind of moving forward to develop our patient interview, I guess we were thinking that, if you would be so inclined, that perhaps we could get in touch with you again at that point down the road since you have already spent a considerable amount of time thinking on these things especially when it comes to the insight piece and just kind of having you look through or take a look at our patient interview to see if, based on from your experience, we’d be able to get at the things we were trying to get at with this population.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure, I’d be happy to do that.\n",
      "With this age of eBay and everybody selling everything, I don't know that that's even exactly true.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:24:33] like we've unearthed stuff in everybody's attic, so that lowers the value of these items.\n",
      "In terms of the items like yarn and yogurt cartons and the things that virtually have no financial value or restored value, but I feel they might be useful, it just comes down to can I think of a use for them?\n",
      "Can I think of a craft project for them?\n",
      "That's how I determine if I'll keep it.\n",
      "If I can think of a project I would like to do with it, then I keep it in case I might do that project.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's about it, I think.\n",
      "That gives me a good understanding of how you determine the value of objects.\n",
      "On the flip side of that, how do you decide what's trash?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "That is a good question because I'm sure if you thought hard enough, you could find a use for almost anything.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I mean there is a point where I have too much of something, and so I say, \"No, I'm not going to keep any more of these.\"\n",
      "I guess if I just never considered it useful, then I throw it out.\n",
      "I mean we actually did kind of a purge last month.\n",
      "My kids wanted to have a yard sale, which I've always found to be a pretty low return on investment with yard sales, but the thing good thing is that after the yard sale, we had a bunch of stuff, and we just completely got rid of it.\n",
      "Even though it was stuff like...\n",
      "There was a futon that some hardware had been missing for, and even though I can think of it as useful, I can admit the fact that since we do not want that piece of furniture anymore and clearly nobody wanted to buy a futon with missing hardware, that we could put that into the trash, that it was time for that to, that we had to put that into the trash, no matter how useful it looked, no matter how nice the cover was.\n",
      "It was valueless to anybody at all.\n",
      "It was just taking up a huge amount of space in our basement.\n",
      "It took me a lot of... I think it was around for a couple of years before I came to that realization, but I finally was able to convince myself that the only place for that huge piece of furniture to go was out with the garbage on a Wednesday morning.\n",
      "I can be convinced eventually that something is valueless, but it takes a lot of trying to find someone else who might want it.\n",
      "Then if you can't, you know it's got to go I guess.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, we haven’t, but [NAME 18:06] and [NAME 18:07] and I spent a couple years trying to develop these, and we came up with a whole series of questions and just were never satisfied that they captured what we intended with insight.\n",
      "And I think at the time we weren’t quite sure how to define it, in fact we have a paper on that talking about the notion of insight in hoarding.\n",
      "It’s just a real tricky thing to try to figure out.\n",
      "So, good luck.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, we’ve kind of used your paper as a starting point for a lot of our own thinking about it.\n",
      "It’s interesting to hear you talk about it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, it’s really, I think it’s a really hard problem to solve.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: But, you know, I guess to kind of think through the problem a step further, it seems like it would be a very important problem to address because of the problems getting people into treatment and into research and sticking to treatment.\n",
      "So, is your sense, and this is not on our interview script but just as a question, along those lines that insight is the biggest, kind of, block to getting people into treatment, that people, once they’re aware that they have a problem they have an easier time with things?\n",
      "Or is that not the case?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t know.\n",
      "You know, whenever we’ve put out a call for research we get flooded with people with hoarding problems, so I’m not sure that insight is the impediment.\n",
      "I think shame may be more than insight.\n",
      "I think the majority of people know there’s something wrong.\n",
      "They don’t know how to explain it.\n",
      "They don’t know what it is, and maybe they don’t want to call it hoarding, because that’s… you know, there are lots of negative connotation with that term.\n",
      "So, I don’t know that insight is the biggest impediment to getting people into treatment.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "And so, the biggest impediment would then be getting people to admit they have a problem… I don’t know.\n",
      "Where would you locate the problem if it’s not [INAUDIBLE 20:29]?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s more what is available to help people.\n",
      "I mean, there are relatively few therapists who know how to treat this or advertise themselves knowing how to treat it, very few centers which do so, and so where people turn?\n",
      "Where does an [INAUDIBLE 20:53] turn when they have a hoarding problem?\n",
      "By in large, it’s not the mental health system, they go to case management systems, they go to, you know, places like Steri-Clean and things of that sort because those are the only options they know of.\n",
      "Those are the only places that have any advertising.\n",
      "So, I think part of the problem is there just aren’t resources available, and the other part, I think, is shame.\n",
      "It’s like going to the dentist, nobody, you know, people avoid going to the dentist just because it’s… you know, they don’t like it.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Well the next kind of couple of questions that we have go along with that really nicely.\n",
      "We were just wondering if you could talk us through, from your experience, the typical process that occurs in order to get patients into your office for treatment or for study participation.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "How long in terms of time do you feel like it's been going on?\n",
      "When you think back over the past months and years, when do you think it first started to get to a point where it moved beyond just being present, to being a problem?\n",
      "You think it's been years, do you think it's been more recent than that?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I think, oh, it's definitely been years.\n",
      "Definitely been years.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "Probably back in the '80s, it started getting worse.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Were you always living in the same home that you have now?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "No. I was a single mom, raising a son.\n",
      "I, let's see, started out in a apartment.\n",
      "I had a home when I lived in Gainesville.\n",
      "Didn't do clutter then.\n",
      "Yeah, I lived in an apartment, and it started getting ...\n",
      "But it was a townhouse.\n",
      "I could confine the mess to the upstairs, and that was great, and keep the downstairs in good shape.\n",
      "I guess just as time went on, it just started getting worse and worse.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Was it related to your children or your child leaving home?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There were difficulties with my son.\n",
      "Then, let's see, he was starting to get into trouble.\n",
      "Went to live with his father, and that was pretty stormy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:18:04]\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "For him.\n",
      "Working us both against each other, and that sort of thing.\n",
      "Just a really toxic situation all the way around.\n",
      "I know that made my depression and some anxiety, et cetera, et cetera.\n",
      "I think the clutter got worse then.\n",
      "Kind of feeling-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's gotten-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "... I failed at this, dadadadada.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's gotten worse when there've been more stressful or just more difficult periods in your life, it sounds like.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How it's been impacted by moving or changing homes?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I purchased my house, gosh, the house I'm living in in '05.\n",
      "I still have a garage full of boxes that I haven't unpacked.\n",
      "Then, after my mother passed away, we had several stages of breaking down households, and I still have a few boxes of my parents' stuff that I need to deal with.\n",
      "It's just all added to it.\n",
      "Just, I feel more overwhelmed than ever.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "It sounds like in addition to the stressful periods in your own life, every time you've had to deal with packing stuff up, or having stuff arrive, from inheriting it, it's just been added and you haven't been able to have the chance to go through it.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I've got the chance.\n",
      "I'm totally retired.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's maybe not a question of time.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's the willingness to go through it and deal with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Do you feel like your behavior is a problem for you right now?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: That is really interesting.\n",
      "It’s interesting partially because in a lot of our past interviews, people have kind of written that off or said that this is not at all related to hoarding.\n",
      "So it’s interesting, and I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you see that in your patients or how, if you have examples of the way that people experience this differently.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "I think when you ask people especially about what, in what environment do they feel comfortable, you get a variety of responses.\n",
      "Now many people with hoarding disorder will say they’re uncomfortable at home with the clutter but, yet, many people will say I just feel comfortable around my stuff.\n",
      "And I had one client at one point tell me, uh, I came to her house and she said “I had such a tough week and I just want to come home and gather my treasures around me,” and so this sense of comfort and safety being surrounded by one’s possessions, I think, reflects a little bit of this tendency, potentially, this tendency to want to feel cave-like.\n",
      "You see this in animals.\n",
      "Some animals are cave-like – a dog, for instance, like to be in a kennel because they feel safe there.\n",
      "You see this also sometimes in autism where there’s sort of these comfort devices where people get in, they’re sort of clamped into these devices.\n",
      "Something similar to that I think may go on in hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Again, now, that’s speculative, and what I would be interested in is somebody actually doing that research.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Mmhmm.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: The last question that we wanted to ask related to the DSM 5 criteria was so the line goes “this difficulty is due to a perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them.”\n",
      "Well how do you determine how much distress is normal or abnormal and how does that relate to potential insight issues when a patient denies having a problem and making that determination of distress?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "The distress I think is related not so much to the distress someone would say when they have this disorder, but the distress if they are faced with the prospect of getting rid of something.\n",
      "So that even though someone with respect to insight, someone may say “I don’t have a problem and I’m not distressed by all this stuff,” but they would experience significant distress if they tried to throw something out.\n",
      "And so that’s the part of this question about insight and someone who denies that they have a problem.\n",
      "Uh, so…remind me again of the first part of that question; I answered the second part.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah.\n",
      "Just making the determination in how much distress is normal or abnormal.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh yeah, okay.\n",
      "So that’s a clinical judgement, I think.\n",
      "But it’s a judgement that’s hard to make without discussing with the person or maybe doing experiments trying to see how difficult it is to throw something away.\n",
      "And so, again, it comes down to clinical judgement about how, um, how much distress warrants a diagnosis.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "That's the blessing, because in 2016, the IT consulting industry was really changing.\n",
      "Our company downsized, and I got laid off, was the deal.\n",
      "After that for about a year, for a few months, basically, when I finished my last assignment, I was back on the bench, and then, the company said okay, everybody on the bench, we're not going to pay you full salary anymore, which is what we'd had for years.\n",
      "They said, we're going to pay you 20% of your salary.\n",
      "That was a huge hunk down.\n",
      "I already had a little pension from taking early retirement from another job, and that helped.\n",
      "Then, I would pick up gigs here and there, but then in February, it was, we're still not getting clients, we still don't have anything, going to have to let you go.\n",
      "I thought, my plan here is, let's do all those things that I couldn't do when I was out of town working.\n",
      "Started out with a physical, and they found calcifications on the mammo, and went back, had a core biopsy, and got it treated, taken care of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm so glad that that-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Feeling good about that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... timing worked out.\n",
      "Was that this past year, or was that-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah, it's kind of like, whoa, have the fates intervened here?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, the timing was really-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Because I had absolutely no symptoms, no nothing, just these little-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Amazing.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "... micro-calculi in the ducts.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You couldn't even feel them.\n",
      "It sounds to me, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm saying this back to you to check, it sounds like with your stuff and your clutter, and being home with it, it sounds like you've more avoided the spaces that are cluttered, and stayed in the front of the house where it's less cluttered, and just shoved the clutter out of your mind.\n",
      "Is that true, or do you feel like you spend a lot of time in the spaces that are cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "No, I spend a lot of time in the back of the house.\n",
      "The house has a living room up in front, and then a big family room.\n",
      "Big open space, kitchen, breakfast, family room in the back of the house.\n",
      "I'm right in the middle of the clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Tell me about your space.\n",
      "Tell me about the cluttered space.\n",
      "Which rooms does it take up, and what is it like in those rooms?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Only a little bit because actually this house I bought is a lot bigger than what I've had before so I do have a lot more space.\n",
      "And I have some rooms that I don't even have anything in and I love that.\n",
      "So, I haven't decided what I'm going to use those rooms for.\n",
      "But the thing is I still do...\n",
      "Any of the furniture I have that has a horizontal surface I cover up with clutter including my dining room table.\n",
      "So, I pretty much never eat meals at the table and it would be nice to eat at the table but instead, I have my laptop there.\n",
      "And my ritual is every morning I make my pot of tea and then sit down at the table and check my emails on my laptop.\n",
      "And that's also where my disorganized mail from who knows when might be stacking up around there.\n",
      "And so, anyway.\n",
      "Yeah, so the table is not usable as what it was designed for.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you use it more as an office space rather than a place for dining?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I do, yep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and when you think about your possessions... I know that you've mentioned it makes you feel closer to family like you have family in your home.\n",
      "But what else makes them valuable?\n",
      "How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Well, I guess one is if it makes me feel good.\n",
      "If it makes me smile, makes me happy, makes me feel good then it's for sure valuable.\n",
      "But then there are things I know that don't make me feel good or feel happy that I can't seem to cut loose of.\n",
      "And I guess that's the sentimentality or attachment that is hard for me to deal with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's that sentimentality that we keep going back to that's your main priority?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "For some of it.\n",
      "But I'm sorry, I'm going to go back now to the overall picture.\n",
      "So much of what is cluttering my house is not sentimental, it's utilitarian and it's just... I just need to decide that I'm going to give it away if it's still something useful.\n",
      "I mean....\n",
      "This is kind of an aside now, I don't think I have trouble discarding stuff that's truly junk and not useful and stuff to go to the landfill.\n",
      "That is not so hard for me to do.\n",
      "But if it's something like...\n",
      "Okay, I have way, way, way, way, way more pens and pencils that anybody needs to have.\n",
      "I don't buy them anymore, I haven't for years but I guess I used to buy them and I will collect them.\n",
      "A lot of places give them to you for free and it's like, \"Oh, yeah.\"\n",
      "I'm one of those people, it's hard to say no to anything that's offered freely.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: So, the idea we have right now is to both try to understand the degree to which people with this problem come into the treatment setting with a different conception of what’s wrong with them and how to improve it and their providers as a way of getting at improving treatment and also improving people’s receptivity to treatment.\n",
      "But also, we were kind of interested in the disorder more broadly, and we are a little bit concerned at this point, I think, that we are going to have really, really long interviews.\n",
      "Our interviews with providers are already quite long, but I think that [NAME 40:39]’s experience with patients suggests that we’re going to be talking to people for probably a really, really long time.\n",
      "So, we’re trying to think of how to do a good interview with this population.\n",
      "I don’t know that there is anybody who has more experience with that than you do.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, well I’ll tell you that the interview process is probably going to be very long.\n",
      "When we did our big psychology study we had over 200 people with hoarding disorder, almost 100 people with OCD, and then a number of community controls.\n",
      "And we did an ADIS, an anxiety disorders interview schedule with a lifetime version, and it took about an hour to an hour and a half with people with OCD.\n",
      "It took about 4 hours for people with hoarding, and I think you’ll see that as you go through.\n",
      "Part of it reflects something about the disorder.\n",
      "This tendency to provide details in a circuitous way so that the nature of the thinking, it kind of winds around.\n",
      "It’s a story, it’s like what we talked about earlier, it’s a story with too many details, and there are so many details that they get lost in it so they can’t quite pull together the big picture.\n",
      "Trying to summarize it all is difficult, so a lot of the details are provided.\n",
      "So that’s, I think that’s what you’re going to run into in these interviews is lots and lots of details, but from their perspective, a difficulty pulling those details together to form a conclusion.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So, is that… that’s what we were talking about, value.\n",
      "Valuing everything.\n",
      "Everything is compelling, every detail of the conversation and the story is compelling as well.\n",
      "I hadn’t thought of it that way.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "And not being able to distinguish what’s truly an important detail from what’s an unimportant detail.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah.\n",
      "And really, I don’t know if you remember form our first interview, we had this listing task which is, you know, supposed to generate a nice, neat list and see what is important to people based on what they say first, second, and third.\n",
      "I’m really interested to see how people with this disorder do with that task.\n",
      "I don’t know if it’s going to even happen, but it’ll be interesting to see how it varies.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "So it's not like, not important like on the hoarding shows, but important to me because I like this room to be the same, and I'd like to have this nice space for my computer and my files.\n",
      "I do have a filing cabinet, and then it's a large room.\n",
      "I'd like the other side of the room to look more like an art studio, so that I would feel happier about coming out here and painting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change the behavior of collecting these items?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I haven't collected anything in years and years.\n",
      "When people have asked, I have friends, one collects strawberries, little things.\n",
      "And one collects mushrooms, and somebody collects something else.\n",
      "I've never collected anything and when people ask me, because they want to give you a gift, I tell everyone I don't want any gifts, I rarely shop.\n",
      "I don't by things, it's just that I have all this stuff already.\n",
      "The only things I have bought are some organizing things.\n",
      "I have plenty of clothes for the kind of life that I have.\n",
      "So I don't collect anything, it's getting rid of the stuff that I've got that's the problem.\n",
      "The only thing really that I do buy is art supplies, I guess.\n",
      "Art supplies, food, makeup, but I don't have a hoard of makeup either.\n",
      "So what I have, I don't want to let go of.\n",
      "So when I was cleaning out one of the drawers, I did get rid of some older makeup, I thought, \"Okay, they say you're not supposed to have this for a long time.\n",
      "So just get rid of this.\"\n",
      "So I avoid shopping, like when friends ask me to go shopping, I don't go.\n",
      "I don't really want to buy stuff.\n",
      "I only do it if I feel like going along for the fun of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you mentioned that the accumulation of items is the problem.\n",
      "Have you ever seen a professional for help with that?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well I have the therapist that I mentioned earlier, and it has come up and he gave me that thing that's what reminded me that anxiety was an issue.\n",
      "He gave me the thing about ...\n",
      "Because I was saying, \"Why aren't I dealing with this?\n",
      "How can I get motivated?\" I've asked those kinds of questions, so yes, as part of my therapy, I have absolutely told him that, about this room and about how I put off paperwork.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Then I'll probably ask you some follow-up questions about each little vignette as well.\n",
      "The first one is that John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no closets in other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized, but is usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "So the options are if I think he has hoarder problems or hoarding disorder or is fine or is normal?\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:41:08].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, basically hoarding disorder, clutter problems.\n",
      "I guess we can use normal or none of the above or something completely different if you feel like he has something completely different.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Honestly, I consider that perfectly normal.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Perfectly normal?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that his behavior is similar or different to your clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I would say it's different because he actually sounds very organized.\n",
      "I think any normal person might [inaudible 00:41:56] some items occasionally.\n",
      "I can understand keeping...\n",
      "You only said several boxes.\n",
      "I can understand the keeping of several boxes.\n",
      "That sounds like he actually uses the boxes that he keeps.\n",
      "I can understand keeping the package that something came in.\n",
      "I happen to work for... I work in radiation oncology, so we're associated with physics.\n",
      "Physics have dozens of little tools that have to be sent out for calibration every once in a while.\n",
      "It's particularly important that you keep all the boxes for each little tool so it can be [inaudible 00:42:35] appropriately placed thing and sent back.\n",
      "Actually, my dad, who is not a hoarder at all and not cluttered at all, he even kept the boxes that things came in in case he wanted to send them back, which he did frequently because he was often dissatisfied with something in one way or another.\n",
      "He would take full advantage of being able to return it.\n",
      "He would make sure that he opened it very carefully, so that the box would be returnable and he made sure that he would keep the box in a safe place so that he could repackage the thing up and put it back when he decided he didn't want it.\n",
      "That's why I kind of feel like that guy is actually not really having a problem with... I mean maybe he does, but from what I hear, I think that's actually pretty normal stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: The first one we have is “Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value” and we’re curious about you make the determination of value for individuals and their possessions and what makes the value judgement someone with hoarding disorders makes inappropriate?\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok, yeah.\n",
      "I, um, that phrase was inserted for a specific reason, and the reason had to do with the diagnostic criteria for obsessive compulsive personality disorder where the criteria there says that a person is unable, or has difficulty discarding possessions that are worthless or limited value, something like that.\n",
      "And so the stereotype for one that that phrase was designed to get at was that hoarding involves the saving of worthless and worn out things.\n",
      "And it’s clear in hoarding disorder, people with hoarding disorder save everything.\n",
      "Now some of it may appear to other people to be worthless and worn out but that’s not always the case.\n",
      "There are cases of people with hoarding whose homes are filled with brand new things, so it’s clear that it’s not just worthless and worn out things, so that’s the reason that phrase went in there.\n",
      "So to say regardless of their actual value means that they save virtually anything.\n",
      "And that’s the way I interpret the phrase.\n",
      "The evaluation of possessions is an excessive evaluation of all possessions.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "The next one we want to ask you about is…\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Can I just ask a quick follow up?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah.\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Just wondering in terms of evaluation of possessions, whether you think that there’s an important distinction to be made in the way that patients, different patients evaluate possessions.\n",
      "Are we talking about an inability to accurately distinguish monetary value?\n",
      "Are we talking about aesthetic value, so patients who find INAUDIBLE [33:44] so kind of describe patients who find aesthetic value in things that you wouldn’t normally find aesthetic value?\n",
      "Or perhaps emotional value?\n",
      "And how you, how this criteria is meant just in terms of which of those ideas of value is meant by this criteria or all of them?\n",
      "Interviewee: All of them.\n",
      "All of them.\n",
      "I think it’s not more specific than it is because there’s such a wide range, and there’s some people who ascribe more aesthetic kinds of evaluation that are problematic.\n",
      "Other people have more sentimental and so forth.\n",
      "But my experience in hoarding cases is that for the most part, people with hoarding apply all those types of evaluations more excessively than other people do.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So it’s less about looking at the specific object and saying, you know, this is an inappropriate evaluation and it’s more looking at them doing that with all objects?\n",
      "Or with…\n",
      "Interviewee: With all objects.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: …Oh well they say it’s INAUDIBLE [34:55].\n",
      "It’s more saying all these objects that they have they value equally.\n",
      "You know, you can’t value everything as valuable.\n",
      "Interviewee: I’m not quite sure I follow what you said but I… what my experience is that they value all objects and have great difficulty distinguishing the importance of possessions.\n",
      "So everything is compelling, which is a quote from one of my early clients.\n",
      "Everything is compelling, so everything gets assigned kind of an equal level of importance and it’s all necessary to save.\n",
      "And so, yeah.\n",
      "So, a lot of... I think that's probably a lot of what my clutter is.\n",
      "But I don't need all that and now I'm in this position again just by moving and have just moved and haven't put a lot of things into the desk in the room that's supposed to be the office room instead of my dining room table but who knows if it ever will be.\n",
      "But yeah, it's my opportunity to pare down and make a decision.\n",
      "I don't need all those pens and pencils, just pick out a few and give the rest away.\n",
      "So, that's a long and convoluted answer I think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay, so it sounds like you're kind of having a combination of both nostalgia and sentimentality clashing with your more utilitarian clutter.\n",
      "But if it came down to it, which do you think you would prioritize more?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "The sentimentality stuff I would prioritize for sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, gotcha.\n",
      "And you actually started talking about this before, you said you have no problem getting rid of things that belong in the landfill.\n",
      "So, what is trash for you?\n",
      "What do you discard?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Well, I discard... I don't discard a lot.\n",
      "In fact, where I live I'm not required to have trash picked up every week.\n",
      "I have a system where I call it.\n",
      "So, when I get my garbage cans filled up, I can them and the next time that they come through the neighborhood they'll pick mine up.\n",
      "And that's because I just... I recycle really fanatically and reuse and of course, keep things that probably I shouldn't.\n",
      "I mean did I need them all along?\n",
      "But when an object is broken beyond repair and the material it's made of are not recyclable or reusable, I will throw it away and it goes to the landfill.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so just when it loses its utility you know it's time for it to go.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, when I figure that neither I nor anybody else in the world could use it.\n",
      "So, I don't get my trash picked up very often.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and I know you mentioned that the most precious item in your house for you is those old books from family members, some you haven't even met, and it's valuable to you because of the sentimentality and the attachment.\n",
      "So, what would happen if you lost those?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I would go with the flow.\n",
      "I mean what can I say?\n",
      "Let's say a fire comes through...\n",
      "We have wildfires around here a lot and they're burning right now.\n",
      "In fact, my view... I have a great view of the Cascade Mountains that I can't see because of all the smoke from wildfires that are happening right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's crazy, mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. It does sound like with COVID, you've become harder on yourself, because you recognize that you've been at home, and this extra time in your life, it has caused you to feel badly about why this isn't being put towards organizing.\n",
      "Does that sound accurate?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "It's accurate, but I wouldn't put everything on that, because it's just, that's just another way to make myself feel guilty, and feel bad about myself for not handling it.\n",
      "The COVID's just another-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "COVID's another-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "... reason to feel bad about myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "For the end of the interview, I have a couple questions for you about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "I kind of want to preface that by saying, everybody we interview is on a spectrum of behaviors.\n",
      "I'm asking about your ideas of this disorder.\n",
      "It's up to you, I'm not at all diagnosing you with this disorder, I'm just asking you questions about your knowledge of it.\n",
      "When you think about hoarding disorder, what do you know about it?\n",
      "Where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Mostly just watching TV.\n",
      "That hoarding show.\n",
      "Though in some perverse way, I felt comforted by, I'm not really a hoarder, or I'm on the low end of it, because I don't have little narrow pathways to get ...\n",
      "You know what I'm saying.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm not as bad as the people.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I'm not nearly as bad as those people are, and that even though I've got clutter and mess all around, it's not intervention time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You've mostly seen it on that show, and have seen it as a thing that's the most extreme example of this kind of behavior.\n",
      "It's almost-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... been good to see that other people are so much more extreme than what you've been experiencing.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "That, and then there was a very wealthy family in Houston, and I think it was a mother and son, lived in this wonderful mansion in River Oak, where the homes start at a couple of million.\n",
      "Their house caught fire, and the firemen couldn't get in the front door to do anything, to get them rescued, and they both died-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh my goodness.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "... of it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I thought, nope, not there.\n",
      "I'm okay, it's all good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I can still get out of my house in a fire.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's incredible.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You never really think about happening in places like that, in a huge mansion like that.\n",
      "You got to wonder what that was like.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I guess that begs the next question I was going to ask you, which is, in your mind, what is the difference between something like hoarding disorder, or even a lesser version of it, having a problem with clutter, and having a collection or being a collector?\n",
      "Often, when I interview people, they have collections of things, or they have things that they do collect.\n",
      "How do you make that distinction?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it ever impacted friendships or romantic relationships?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I haven't had a romantic relationship in so long.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "This all happened after that?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That doesn't really apply.\n",
      "It affects friendships in that, I'm not comfortable inviting people to come to the house.\n",
      "I'm missing out on that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it ever impacted your work?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "When I couldn't find things.\n",
      "Yes, it did.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever tried to get help with this behavior?\n",
      "Either from somebody to help you organize, or going to see a counselor or a psychologist about it?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "No. I saw a psychologist, gosh, in, let's see, it was in the late '90s, saw a psychologist, and everything seemed to be related back to the depression.\n",
      "I felt like I had, and depression's, that's my family illness.\n",
      "I can look at it from the both maternal and fraternal sides of the family, going back to my grandparents.\n",
      "Of course, I felt like I have worked through all of the growing up things, and resentment and anger, and I'm at peace with a lot of that.\n",
      "I'm going, let's think about this as a chemical imbalance, and find the magic pill that will help me manage it.\n",
      "I've been on different antidepressants for years now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like any of that has been helpful for you?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "At least once a year, I'll go, I don't think any of this is doing any good, and I will do a period of abstinence from it, to see, does it get worse, or what.\n",
      "Yes, it does seem to get worse, that I would, not only would I still be sitting still, but I'd be crying a lot.\n",
      "It's never gotten to ...\n",
      "I've never made a suicide gesture.\n",
      "I would have periods of time where I thought about it, and that's why I started on meds, but anyway.\n",
      "I thought, yep, it's kind of like, I needed to quit taking it to see what would life be like without it, and to see is it helping at all.\n",
      "Anyway.\n",
      "It hasn't cured my cluttering thing, my need to put myself about ...\n",
      "You keep your house so messy, that's why you can't have friends over.\n",
      "It's your own fault, this is controllable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it sounds like-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "It keeps my emotions more on an even keel.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you saw help for the problems with depression, you feel like you've worked out a lot of the issues you needed to work out, but there's also a biochemical component.\n",
      "While that's helped by antidepressants, it's not solved by antidepressants, and it doesn't seem to be solving at all the cluttering aspect.\n",
      "That sounds like-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Again, I'm just saying this back to you to check in with you, so feel free to contradict me if you feel like this is incorrect-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "No, you've got it.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah, I think induces a certain amount of stress.\n",
      "It's something that, it just seems like if I did straighten everything up, I have a feeling, it wouldn't be long before it was back to what it was before.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Now I'm going to ask a little bit about what you think are the most important differences between what someone might consider normal saving behavior, such as like a collector collecting certain items, and what is considered full blow hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I think that what most people would think of as a collector would be like a certain type of thing, and they're probably neatly displayed or cataloged, and in boxes maybe.\n",
      "I think full blown hoarding disorder means that you can't throw anything out, even food wrappers and having a lot of animals in the house, and not being able to clean up after them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you kind of associated a level of, or rather a lack of cleanliness with full blown hoarding disorder then?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:28:39] ...necessarily... I guess you could have a serious hoarding disorder, but not go to that... I think that would be the extreme.\n",
      "Like those would be the absolute extremes, and then in between, you've got a lot.\n",
      "I think I'd probably fall, I guess I think of hoarding as keeping things that have absolutely no use and that you couldn't explain why it's hard to get rid of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How does hoarding disorder then similar or different from your own behavior?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I think... I guess maybe it wouldn't be a disorder when it gets to the point where it interferes with your ability to function and live a life that doesn't have a lot of anxiety or stress.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When it becomes extremely distressing to the person with the problem?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah, sometimes I think maybe it's more distressing to the other people than to the person doing the hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So you think maybe somebody with a full blown hoarding disorder, would have more of those conflicts that I was asking you about earlier?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think [inaudible 00:30:57] ... probably other mental health issues involved.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What kinds of mental health issues would you assume that somebody with a full blown disorder might also have?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Like anxiety, and fear of losing things, fear of loss.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That kind of leads me to my next question then which is do you think there's a way to tell if somebody has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Might they display some sort of attributes or certain tendencies that might be a tell for you?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "I don't think you could... I don't think it's something that you could really tell just by seeing someone outside their own house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever known someone who maybe you suspected had some issues with clutter?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like some of what you'd like to change is related to just the usability of your space.\n",
      "You'd like to be able to cook more in your kitchen, or sit on the chairs.\n",
      "Some of it is more aesthetic.\n",
      "It sounds like-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... in terms of the aesthetics, it's not important to you that everything be gone, or that everything be perfectly organized, but just that it's more welcoming.\n",
      "I guess, what do you mean by welcoming?\n",
      "What would that look like?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Welcoming is, you'd feel comfortable coming in and sitting down, come in and sit and visit for a while, that anyone who comes over feels good, like I don't have to worry about breaking something, or making a mess, et cetera, et cetera, that it's comfortable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like some of the things that you own are important for you to feel at home in your home?\n",
      "Which things are those?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Things that I own that're important for me to feel comfortable?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, in your own home.\n",
      "Things that you feel are homey in your house.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Like a comfy chair?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I have these two rescue dogs, it's a mother and daughter, and I got rid of a chair that was really worn out, it was a recliner.\n",
      "It had wooden sides, so the dogs really couldn't snuggle up.\n",
      "I thought, okay, this chair's going out.\n",
      "I'll put it out the day before heavy trash day, and maybe somebody else can take it and recycle it, and sure enough, one of the neighbors picked it up.\n",
      "I bought an oversized chair with giant arms and a huge footrest, so both dogs can sit with me now.\n",
      "That's my favorite thing in the house right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your chair-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Sounds crazy, but-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, your chair is your favorite spot, because you can be at home and with your dogs, and you can all be together and comfortable together in that space.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I can pop the laptop over.\n",
      "Right now, I've got a beading project set up on the loom, on an over-bed table that I can put in my lap and work, finish it, finish that up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All of the things that you might want to do are in reach?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:43:44].\n",
      "It's like, this is the center of my daily life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "When you think about your items in your home, or the things that are cluttering your home, do you feel that they're valuable?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Not particularly.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why do you say that?\n",
      "Ultimately, it's deciding how to get this over with, get on a different direction of...\n",
      "It's like, he's dead set now on living in the street, having nothing, starving to death, suicide, whatever.\n",
      "This kind of talk is-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's overwhelming to be around.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "So very stressful to live with it.\n",
      "And I've just been searching for the resolution for, but our lease ends in October, so that gives me the opportunity to break off in my own direction.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And it sounds like that'll be a welcome change for you.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes, indeed.\n",
      "And it's not my responsibility if he's not preparing himself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, not at all.\n",
      "It's nice to hear that you're aware that it's not your responsibility, and while you sympathize with him, you recognize that you must do what's good for you and not...\n",
      "Seems to be working towards moving out.\n",
      "And not only will it get you out of that situation, but it'll help with cutting down on items too.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And it's, yeah [inaudible 00:56:09], but actually, I think pulling boxes out and starting to pull books to donate and getting them out of here might be a good motivator for him.\n",
      "He realizes that I'm serious about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It could be, you never know.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "And get out of here, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So for the questions that I have related to the interview, that brings me to the end.\n",
      "Did you have anything else you wanted to discuss?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "No, no. It was a very interesting chat and actually valuable for me in processing some thinking.\n",
      "So thank you very much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "I loved talking to you and getting to hear about what you've worked on as well as what you value.\n",

      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewee: Because, you know, everything is reductionistic.\n",
      "You can say that anything you do is biological.\n",
      "It’s got an associated activity in the brain that directs it, and so does that make it biological?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "I think that’s a good question, and that kind of ties into something else that we wanted to ask you about.\n",
      "The explanation that individuals with hoarding disorder have, those reasons that justify their behaviors, do you feel that those explanations are just post hoc reasons to justify a pathological need?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah possibly, possibly.\n",
      "And, you know, thinking about a lot of this, you know, these post hoc explanations, I mean they could fit for any of it.\n",
      "You know, we have this model where we talk about the nature of the attachments to possessions as being something that drives the disorder, but maybe they are post hoc explanations.\n",
      "So, someone has the disorder, they engage in this behavior they have to look for an explanation for the behavior.\n",
      "Maybe the behavior comes first and they create this explanation about being attached to the object.\n",
      "So, if I want to keep this object I must be attached to it, it must have some significance.\n",
      "And then they go through mental gyrations trying to figure out what the significance is and latch on to the, you know, sentiment, emotional attachment, responsibility, and so forth.\n",
      "So, you know, I think the post hoc explanations do weigh in to a lot of these things.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So, you would say that you feel that for a good portion of individuals there may be some kind of need that’s being explained by psychological things or personality or whatever?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think so, I mean I think… I think that it’s hard for people who are engaging in a behavior that they feel some degree of shame about not to make attributions about one’s character, and it’s especially hard for family members of people with hoarding disorder not to make attributions about their character.\n",
      "And so, I think that plays into the disorder and how much shame and how much depression is generated by it.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Interesting, ok.\n",
      "Ok, another, kind of tie in to that is do you think that… or how much do you think that cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions, how much do you think that that plays a role in the development of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a good question.\n",
      "I think it does but only a small amount.\n",
      "We’ve done a little bit of research, we have and published it, looking at materialism and hoarding, and they were correlated, measures of materialism were correlated with hoarding, but the correlations weren’t substantial.\n",
      "They were significant, but they weren’t substantial.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And what do you think the relationship is between hoarding disorder and compulsive or addictive shopping, or a disorder where it focuses more on acquisition or acquisitions of specific items?\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh, I think they’re closely related.\n",
      "I think acquisition, excessive acquisition is a nearly universal aspect of hoarding.\n",
      "From the data that we have, 90 to 95% of people with hoarding disorder acquire excessively or have trouble controlling their acquisitions.\n",
      "And so, you talked about compulsive shopping or compulsive acquiring, there may be folks who compulsively acquire who don’t hoard, and there are a few people who have hoarding disorder but don’t acquire excessively, although relatively few, I think.\n",
      "I think there’s a substantial overlap there.\n",

      "Or not seeing that-- Thinking that you’re calling- saying they have a problem that looks like the very worst of what hoarding can look like, that can cause issues.\n",
      "Then if they are not able to kind of see that their problem doesn’t have to look exactly like everyone else’s problems- that they may be more resistant, I guess, into those concerns.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. For the next section, we want to talk about some of the explanations that patients with hoarding disorder might have for their behaviors.\n",
      "So we want you to think through a couple of the questions that we have from the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale, and in your experience, think about how your patients might respond to these questions.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, the first one that we have is What do you think has caused you to have these behaviors?\n",
      "Do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, and just like, freely what their answer would be, or do you have the answers?\n",
      "Interviewer: No.\n",
      "What you think and- yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm I think that some people would definitely recognize that it’s a little bit of a biological trait, in that their family members have had issues, even if they-- I think they recognize that it’s not necessarily just that they had-- They were in their surroundings growing up, but that they, and like, they have learned it from them, but also that some of its inherited.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. So if they’ve been in their environment, they’re more likely to understand that its biological, but if not they may not make that connection?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, if they don’t have any family members, uhm then the genetics-- The biological component may be harder for them to really have that insight over.\n",
      "They may recognize that, at least that they struggle emotionally with feeling negative emotions, and that may be a reason why they have the problem like in that-- That that being more like a general problem than necessarily a hoarding-specific one, with the difficulty with negative emotions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok so if it wasn’t a biological cause, they might have more of a psychological reason and understanding of their problem.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Uh the next question that we wanted to ask you how patients might respond is How convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, I don’t feel like there’s been a lot of people who have really felt like something horrible would happen besides-- I would say the horrible thing would be that they would feel unhappy, that they would feel uncomfortable.\n",
      "Uhm more so than some other catastrophic outcome would come up from it.\n",
      "Interview 004\n",
      "(part 1)\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Um, I’m doing good.\n",
      "I’m on the line with my colleague, NAME [4:54].\n",
      "Interviewee: Hi NAME [4:55].\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Hi.\n",
      "Nice to meet you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Nice to meet you.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Um, well first of all we just wanted to say thank you so much to agreeing to meet and interview with us.\n",
      "We’re really excited about this interview.\n",
      "We both read a lot of your work on hoarding disorder, so we’re really excited to talk to you today.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, it’s my pleasure.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: We also, of course, wanted to thank you for sending out the email to the special interest group.\n",
      "We set up several interviews through that and have conducted about five or six now.\n",
      "We have a few more scheduled for later on.\n",
      "We’re still continuing to receive replies, so thank you again for that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Good.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Just to kind of start things off, we have an informed consent that we’d like to read to you over the phone just to let you know a little but about the study, but really it was all in the email.\n",
      "We’re trying to understand how patients and clinicians understand hoarding disorder and how that understanding might differ between clinicians and patients, and we eventually want to compare these interviews to patient interviews in order to see what differences and similarities might exist.\n",
      "So there are of course no direct benefits to you for participating.\n",
      "The biggest risk to you would be a violation of confidentiality.\n",
      "You may withdraw and discontinue participation at any time, and if you decline to participate, no one will be told.\n",
      "If you feel uncomfortable in any way during the interview session, you have the right to decline to answer any questions or to end the interview if you so choose.\n",
      "The interview will take about sixty minutes.\n",
      "Some notes will be taken during the interview and an audio recording of the interview will be taken and transcribed.\n",
      "If you don’t want to be recorded, you won’t be able to participate in the study.\n",
      "Any information that could identify you will be removed from the transcription and the audio recording will be destroyed afterwards.\n",
      "We will not identify you by name in any reports.\n",
      "All of these precautions are in order to prevent your individual comments from having any negative repercussions.\n",
      "Do you have any questions about any of that?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, that sounds good.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Well thank you so much.\n",
      "These are some great listings generated for us.\n",
      "Kind of moving into the more free-form section of the interview.\n",
      "We just kind of wanted to start out wondering if you could give us your background relating to hoarding disorder to kind of start off.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "I started studying hoarding disorder in about 1990, and at the time there was nothing out there in the literature on hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So, the first project involved a newspaper advertisement that we put in the paper asking for people who describe themselves as packrats or chronic savers.\n",
      "We had hundreds of responses and so the first study we did was in fact the first published scientific paper on hoarding was 1993, which was a review of that study or several studies relating to that using that population of a hundred people.\n",
      "And since then, I’ve published I don’t know how many papers, 60 or 70 papers probably on hoarding of various kinds including a number of papers on phenomenology, some theoretical papers on theology, and a number of papers on treatment or interventions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, we’ve talked a little bit about the process by which patients get to your office already and you know, you’ve mentioned that there are sometimes self-motivations for bringing people to your office and that there might be family members involved sometimes.\n",
      "When you do see family, friends, or a social network playing a role in helping patients to come to see you or to come to see a clinician, which relatives or members of the social network are normally involved in those cases?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say the most common at this stage of the game are adult children and second are spouses.\n",
      "Interviewer: Uh-huh.\n",
      "And do you often see involvement of like state employees, such as social workers or police officers or landlords for being a motivator for bringing people in.\n",
      "Interviewee: Only if there’s a threat.\n",
      "Interviewer: Is that relatively rare?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, no, well again, it depends on the source of the clientele.\n",
      "So if I go over to NAME [58:58] and ask him about his clients in the housing authority office, he’s going to have a different experience than we do in the mental health clinic.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense.\n",
      "And I know that we’ve reached the end of time that we got today, so I just want to close with one final question.\n",
      "I would like to ask, you know, who you think are the important people that we talked to for part of this project clinically.\n",
      "But the closing question is in your opinion, and we’ve touched on this a little bit, what do you think are the biggest unknowns in the world of hoarding disorder right now?\n",
      "What are the biggest questions that we still don’t have answered?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, those are the ones that I mentioned at the very beginning.\n",
      "To what extent is hoarding driven by very basic brain stem and/or cognitive elements?\n",
      "And the rest of what we try to understand about it is that they just, uh, whoops, why am I getting the beep?\n",
      "Ok, never mind.\n",
      "The, uh, so we just have to understand that better in order to get it.\n",
      "That’s going to put us on a much more biological level on this.\n",
      "I think we also don’t have the geneticist that are telling us that there’s something going on there.\n",
      "But I don’t think we have a clue what it is that is inherited and where it lies and so there’s a lot more we don’t get about that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So those seem to be the biggest questions that’s kind of, uh…\n",
      "Interviewee: There’s, there’s one other question and that is that while this problem is age old, so we know it is not due nearly to our current cultural context and we know it crosses cultures.\n",
      "Although right now most of those cultures are western.\n",
      "They have enough affluence within the culture to put people in and send money and buy stuff.\n",
      "We have massive efforts to sell us things these days and to make us think that our value depends on what we own, and that’s a cultural problem.\n",
      "And I do not know the extent to which if you were will be able to remove that.\n",
      "People would not have the same degree of hoarding that we see now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So I have a few questions about your overall general functioning.\n",
      "Have you felt any change in your physical health, since the beginning of quarantine for you?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Physical health versus mental health?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm going to ask eventually about both of them.\n",
      "So how are you doing in both realms?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well physically, I'm actually doing better.\n",
      "Because I did decide at the beginning that I was going to have to take a walk every day.\n",
      "Otherwise, I knew I would sink into a depression if I didn't do that.\n",
      "Because I am prone to depression, I forgot, my doctor described it as dysthymia.\n",
      "Are you familiar with that?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "So he has diagnosed me with dysthymia, and I thought, \"You know, I'm not around people.\"\n",
      "I need a certain amount of time alone, but I also need time around people.\n",
      "And, I thought, I'd have to get outside and be more physical.\n",
      "So I walk my dog, then I put her in a baby carriage, and I take a brisk walk with her almost every day, five to six days a week.\n",
      "Sometimes I give myself one day off.\n",
      "So physically, I think that has helped me.\n",
      "Oh, and not at the same time, I had already made the decision.\n",
      "But about two weeks later, I saw the Heartline study.\n",
      "Are you familiar with that?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. Participant 29:\n",
      "The Heartline study is a study that Johnson & Johnson and Apple are doing cooperatively.\n",
      "And, they're doing this study for three years to look at arrhythmia.\n",
      "So as part of the study, I could get a greatly discounted Apple Watch.\n",
      "And so I have to wear my Apple watch all the time, except while I'm sleeping.\n",
      "So it measures it.\n",
      "So, that's also given me some reason to continue.\n",
      "It's getting hard to go out for my daily walk, but I thought it can't be a decision.\n",
      "It just has to be something I do.\n",
      "So physically I'm probably stronger, and I'm being measured by Johnson & Johnson.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's really cool that they're offering that, and it's helping you stay on track too with the goal you already had.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It makes me very aware of how much I'm doing.\n",
      "It measures your daily movement, it tells you to stand every hour if you haven't stood in that hour.\n",
      "You have to stand and walk around for a minute.\n",
      "And it tracks my outdoor workout.\n",
      "I started lifting weights at the same time, since this started, just hand weights.\n",
      "So I'm trying to take good care of my health more so, than I was before.\n",
      "But I was active before, and so now I'm not as active.\n",
      "So, that's what I'm doing to try to keep my physical health good.\n",
      "And I'm doing it for my mental health.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is it helping with the mental health as well?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I don't know, because mine is so random, and it's ...\n",
      "The clothing thing is the closest thing I can come to a collection.\n",
      "It's more, oh, shiny, that's so pretty, I want it.\n",
      "That'll go so well with such and such, or isn't that scarf beautiful?\n",
      "I don't display it.\n",
      "My only collection, and then I start thinking about, the hoarders collect newspapers, or they collect aluminum foil, or just random things.\n",
      "I'm always curious as to why they do that, and I think, maybe if it's somebody who was really elderly that grew up in the depression, when you saved rubber bands and washed aluminum foil and saved it, and that sort of thing, so you'd never have to worry about running out.\n",
      "Some of the things people collect, it's like, oh, that doesn't even make sense.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "I really appreciate your time today.\n",
      "That's all the questions I had for you.\n",
      "I'm going to get-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "...some demographic information from you, and your address, so that I can send you a gift card to say thank you for your time.\n",
      "Again, it can be either electronic or it can be a physical gift card that we will mail to you.\n",
      "The only caveat I will say is-\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Oh, that reminded me of something else.\n",
      "Sometimes because you're not dealing ...\n",
      "You have too many papers, you might get late charges on a bill that you've overlooked because I'm not organized.\n",
      "And that just annoys me.\n",
      "I can pay it, fortunately I had a good career and I can pay it, but it's annoying.\n",
      "I don't want that to happen.\n",
      "And I'm trying to set a better system just for myself, like I'm using reminders on my phone now, things like that, so that that doesn't happen.\n",
      "But that doesn't come naturally to me, it's not an easy process for me.\n",
      "I rarely just like to get the mail and dump it in a pile.\n",
      "... So I consider that a problem.\n",
      "And I've had my water turned off once, I had no idea why.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like, \"That must've been a paper I missed.\"\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I didn't realize that I hadn't paid my water bill.\n",
      "I'm like, \"What?\" And I pay it in chunks, like $500 at a time.\n",
      "So those envelopes came in and I just don't open them.\n",
      "So I don't know if that's part of hoarding, or if that's something else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's probably all related.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's probably all related.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah, I think it is.\n",
      "So those are ways [inaudible 00:33:46] my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever had family and friends that have approached you about this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "No. Well, except like I told my friends that I had my water bill turned off, and they're like, \"You're not opening your mail again?\" I'll say stuff about myself, so they know that.\n",
      "But it's not like they feel like, they haven't had to do an intervention on me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So they've noticed these small things such as like if you mention that you haven't paid a bill, or if you mention that the mess has annoyed you.\n",
      "They know about it through that?\n",
      "But they don't necessarily feel as big of a problem as you see it?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "No, because I look like I'm all together to the outside world.\n",
      "I make sure I'm properly dressed.\n",
      "I take care of myself in the home that they see.\n",
      "So I don't think they can truly imagine it.\n",
      "If they're talking about something like in that realm, I'll say, \"Oh yeah, I know what you mean.\n",
      "I didn't pay my water bill because I don't open my mail.\"\n",
      "So I do have one friend who asked me occasionally, \"Have you opened your mail recently?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "They're looking out for you.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "They're looking out for you.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "I don't mind that she says that, and I tell her the truth.\n",
      "And sometimes it's yes, and sometimes it's no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without necessarily being in their home or the area that is cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well, like I said about if someone won't let you into their home, is that what you mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like if someone won't let you in, or ...\n",
      "Just what you can observe from the outside, I guess.\n",
      "I mean, I don't think you can tell just looking at an individual, I'd say if you're walking on the street, I don't think I can say, \"Oh, that's a hoarder.\"\n",
      "Unless they're really a shopping [inaudible 00:46:12].\n",
      "So I don't think that I can tell.\n",
      "I don't think they're necessarily sloppy, dirty people.\n",
      "I think somehow, even the ones whose homes are horrific, manage to clean themselves up.\n",
      "So I would say, other than what you can observe from outside, no. And the fact that they don't even invite you over to their house.\n",
      "Or, if you go to the door, and I had this happen to me, like they kind of squeeze through the front door to get outside to talk to you, so that you can't see anything inside.\n",
      "It's like, \"Boy, I wonder if that person has a hoarding disorder?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you wonder that?\n",
      "Did that thought ever come to mind before you were diagnosed?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Oh, I don't know if I was ever diagnosed, I think I'm self-diagnosed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Before you started using the words hoarding disorder, thinking of yourself in that manner.\n",
      "Did you ever think of others in that way?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "... I'm trying to really think if ...\n",
      "Probably not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I'm just thinking I might not have even been very aware of it, until I saw television programs on hoarding.\n",
      "And I probably never gave it any thought before that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the main source of information that you've had on hoarding seems like it's been TV, right?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Anywhere else that you've heard about it?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I've probably read articles on it after that.\n",
      "Like always trying to deal with this little issue of mine, if I might come across an article in a magazine or online, I would read something about it.\n",
      "I read a lot of organizing articles, and there's a overlap there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A little bit, yes.\n",
      "...\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That ends most of the questions that I have regarding hoarding disorders specifically.\n",
      "Do you have any final thought, or any questions that really got you thinking further?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I think that I've been kind of interjecting whenever something comes up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You have, I appreciate that.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "What I will say is, as feedback, I really like your reflections back on things.\n",
      "I think you've done an excellent job interviewing and really synthesizing everything that I was saying.\n",
      "So that made me very comfortable.\n",
      "So I wanted to say that.\n",
      "It made it easy.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right\n",
      "Interviewee: Even if we say things for, you know, because we are attached to it.\n",
      "So, uh, I don’t know what drives that and I think, so that’s one that I find interesting and distinctive about hoarding.\n",
      "Uh, the lack of organizational capacity is pretty universal, but there are a few people who hoard who actually can organize quite well and they can organize other people’s stuff, they can’t do it with their own.\n",
      "And I’m, again we’re thinking that is that emotion in the way, is that why they can’t do it, they can’t use higher cognitive function in order to get things from here.\n",
      "Uh, so those are some of the interesting ones, um, you know there are some side features that are sort of interesting.\n",
      "NAME [22:52] called it cutter blindness where you stop seeing things, but I don’t find that essentially unique because all of us who live in our homes, you know once you stash the boxes and the books in the corner, you kind of forget about them because they’re not in your path.\n",
      "So, the fact that they don’t see the clutter anymore is just I think habituation, um, so I wouldn’t go there with it.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about, do you think that certain kinds of people are more likely to be hoarders?\n",
      "Maybe older or younger people, people of a certain grades, socioeconomic status, or region, or rural or urban.\n",
      "Do you think that…\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t.\n",
      "I don’t.\n",
      "I think we got that part of the problem with the variability, it’s a… Both old and young have it.\n",
      "When it’s in the younger population, it just doesn’t show up in quite the same way because somebody else controls the environment, but, uh, as they get… If they got the tendency, they usually have it from a pretty young age, and it’s a tendency to accumulate things and be unable to let them go for whatever reason.\n",
      "So, that’s consistent.\n",
      "Socioeconomic status is huge in the range.\n",
      "They tend to be poorer, partly because [laugh] they’re so disorganized, that they, they don’t organize their lives in order to make good use of many or working capacity.\n",
      "But no, I don’t see any pattern of that ilk.\n",
      "I think the patterns are probably at the cognitive level of that capacity and possibly emotional.\n",
      "So I have filled those and they're in the garage, whenever I fill a box, I put it in the garage.\n",
      "But I have one in my office, in case I have anymore papers to put in it.\n",
      "So it started really good.\n",
      "I was motivated, I thought I don't have to go to any meetings, I'm not doing this or that.\n",
      "But then, after maybe a month or six weeks, I'm not sure.\n",
      "I've been in the house since March 12th.\n",
      "So, I kind of started the ... the novelty started to wear off.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's a good way to put it.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "And I could only do it for maybe an hour at a time, because then I would get anxiety.\n",
      "So I would do as much as I can do, and then I'd think, \"Okay, you'll just do some more tomorrow.\"\n",
      "And I really was doing it every day.\n",
      "But now, I'm really having to push myself to do it every day.\n",
      "I'm still very involved with my volunteer work, and this past week has been extremely difficult with too many phone conversations, too many Zoom meetings, a couple of webinars.\n",
      "So I don't beat myself up over when I have that much going on.\n",
      "But there are some other times where I've thought, I really could have spent some time on this.\n",
      "So I'm a mixed bag, but I think it has to do with my anxiety levels.\n",
      "And ...\n",
      "Like I said, the novelty wore off.\n",
      "I got tired of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When did that happen?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I'm saying four to six weeks end.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is a considerable amount of time anyways.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is a considerable amount of time anyways for something to lose it's novelty, as you said.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I did get a fair amount done.\n",
      "I'm really happy about what I got done.\n",
      "But, I described the place in my house as it's like the loaves and the fishes, it doesn't seem to matter how much I get rid of.\n",
      "I look around and it's still very cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That probably leads to overwhelming feelings and contributes to the anxiety too, correct?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Absolutely.s?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, the last part of the DSM five we’d like you to talk through with us is this part where it says: this difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with describing them.\n",
      "And I guess we’d like you to talk through the determinations of distress and what level of distress is normal and abnormal and whether there are sometimes problems in assessing the levels of distress that hoarders have about discarding, particularly in cases where the patient might have very low insight about their own problem.\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, the distress associated with discarding it is usually pretty evident, there, they report it freely.\n",
      "Indicate, again, you know, the kinds of oh I’ll feel guilty, oh I’ll feel sad, oh I’ll feel anxious.\n",
      "Some negative emotion will occur if they try to let go of the object.\n",
      "Some people might appear to be able let go freely, but in the back of their mind, they have a plan for how they’re going to recover it, or buy it again, or whatever it is they might do.\n",
      "One might need to double check if there’s no significant emotion displayed, whether or not they have engaged in it, avoidance behavior in order to get to that point.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhmm.\n",
      "Ok. So, I would like to kind of return to one of the free lists that we made.\n",
      "What we talked about, reasons that people give for their hoarding.\n",
      "Now for you, do you feel like these explanations that people give you for why they save are real reasons or are they kind of justifications for an underlying need?\n",
      "Interviewee: What a good question.\n",
      "That’s a really good question, and I don’t know the answer to it.\n",
      "Um, again, I’m concerned about the variability in the reasons that people give, and when you have that much variability… So for our anxiety disorders in mental health, you know, when somebody’s got panic, you can rely on emotional features that to help you diagnose the panic.\n",
      "You’re going to get a pretty consistent report of not exactly the same symptoms but, you know, within a narrow range.\n",
      "And for hoarding, there’s just all these multiple emotional states that they report or reasons for saving.\n",
      "So it does make me think that sometimes they make it up.\n",
      "That there’s something about the attachment, and I don’t know if it’s visual.\n",
      "For some people, I’ve seen tactile things, you know, stuff that they can touch, that’s either smooth or soft or whatever.\n",
      "They’re attracted to it, that there’s some much more basic level of attraction or need and they make up a reason to explain it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhmm. Ok, well, so I’m going to move into the next section of the interview that kind of – the question I want to ask INAUDIBLE [43:02].\n",
      "So one of the things we’re interested in is the question of insight and how to help patients get insight, what do we mean by insight.\n",
      "And so to kind of follow up on what you just said in terms of patients who may or may not realize the extent to which they are experiencing distress, I just wanted to start the conversation about insight by asking first how you would define insight in this context.\n",
      "Interviewee: My view of insight, I think, is that if we want to say whether or not someone has insight, we should use the more classical definition of insight, anosognosia – the understanding that I have a disorder where something’s wrong.\n",
      "And I think that applies to very few cases of hoarding.\n",
      "And I think the fact it demonstrates that is that there are very, very few people with hoarding disorder who feel comfortable letting someone they don’t know very well into their home because they know how that person is going to react when seeing their home.\n",
      "So they know that something’s wrong, they know there’s something that they are different somehow than other people and that difference will make them viewed in an unfavorable light by other people.\n",
      "And that I think is evidence that there’s some degree of insight on their part.\n",
      "And I think the confusion about insight is people confuse something here and what they confuse is this, that, they’re looking at an individual who has a piece of paper with something scribbled on it that is apparently meaningless and the inability of that person to let go of that piece of paper because it represents something to them.\n",
      "That…many people interpret that as an absence of insight into the importance of that piece of paper when in fact that’s not an insight problem, that’s the disorder itself.\n",
      "That, that attachment to the paper is the disorder, it’s not a problem with insight into the disorder.\n",
      "And I think that’s…\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s a really important distinction.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "And I think that’s in large part in how people get confused when talking about insight because when you’re trying to work with someone and you see them keeping something that they obviously shouldn’t keep or they don’t need to keep, people think the person has no insight but really it’s not an insight problem, that’s the disorder itself.\n",
      "Interviewer: So perhaps there’s a distinction to be made between knowing that the desire to keep the paper is not normal and not something that everybody would feel and knowing that the paper is not valuable?\n",
      "And that clinicians think that because the patient values a piece of paper they don’t have insight…\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: But the patient actually is aware of the fact that that behavior represents itself as that novel behavior.\n",
      "Interviewee: It represents something that…\n",
      "Interviewer: …they do have insight.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "INAUDIBLE [46:35].\n",
      "And the INAUDIBLE [46:35] really has to do with people who don’t believe this is problematic in any way.\n",
      "So that's the kitchen.\n",
      "That's the only other room that I would say has any kind of mess to it.\n",
      "But, my clothes are hung up in the closet, I have hooks on the back of my door for my nightgown and robe, that sort of thing.\n",
      "So those parts of my life are orderly.\n",
      "My bed doesn't have anything else on it, except what belongs on it.\n",
      "Occasionally it'll get a couple of hangers on it, and then I'll notice them and I'll be like, \"I don't want those hangers on there.\"\n",
      "I put them where they belong.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So it is the office and the garage are the two places that you feel are the cluttered portions?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "Yes, just those two places.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you said it's important to you still to be able to walk around these areas, so there's still enough space to move around in them?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I can walk from the door to my chair without any kind of tripping.\n",
      "I kind of make sure because I'll be turning 73 in two weeks.\n",
      "And I don't want to be falling and breaking my hip or anything like that.\n",
      "And I have a little dog too.\n",
      "I have a little dog, so she's sitting here on the floor on her pillow right next to me.\n",
      "I didn't describe her.\n",
      "Sophie, were you feeling left out?\n",
      "... Interviewer:\n",
      "So how severe would you say that your hoarding behavior is now for you and is it a problem?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I still consider it a problem, because everything is not in order.\n",
      "I don't want anyone coming into this room.\n",
      "I don't want anyone seeing it.\n",
      "I'll tell people, but I really don't want anyone to experience it.\n",
      "I mean, I don't go around announcing it, but like I said earlier in the conversation, if it comes up because of something in conversation, I will talk about it.\n",
      "But I really don't want to bring anybody in here.\n",
      "No one has ever been in here.\n",
      "I've lived here 20 years.\n",
      "Of course, it took me a while to make it this messy.\n",
      "So for me, it's not serious like the ones I see on TV, I wouldn't be worth filming for the hoarding show, because of the rest of my house.\n",
      "But for me, I still can't find all my papers when I want to.\n",
      "Still have more stuff than I need to have and it's painful for me to part with the sentimental things.\n",
      "And I have some useless things, that's why I think I am a mini-hoarder, because some of it is unimportant, but I seem to want to keep it anyway.\n",
      "Stupid little stuff, you know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We all have our reasons.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We all have our reasons for keeping things.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you think that cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions play any role in the development of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, I mean, probably to an extent.\n",
      "Probably to an extent that there’s a little bit more of that sense of a need to acquire things.\n",
      "But, I mean, I also feel like this-- Even, I mean, I also feel like a lot of the stuff that people do save or, you know, passively acquire, aren’t necessarily high-price kind of things that are really, I mean-- I think it can, with the variety of things that are out there, say every different possible kind of pen that someone could buy-- With there being a lot of unique kind of things that people could find, that maybe it increases it a little bit; but, at the same time, I think a lot of people with hoarding are more apt to go after some sort of really special thing, which usually means some sort of older thing rather than a newer thing, uhm, like a vintage kind of thing rather than a brand- lots of brand new stuff.\n",
      "So, I don’t know how much it really causes a big issue.\n",
      "But, I mean, I guess certainly, in terms of people’s abilities to acquire new things, with there being stores everywhere and the ability to buy things online and on TV or things like that, certainly can increase.\n",
      "But, not everyone has that issue with actually acquiring new things that they are paying for, you know, they- a lot of people just passively acquire things.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So those that do may experience an increased ability to purchase, but, in terms of the saving, it’s not really the same type of things that are being advertised and associated with value that people with hoarding disorder seem to be collecting.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Uh so now you know, we had mentioned in one of the Free Listing Prompts reasons that people might come in for treatment and you mentioned family distress, and financial issues, and trouble with local authorities, so do you feel like their preventing for treatment is normally self-motivated or by others?\n",
      "Interviewee: A lot of the times its motivated by others.\n",
      "They might get to a point where they recognize that they can’t do it on their own and then ultimately, they have some motivation in it as well.\n",
      "I’ve definitely had a lot of folks who have come in, mostly because their family members have really urged them to do so.\n",
      "They don’t really stay if they are not really willing to do the work.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "So how long has the hoarding behavior typically been going on before you see patients?\n",
      "Interviewee: Usually for at least a couple of decades.\n",
      "Interviewer: Wow.\n",
      "Interviewee: But not necessarily to that extent where its always been that severe, like the actual clutter.\n",
      "The collecting [inaudible 00:53:41], you know, and the-- Some clutter that’s contained by parents and things like that, and some of the behaviors are present when they’re young; but they’re not necessarily so problematic in other people’s eyes that they’re going to be coming in for treatment or going to be bugged about how bad it is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It seems like you've put thought then into how you're going to organize the items and how you're going to determine what you keep and you've started thinking about where you might put these items or where you might donate them.\n",
      "Is this something you were thinking about prior to COVID?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes, it is something I was thinking of prior to COVID, just because I realize that I have more stuff than I want.\n",
      "And some things that I've kept around that are limited utility or things that I use once a year.\n",
      "So I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Being in your own space more and staying in your home didn't push you to start thinking about this?\n",
      "It just gave you more time, it seems to [crosstalk 00:46:36]\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes, I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how have you been doing with your physical health since quarantine started?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I'm not too bad looking.\n",
      "I've been making my regular doctor appointments, taking all my medications that I have for various [inaudible 00:47:00] things as an 75 year old medication for.\n",
      "And then, maintain social distance, wearing masks, all those kind of things.\n",
      "My work for the census, really pressing managers not to assign me field work, as much as possible to give me things like phone calls and cases to follow up with mostly on the phone.\n",
      "I was hired as a supervisor, but they didn't give us people to supervise because the work stretched out over several months, due to the postponements from the initial wave of COVID.\n",
      "So it's been an amazing thing to observe.\n",
      "But once it's done, I have a stack of manuals and handbooks that I can recycle immediately and save a lot of space.\n",
      "And I just have one small computer to turn in.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's not too much.\n",
      "The manuals probably take up much more space than the one small computer.\n",
      "And how have you been feeling and doing mentally since about March?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Well, I have a housemate who we were friends and have some history together, but we've been living together for two years, and he hasn't been doing his part in paying for expenses and rent and so forth.\n",
      "And largely, he has mental health problems and spends much of his time playing video games.\n",
      "And I finally have gotten to the point of saying, after this lease is done, I'm parting ways with you.\n",
      "I'm not supporting you any longer.\n",
      "He's not prepared for that.\n",
      "And he has not had good relations with his children or his ex-wife or any of the friends he's had.\n",
      "And he's having some really serious problems, but I'm not qualified to resolve those problems.\n",
      "And I don't want to keep solving them by paying his expenses.\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so that's-\n",
      "And I've actually cleared out a lot of those when I left that work, but I still have plenty because I enjoy having options for what I want to do, and I also think I might want to volunteer someday to do projects with kids after this whole COVID thing goes away, so I keep things for just in case.\n",
      "Really, I have multiple shelving units in the garage, multiple boxes.\n",
      "Layers upon layers of very interesting, useful things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so you said that you have these boxes, and the items, you might keep them for several years.\n",
      "How do you decide when it's time to discard an item?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Well, when I left a job that I had for 15 years, I very deliberately decided that I needed to discard some of that stuff I'd been hoarding for those 15 years, for projects, and I spent a week on and off going through those particular boxes on those particular shelves, and I donated a whole lot to a local shelter, workshop, thrift store.\n",
      "But there was a lot I could tell I couldn't get rid of, and I had to look at myself like, \"Why not?\n",
      "Are you really going to use this?\n",
      "Yeah, I might, I might.\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "It's in a box, it's not in anybody's way.\n",
      "I have all this space.\n",
      "I'm going to keep that.\"\n",
      "The transition from leaving a job made me get rid of some stuff, but I don't do that very often.\n",
      "I do go to my clothes a few times a year and get rid of stuff to a thrift store.\n",
      "That, I don't have a problem with.\n",
      "But I also, this is sort of going all over the place, but my collection of clothes is always thrift store stuff or yard sale stuff.\n",
      "I don't spend a lot of money in my hoarding, so I take pleasure going to a thrift store and finding a dollar cool pair of jeans or whatever, and I wear them, but it adds up over time, so I get rid of things that I ended up not wearing.\n",
      "I might take three bags of clothes a couple times a year to a thrift store.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, it seems like you're aware of when certain items become a little overwhelming to have, and that you're not using them, but it seems like most of the items that are project-related and linked back to the creativity side of things, those are the things that seem to be harder to justify discarding or getting rid of.\n",
      "Is that correct?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Hmm, well I guess I don't necessarily think of the books being valuable in a monetary sense, they're certainly valuable in a family sense.\n",
      "But I don't think of them as particularly valuable objects.\n",
      "And I do...\n",
      "Okay, there is some similarity in that John Doe in the last one, is that I do enjoy... I do like antiques.\n",
      "I do appreciate them and I do have...\n",
      "Oh, maybe three or four antiques, wooden antique pieces in my own house.\n",
      "In fact, I just bought one a couple of days ago.\n",
      "It's a bookshelf for my family books.\n",
      "But now I might be giving away a lot of my family books, I won't need to use my bookshelf.\n",
      "But anyway, yeah.\n",
      "So yeah, I understand that.\n",
      "But okay, but let me say again.\n",
      "The antiques that I have, I do not consider to be of a particular value.\n",
      "Like again, monetary value.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like monetary, mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "It's not something I think, \"Oh, I'm worried about not having that because it's worth so much money.\"\n",
      "Uh-uh, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, gotcha.\n",
      "So, that's more about the books for you are more of the attachment rather than the financial gain.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and now we're moving onto our very last section, which is about COVID coping.\n",
      "I know that you said that it didn't impact you very much but we'll just go ahead and go through some of these.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, how has COVID-19 impacted your life at all?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Well, it has decreased the amount of social life I have.\n",
      "So yeah, although I do tend to love to stay home and be home by myself most of the time, there were things that I would do that I miss doing that were social that are not happening, they've gone virtual or gone to Zoom or whatever like that.\n",
      "And that is not in any way, as satisfying as being together with a group of people.\n",
      "So, that did impact.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so your socialization behaviors have changed.\n",
      "Has COVID-19 affected your acquiring habits?\n",
      "Have you been buying more, buying less?\n",
      "Saving more, saving less?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Huh...\n",
      "No, I think...\n",
      "Although, I told you I just did buy a bookshelf yesterday.\n",
      "That was more because I needed a bookshelf and it's not an excessive thing.\n",
      "It's an object I can really use.\n",
      "So, I don't think that it has affected my buying and selling.\n",
      "I'm pretty much the same in that regard.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, has it affected your difficulties with throwing things away?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "No. No, it's...\n",
      "Yeah, but no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And has COVID-19 affected your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items?\n",
      "Do you feel more attached or less attached?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Huh... I suppose I could feel just ever so slightly, only very slightly, more attached but really not much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Why would you say more attached?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Totally. If I miss a day, I can even feel a little heavier, if you know what i mean by that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I do.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "They said exercise is important for depression.\n",
      "And it has really shown me during this time, how much it's helping me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know that I lift weights as well.\n",
      "So whenever I do that, or whenever I go on a walk, even if it's a walk to talk on the phone with my parents, or a friend.\n",
      "It does help.\n",
      "It's like the description you used of heaviness is a very good one.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And it sounds like you are pretty comfortable financially before the pandemic.\n",
      "Has COVID-19 affected your financial stability at all?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Not at all.\n",
      "No, I planned very well for my retirement.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You need to let me in on your secrets.\n",
      "It sounds like you're doing great.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well, it's a really simple secret.\n",
      "I started saving when I first went to work.\n",
      "I always just had automatic payments put away, and then I got a good financial advisor who helped me with investing.\n",
      "And, I haven't had the ... I only had that one little period of needing to buy a lot of stuff.\n",
      "But, I buy quality furniture and it lasts a long time.\n",
      "I don't have the need to change it all the time, that sort of thing.\n",
      "So, it's really pretty simple.\n",
      "Always have some money taken out of your paycheck.\n",
      "And whenever I got a raise, I would put a pretty good chunk of the raise into my savings.\n",
      "Because I think I lived without it before, so I don't need to have it now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You are saying the exact same things my parents have said, and somehow whenever, you know how when your parents say it you can brush it off.\n",
      "But whenever you hear it said by others, it clicks a little bit more.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well I hope it clicked for you a little, because it has really helped me have a much more comfortable retirement than some of my friends who had to have new cars and new furniture every couple of years.\n",
      "But it really adds up.\n",
      "And the small amounts add up.\n",
      "Like one of my neighbors is young, and I don't remember what happened, but she lost $10 or something like that, and she was like, \"It was only $10.\"\n",
      "I'm like, \"Well, every $10 adds up. 10 of those is $100\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You can't just let it go.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "So it's the little things.\n",
      "But I will tell you, because you're asking, I never felt deprived of anything.\n",
      "I didn't feel like I was missing out, or I have described myself as frugal, but never cheap.\n",
      "I always bought nice gifts for people, things like that.\n",
      "But, how much do you need after all?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah. So yeah, let's just say, what if a wildfire came through and burned my...\n",
      "Well, burned my house down or burned up my books, I'd be...\n",
      "It would break my hurt, it would really hurt but it would be okay and I think in the big picture of things, in some way, it would almost be a relief.\n",
      "I could lighten my load.\n",
      "I'm always wanting to lighten the load and that would be one way that would.\n",
      "And in fact, you know what?\n",
      "Is it okay for me to go on with ideas that come to me as we're speaking?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, of course.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I mean I think that's what you wanted to hear anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "When I was putting some of the old family books into a bookshelf that I have just a couple of weeks ago, I took the time to open them up and look at the inside pages because some of them or a lot of them have written in them who it was given to when.\n",
      "Like this is from daddy and mummy, Christmas of 1910 or 1881 or something like that.\n",
      "I mean all books...\n",
      "Some of these are really old and I found one that was given to my uncle and I do have a cousin who is the daughter of the only uncle I had.\n",
      "And so, I packaged up that book and mailed it to her.\n",
      "Even though it's part of a collection, the rest of the collection did not have his name in it.\n",
      "It had other people's names and all that.\n",
      "So, anyway, I got a text back from that cousin just today saying, oh, she was so happy to get it and her daughter is really looking forward to it to belong to her and that...\n",
      "The cousin said that she just really did not get very much of the family objects, our family possessions.\n",
      "And so it's...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like heirlooms?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, heirlooms, that kind of thing.\n",
      "And so, I just started thinking this morning, \"You know what?\n",
      "I'm going to talk to my sisters about this.\"\n",
      "Because I have a lot, if not most of all the old family books and stuff.\n",
      "Now mind you, a lot of them or some of them are from my mother's side, not my father and this cousin is from my father's side.\n",
      "And my mother was an only child so there's no cousins or anything from her family.\n",
      "My thought is I want to talk to my sisters about it and ask them if they'd be willing to let us divide up these old books and give some percentage or some amount of them to this cousin, who I think felt neglected or deprived or whatever.\n",
      "So there, so that's something that I'm actually thinking about because...\n",
      "About the objects that are of the most value to me.\n",
      "Interview 006\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, thank you for doing that listening exercise with us.\n",
      "And again just to kind of let you know our methods here.\n",
      "We’re going to take those lists from clinicians and compare them to a list generated by patients in response to some more questions to see where it overlaps, where there are INAUDIBLE [16:03].\n",
      "And now we would like to move into kind of a more freeform, qualitative section of the interview.\n",
      "And just to kind of get us started with the conversation, we would like to here just a little about your background related to hoarding disorder, what your work is like now, I know that we have both read a bunch of it, so we kind of know the answer to this one but just to kind of get us situated here.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok\n",
      "Interviewer: If you could give us a brief overview of your history with patients who have hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "I am a clinical researcher with a social work background.\n",
      "So my degrees are in social work, social work clinical researcher, whatever you want to call it.\n",
      "I got into this work because of my work on obsessive compulsive and INAUDIBLE [16:52] conditions, which hoarding is considered one of INAUDIBLE [16:59].\n",
      "So, in the course of my work on OCD, I encountered some cases of hoarding early in my career.\n",
      "I didn’t think too much about it except that they didn’t behave in the same fashion that my typical OCD patients behaved during treatment, and I remember wondering about it at the time.\n",
      "So, um, can you prompt me what else you need to know?\n",
      "Interviewer: Oh just to kind of, that was it.\n",
      "Um, it’s just, maybe there was a follow up question that would be right now in your research what is the particular INAUDIBLE [17:38] for you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh yeah.\n",
      "I am newly retired from the deanship and soon from the faculty at the university.\n",
      "So, I am not undertaking new research projects on hoarding.\n",
      "The only projects in front of me right now are writing up some research studies that were done and we have not finished the work, the publishing of them.\n",
      "Those are all treatment related studies, not completely, INAUDIBLE [18:15].\n",
      "I also am likely to have a book contract shortly.\n",
      "To write a book for, that is broadly useful by a variety of professional groups as well as patients and their families.\n",
      "I have an [18:37] book in one of their series in which they try to make things as accessible as possible in terms of understanding the problem and treating it.\n",
      "Interviewer: That sounds like a good project.\n",
      "It sounds like there’s still definitely will be an audience for that.\n",
      "Interviewee: But that’s probably more about communicating with the people who need to know than, it is a project, it’s not a study of hoarding per say.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yes, and I have a studio upstairs in my house that is full of both things that I could potentially use to make jewelry out of, but also just cool collectables, but it has gotten to the point where it causes me distress because I would not invite anybody into my studio and a year ago, and before, I would hesitantly allow people in there.\n",
      "Because, okay, originally, I would make a sail out of my home or whatever, but I always felt self-conscious, but it still was like this does express who I am so I shouldn't self-conscious.\n",
      "At this point, where it's at, I feel it expresses the worst of who I am and not the best, so it is causing distress.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so how do you decide what is valuable and what you should be keeping in those spaces?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Well, some decisions are easy, because I really might use them or they really are of value to me either aesthetically, like I like to look at them, but some things just add up.\n",
      "You know, nick-nacky stuff, or just things that don't have sentimental value but are interesting.\n",
      "I still have trouble getting rid of them.\n",
      "I do have a box going of things that aren't as valuable to me, but are still things somebody would like, so I put them in this big box in my studio and I rationalize that if I have not looked in there or wanted that thing for, I haven't picked the amount of months, but some length of time, then I can take that whole box, don't look at it, and just take it to the thrift store and get rid of it.\n",
      "I'll do that, because I'm working on this.\n",
      "But it's going to take a long time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That sounds like ... when did you start doing that, trying that out, where you put items in a box and then if you don't touch the box for a certain amount of time, then taking it to give it away?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "It's probably been just a year but it evolves from something that I've done for a long time, which is trade out items that I've had on display and put them all in a box, and then put up different items that I've been keeping in another box, so that when I notice, if I'm looking around my environment and I realize I haven't actually been looking at these cool things that I set up for myself, if they're invisible to me now, then when I have the feeling like I want to do that, I just take them all off of the mantle, or the desktop, or wherever, the various places, and put them in a box, because they have sentimental value to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, it sounds like a lot of these things are in the basement or maybe on a shelf.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Talking about... I know you mentioned earlier that your husband has basically said that you can't keep everything.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Generally, how do your family and friends feel about your clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I think what it comes down to is my husband.\n",
      "I have two small kids.\n",
      "I don't think they know any different because they've just lived among it so much.\n",
      "We try to get things cleaned up and I try to express the importance to them of organization, but it's very hard to impress them upon them when...\n",
      "And the other thing is we live in a small house, so my two kids share a room.\n",
      "It's hard to find spaces for everything that normal people have spaces for, so it winds up just being cluttered more closely together.\n",
      "I mean it essentially comes down to my husband.\n",
      "Now, another thing, as I mentioned, I've taken a lot of these surveys, and they often ask, \"Are you hesitant to invite people over because of your clutter?\"\n",
      "I have to say, yes, I am, because for starters, we do have this very small house, so you can't really host a party or anything in there, but I have to say that when I have clutter in the living room, then I don't really want to invite people over to witness that squalor that I live in.\n",
      "My friends don't really know or comment, I guess, on my clutter.\n",
      "It's just my husband who's consistently saying, \"Let's try to get things cleared out.\n",
      "We don't need all this stuff.\n",
      "The chances that we're going to use it is small.\n",
      "We should just get rid of it.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so mainly just your husband because, like you said, you don't usually have too many people over partly because it's a small house, but also at times because of clutter, especially if it's in the living room.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "How severe overall would you say your clutter problems are now?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "On a scale of one to 10 or...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I don't have any specific number.\n",
      "If it's easier to do a one to 10 scale, with 10 being very severe and 0 being...\n",
      "P1: Okay so it is something that you think is based on the the values that are culture escribed to different things?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "P3: Okay um, I just want to ask you about another one of um one of the criteria, so this criteria reads ‘the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromise their intended use’ so the question I’d like to ask is how do you judge um clutter and how much stuff counts as clutter?\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm yeah yeah so this is also this is also a tricky one.\n",
      "So I have seen people who have um who don’t have a lot of a lot of clutter, but they still have other emotional attachment that is very typical for people with hoarding problems and um so it seems that clutter seems to me that is more like the severity of the disease so kind of like when someone has died INAUDIBLE (35:29) they already INAUDIBLE (35:32) different but an and if someone has diabetes but they are still in the early stage of the disease then they don’t have as much um symptoms and that’s how I see it, I actually see it this um this criteria as a a like additional like help to diagnose but the core I think would be the first two criteria, which is the difficulty and why its difficult for them to let go of things.\n",
      "P3: So somebody can have hoarding disorder and not actually have as much clutter because-\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "P3: What really for you defines the disorder is the difficulty discarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah yeah, although I know that the criteria says this is a very important one and it’s a necessary one.\n",
      "P3: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: But yeah I think people who who are more more financially resourceful so they actually have another house that is meant for their clutter to go to and more storage units, yeah.\n",
      "P3: So um we were just about to ask about that yeah, so it sounds like how much space you have also kind of can play a role.\n",
      "What about other people in the home who might control the space, do you think that um living with someone who who is in control of the space can impact it?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, and that’s why in uh in I think in this particular INAUDIBLE (37:02) relationship criteria also say it's not because of other people it is intervening the place.\n",
      "P3: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah and I, its common they live with family members but it's more under control.\n",
      "P3: Mhm mhm okay.\n",
      "P1: Okay another question we had for you, so for healthy individuals there seems to be be a degree of variance in the amount of free space they might like in their home so for example, some people might prefer to have uh uh clear counter top while others prefer to have some things out and and ready to use.\n",
      "Could hoarding disorder you think just be an extension of this variance that surpasses a socially acceptable threshold?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm uh, I don’t think that is INAUDIBLE (38:01) yeah I think they’re I actually think that it's not a continuum this it uh um I think it’s a different thing, it's not only because they want something to be out there so it's easier to use, it more fear based its like if I don’t do this I may have negative consequences, so in this way I think these are different.\n",
      "P3: Okay\n",
      "P1: Okay\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. So the next one we’d like you to talk us through is, um, the criteria states: the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially comprise their intended use.\n",
      "So the first thing that maybe you can talk through for us is the idea of clutter and how you determine what counts as clutter.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Um, I’ll just make a brief comment so it doesn’t drive me nuts.\n",
      "I don’t know why they had to day congest and clutter.\n",
      "It seems to me that if you’re congested, you’re cluttered.\n",
      "And if you’re cluttered, you’re congested, but oh well.\n",
      "Not my decision.\n",
      "Um, so, what constitutes clutter?\n",
      "In my experience, it is a… the word random comes to mind, but they’re not always random.\n",
      "It is a mixture of objects that are lying on top of each other, on top of furnishings, on the floor, and I guess those are the only two places they can possibly be.\n",
      "I’m looking around the living room I am sitting in.\n",
      "if I were to clutter this room, what would that look like?\n",
      "Um, so it is a pile of mix use objects that don’t necessarily go together, and that’s the disorganization part of it.\n",
      "If, however, I walked into a home and I saw a stack of books lined up that, you know, in some fashion that looked like they belong together, even if they were stacked up right, it doesn’t constitute clutter until the quantity gets to the point where you just can’t use things in the space.\n",
      "So I could clutter this room very neatly by adding a huge pile of books all over the place.\n",
      "And I could keep them neat, and I probably would have a hoarding problem if you could verify that I had trouble parting with all those books.\n",
      "Interviewer: So the disorganization seems to play a role, but it is not necessary.\n",
      "Interviewee: It’s not absolutely necessary.\n",
      "Every now and again, you bump into an organized hoarder, um, but they can’t let them go and there you have it.\n",
      "It’s rare.\n",
      "It’s quite rare.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like something like home size might play into whether or not someone, um, someone’s space is considered cluttered?\n",
      "Like if someone has a huge basement versus if they live in a one trailer home.\n",
      "Interviewee: I’m sure there’s some truth to that, but someone with a significant hoarding problem would have to have more than a basement or attic that was full of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhmm\n",
      "Interviewee: They would, they would need, it has to be in living spaces and it has to impede their use or you don’t have a hoarding problem, you just have somebody who owns a lot of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "This is actually my first interview I've done with this project.\n",
      "So thank you for that.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well, you've done a good job.\n",
      "You can go on with confidence.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Do you have a few more minutes where I can ask you about specifically COVID-19 and spending the time alone, how that's impacted you?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So right off the bat, how has quarantine impacted your life?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well, it made me realize, like in the first two weeks, I realized how active I really am.\n",
      "I didn't realize I was as busy as I am with friends and my volunteer job, how much I was on the go all the time.\n",
      "So, that was the first realization.\n",
      "And I had been feeling tired, and I thought, \"Now I know why.\"\n",
      "It also has helped me get more rest.\n",
      "I made the decision that because of my age, and I've been having some problems with my throat and I thought.\n",
      "This is not a good time to be out among people.\n",
      "So I made the decision that I was going to do my best to not go into places.\n",
      "So, I do my grocery shopping by curbside only.\n",
      "Anything I need to buy, if I've had to buy anything from a store it's been curbside pickup.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And-\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Continue with your sentence, sorry for interrupting.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "No, I wasn't sure if I was answering the right question.\n",
      "I stopped to think, \"Okay, exactly what did she ask me?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I just asked you very generally.\n",
      "So now I'll ask you some more specific stuff.\n",
      "How has quarantine and not going out as much affected your acquiring new items?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Not at all.\n",
      "Because I really wasn't doing much shopping anyway.\n",
      "I ordered two things online that I had been wanting anyway.\n",
      "So ordered those no matter what, but I haven't ordered any clothes.\n",
      "So I've stayed out of all the stores, and I only online ordered two things that I needed.\n",
      "So I would say it hasn't affected that.\n",
      "But, I had really cut way back on my shopping a few years ago.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how has being in your home more frequently affected efforts to declutter?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Initially, I was doing really well.\n",
      "I thought, \"Okay, I'm going to really get things in order.\"\n",
      "So I have filled four decent boxes with papers that, when this is over, I need to take somewhere for shredding.\n",
      "Initially I thought I can shred these, but then when I realized how many I had, I thought, I don't think I have enough life left to shred all these papers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I think just going from area to area and tossing things into boxes, like donate, destroy, recycle, shred.\n",
      "Maybe shred and destroy are the same.\n",
      "Some things are confidential information.\n",
      "You want to shred so no one can ever read it.\n",
      "Others are just recyclable material.\n",
      "And then things you definitely want to keep or donate or share different donation spots in mind, you'd have, for me, I conceive it as a project of having areas on the bed, our large bed laid out as where to place these things or boxes.\n",
      "Just sort them out.\n",
      "And it's just work from there on.\n",
      "What are you donating to Goodwill or to whatever they, the senior center or where ever you have places that you can donate stuff to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It sounds like from how you're talking, that whenever, discarding items may not cause a ton of stress or duress for you.\n",
      "And that's not the reason you're keeping the items.\n",
      "It might just be that they've had value for you up to this moment and it's the action of actually getting around to evaluating if they still hold that value for you.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "That's a good way of putting it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's just-\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "And if there's something that I just don't have any use for, it's broken or I don't even want to look at it anymore, then throw it away.\n",
      "But otherwise, I don't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "There isn't necessarily a supreme attachment to most of the items that you have.\n",
      "It seems that you keep them for the purpose of wanting to be useful, whether that be to you or to other individuals, like you said, history taking.\n",
      "So how you distinguish normal saving behavior such as collecting and then behavior like yours, with difficulties with clutter to the point where you can't see the floor in a certain room.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I know for me, it's like I said, the quality of things, like the variety of things I'm keeping, not because I feel an attachment, but because I feel the possibility of needing the item in the future.\n",
      "I don't have a place.\n",
      "I'm disorganized, so I don't have clear, defined places for different types of things.\n",
      "Like I know which drawers I have, which kinds of shirts and underwear and socks and such.\n",
      "And so I hang up hangable clothes and so on.\n",
      "And so clothing is not usually a disorder.\n",
      "It seems pretty well organized.\n",
      "But now, I've been working for the census most of the year.\n",
      "I've got my writing.\n",
      "I've got personal papers and bills and so on, which I keep sorting and moving around because I don't have well defined places in which to keep each type of document or paper or publication.\n",
      "028\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The next part of the interview will be a series of questions that I'll ask you just generally about hoarding, and its effect on your, and your feelings regarding it.\n",
      "The first thing that I'd like to discuss with you is to have you describe your problems with clutter and hoarding, and how long this has been going on.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "I think it's probably been going on always.\n",
      "I've always collected things, like for sentimental reasons, and I've always collected things because I just like how they look, and probably since I moved in to my own space that has more space, like early on I didn't.\n",
      "Growing up, I had my bedroom where I could collect things in, and then I had a small studio apartment that I shared with somebody that I was respectful of their space.\n",
      "But the bigger my space got, now I have a house and a garage, and I've lived here for 33 years, so in the last 33 years, with the more space, it's fully gotten to be more noticeable, this issue.\n",
      "I feel I always had this tendency, but now that I live here, and my husband does not have an issue with it, so I often wonder if I had married somebody who was very meticulous and is a minimalist, whether the marriage would have lasted, you know?\n",
      "Or whether I would've modified and just got used to a different way, but boy, that would've been tough.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's a lot to think about and consider.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How severe would you say that this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "How severe?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "That seems like a very unscientific question, but that's okay, because, you know, what I compare myself to, which helps me rationalize and feel okay about myself, is those programs that either used to be on TV called Hoarders.\n",
      "Did you ever watch that series?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I have seen it, yes.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, so I watched that for a period of time.\n",
      "I used to record it and watch them, and it definitely reassured me that I am okay, so how serious it is based on having seen it is how bad it can be.\n",
      "That's a true judgment.\n",
      "I mean, it can be really bad, I feel, for those people.\n",
      "But I also have some friends who are minimalists, and then I have friends who are regular folk in this spectrum, so compared to most of the people I know, it's medium severe.\n",
      "But compared to the people I've seen on TV and have heard of who are mentally ill, I think, I am somewhere medium.\n",
      "You know, like low-medium.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you mind describing your area right now, the space that you live in?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Where I'm sitting or generally all the different areas?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead and do a brief overview of all of the areas if you feel comfortable.\n",
      "And, I did clean out a drawer.\n",
      "In spite of all this, I'm trying to declutter.\n",
      "Based on my age, I'm thinking, \"I need to be decluttering.\"\n",
      "Well sometimes, some of those things that I've taken out of the drawer to clean it out, end up on the top of the countertop, because I'm not sure where I want to put those immediately.\n",
      "But, I do want the drawer to be empty, so I can use it for another purpose.\n",
      "But I can walk through it without tripping.\n",
      "That's really important to me at my age.\n",
      "I have one of the boxes, is a burn box.\n",
      "So stuff that needs to be shredded or burned.\n",
      "I put in there.\n",
      "And I have another one that's stuff that I can take to my recycle bin.\n",
      "So those are on the floor, and I paint, I'm an artist for a hobby.\n",
      "So there's also a box of canvases on the floor, and some baskets that have magazines, papers, art supplies.\n",
      "You can see why I don't want anyone coming in here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is this just your-\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Then I have my computer ...\n",
      "Go ahead, sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, you're okay.\n",
      "Is this just your office space?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "This is just my office space.\n",
      "Yeah ... I have my computer and way too many cords because I have all sorts of devices hooked up.\n",
      "I have a lot of notebooks for my volunteer, I actually need them.\n",
      "And it's actually being quite organized to have them, but just because I keep each case in a particular, in an individual notebook.\n",
      "I'm a guardian at [inaudible 00:24:49], I don't know if you know what that is?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I love to hear that.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Oh, you're welcome.\n",
      "So for each case, I have notebooks.\n",
      "And I have training materials, notebook, so it's a lot of papers, highlighters, little sticky tabs.\n",
      "So yeah, so that's it.\n",
      "It's you know, magnifying glass ...\n",
      "There's also a nail file here, and reading glasses, little extraneous.\n",
      "Lots of little notepads, so when you wanted to give me a telephone number, I have something to write on and pens.\n",
      "But I do have a pen drawer that every now and then I collect up the pens, put them all back in the drawer and start over.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "They have their place.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "And the rest of the house, you would come in and like I said, it just looks like a normal house, couch and chairs, and television.\n",
      "Everything is all in place.\n",
      "I would say that my greatest failing in that part of the house is the kitchen right now, because I live alone, nobody has come in here for four months.\n",
      "So I will leave some dishes in the sink sometimes now, whereas I didn't use to do that.\n",
      "But I mean, not piles of them, one or two days at the most.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting.\n",
      "That is an interesting question.\n",
      "Ok. I really appreciate your time in talking with us today.\n",
      "This will be extremely valuable for us and thank you so much for your work as well.\n",
      "I think that I speak for both of us when I say that we have enjoyed reading what you written and published on this topic.\n",
      "We’ve gained a lot from that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well…good…go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer: That was it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Well it was very nice to talk to you and good luck with your research.\n",
      "Interviewer: Before I let you go, just really quick, to tap into your kind of expertise and your knowledge on hoarding research, if you were to like think of other people who you think that it’s absolutely vital that we talk to.\n",
      "Could you think of anybody, or would you prefer that we email and ask you this question so you can think about it?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well you probably already have a list of folks that you have either contacted or are going to be contacting.\n",
      "Um, I’m sure I would hit upon many of those people.\n",
      "If there is anybody that occurs to me beyond that, I would be glad to tell you.\n",
      "You may or may not…Are you allowed to tell me who’s on the radar screen?\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, I mean, I’m not actually sure if we are or not, but I think that the purpose of asking that question is to make sure that we are being comprehensive and that we…\n",
      "Interviewee: So the one’s… I’ll just throw out the names of the people that I work most closely with across the country.\n",
      "Um, you’ve got NAME [1:03:04] you have to because everything I’ve written is with him.\n",
      "The um, NAME [1:03:11] at UNIVERSITY [1:03:12] is working on this problem from a more cognitive and community perspective.\n",
      "NAME [1:03:19] is one of my doc students who is working with NAME [1:03:25] now.\n",
      "She’s also at UNIVERSITY [1:03:26], and um, she’s former, she’s you know, well on her way to, she’s on the faculty.\n",
      "NAME [1:03:37], I’m sure you’ve bumped into.\n",
      "NAME [1:03:41] works on family aspects of hoarding, PHASSOM.\n",
      "Um, ok, I’m walking around the table.\n",
      "NAME [1:03:56] out in San Diego working on older adults with hoarding and treatment.\n",
      "She’s got somebody she works with as well.\n",
      "Of course she’s got NAME [1:04:10] at UNIVERSITY [1:04:13].\n",
      "Uh, NAME [1:04:18] has done a good bit of clinical work on hoarding.\n",
      "NAME [1:04:24] likewise, clinical work with people who hoard and their family members.\n",
      "Um, NAME [1:04:34].\n",
      "He is not a clinician, not a mental health clinician.\n",
      "He’s the housing guy that I mentioned and um, is I think a very rare person who developed a hoarding treatment program through the Boston housing group.\n",
      "Metropolitan Boston housing partnership with, they just changed their name and I forget what it is now, um Metro Boston housing, that’s it.\n",
      "Um, and has had huge experience with hoarding in the context of housing situations but also works with it extensively so knows a lot of these people.\n",
      "I’m sure there are more that I am forgetting.\n",
      "Interviewer: Would it be helpful if we sent you an email?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "You can always shoot me an email, and if anybody else occurs to me, I may or may not remember which ones I named already, but you got those or something.\n",
      "Close enough.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it's like decision making.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "And makes the decisions, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "I'm a psych major so I understand what you're saying.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so, you said that you've gone to classes but have you gone to a professional like a psychologist or a psychiatrist or anything?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Not about this, about clutter or hoarding.\n",
      "About other things but not about this, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And why do you think you haven't gone for clutter or hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I guess because I just didn't think it was that big of a deal to talk to a professional about.\n",
      "Like thinking that it's something that would be so easy to fix but a decade would go by without my fixing it.\n",
      "So, \"Ahem.\n",
      "Participant 32, wake up.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how do your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I don't notice my family noticing it or saying anything particularly about it because I don't see my family very often.\n",
      "But my friends, local friends, who are aware of it occasionally...\n",
      "Well, I think they feel for me.\n",
      "They feel sorry that I have this problem and occasionally they give me suggestions and sometimes offer to help me in the declutter process.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and how do you feel about those suggestions?\n",
      "Do you welcome them or do you feel like it's not their place?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Well, I love the idea of it but I don't say yes to it because I'm fearful that it will cause a rift in my relationship with them because I'm fearful of my reaction to what they say or suggest.\n",
      "So yeah, I just don't want to do it that way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's fair because...\n",
      "So, it sounds like you want to avoid conflict.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, for sure.\n",
      "I did... I will say when I moved... I sold the house, yeah, almost three years ago now.\n",
      "And I thought I had a perfect opportunity to be decluttering and organizing and all that and I gave carload after carload of stuff away to a humane society thrift shop and I even hired an organizer.\n",
      "I think I had her out for two or three different days for parts of those days to help me go through things.\n",
      "And so, she was somebody I did not know and so that seemed to go fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "So, it was because there wasn't that personal relationship that you were okay with getting help from someone else?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and have you ever had conflicts in the past with people close to you or your landlords about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "No, no I haven't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and so now we're moving on to section two, which is about space and living area.\n",
      "So, could you please describe where you live now?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I would say somewhere in the middle, somewhere moderately up.\n",
      "Not that I can't believe... I kind of look around in my house and I can't believe it looks like this, especially my parents always kept a very tidy house, but then again, they had a huge house.\n",
      "They had places to put all of the things that they used on a daily basis.\n",
      "For us, there's a stack of my kids' homework books under the living room coffee table because that's the best place to put them.\n",
      "That's where we can get them easily and work on them and then find them again.\n",
      "I don't know, but my parents never would have gone for something like that.\n",
      "I think that I could get rid of a lot of stuff.\n",
      "It could be a lot better, but it's not dangerous.\n",
      "It could be a lot worse also.\n",
      "It's mostly functional.\n",
      "I would say somewhere in the middle, moderately bad, moderately severe.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, moderately...\n",
      "Not dangerous, could be better, could be worse.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change your clutter problems or gone to a professional for help with clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, identify like a professional would understand.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "For one thing, it would cost extra money.\n",
      "We're kind of keeping the budget as tight as possible and it feels like it's something I should be able to do myself and it's something that I could understand more personally about what I would want to do than a professional could, although doesn't everyone think that and [inaudible 00:15:56] always professionals usually do a better job of things than you ever could do on your own.\n",
      "I would say that we probably would never actually pay money for someone to do that.\n",
      "There are just too many other things that are more important than that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "So it would cost extra money.\n",
      "There are other things that are higher on the priority list that would be more worth or it would be worth it to spend money on those things before that.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "It's something that you feel like you should be able to do yourself.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You said moving into your house and what your space is like.\n",
      "I know you described that it's a small house and you have your husband and two kids.\n",
      "Do you have any animals that live with you as well.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "We have two cats.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Two cats.\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "I love cats, but unfortunately, my wife is very allergic, so we have a dog instead.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:17:09].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does your home currently look like how you would like it to look?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, it does not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How would you like your home to look?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I feel like I'm being redundant if I say uncluttered or neat and tidy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you had to apply this criterion with the intent of diagnosing someone with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Are there things about the DSM-5 criteria that are sometimes challenging, you know, elements that you regard as difficult to apply, or might apply differently to different clinicians, things to do with language perhaps?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm I don’t have it-- I don’t have the language right in front of me, but because I think that that was how I was trained, was with what ultimately ended up being the DSM-5 criteria, or pretty close to it, I generally just, I guess like it in comparison to the DSM-4.\n",
      "I feel like it’s a lot more clear to be able to diagnose, so I don’t have any big concerns about it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. So next we want to ask you some questions about the way that you think about specific things related to the DSM-5 criteria.\n",
      "So, I’m going to read you a phrase that we have from the criteria, and then I want to know a little bit more about your thought process as you apply two different patients.\n",
      "So, one of the phrases is “persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value.”\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, with that, how do you go about determining value?\n",
      "What makes the value judgement of an individual with hoarding disorder as inappropriate?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure, well I mean, there are some cases that are very clear cut-- If it’s actually like garbage or, you know, food waste or things like that.\n",
      "Obviously, it’s much more clear cut and there are many items that are pretty inexpensive, like you know, that are less than a few dollars or less than a dollar that they have a bunch of-- I think that would be lower value, things that most people would probably discard unless they had an immediate plan for it, like things like toilet paper rolls or stuff like that-- Most people are going to get rid of, unless they have a certain art project that they’re going to use it for in the next couple of months or something.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: So yeah, I mean mostly value.\n",
      "I think most people would probably agree that things are of a lower value like with under a few dollars or less than dollar, ideally.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so that value, to you, kind of more means a monetary value as opposed to emotional or aesthetic value?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "I mean the emotional or aesthetic value-- Let’s say it’s greeting cards or something, where it’s from someone who is very much in their life and, you know, they have every expectation that they will continue to receive cards from them.\n",
      "I mean, most people might save a special card or two, but not every card that they’ve gotten from the person.\n",
      "So that has a little bit more of when there’s a sentimental value.\n",
      "How many items are you keeping?\n",
      "Do you need to keep every single one versus, you know, one or two things that remind you of the person?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So, at that point it’s not necessarily the inappropriate value judgement, so much as the amount that they have of that item?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "This one Mr. John Doe has several books that he keeps in case he needs to use in the future.\n",
      "Books occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.\n",
      "Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Sounds like a clutter problem, bordering on hoarding disorder I guess.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Books in the bathtub seems kind of crazy to me.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I guess that's [inaudible 00:48:00] for a hoarding disorder, but it sounds like it's on a whole milder level.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So milder hoarding disorder or borderline?\n",
      "Not as severe as the one just before this?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Similar to the questions that I asked before, should this person try to seek change or try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you were in their shoes, would you decide to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "It sounds like the situation could be manageable.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I guess if you tried to seek change and you couldn't, then you should probably see a professional.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You would probably see how much that you could work on changing that behavior before?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Reaching out.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is this similar or different to your clutter problems in any way?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I've certainly spent 10 or 20 minutes looking for an item I use routinely.\n",
      "I try to have special places for the important things.\n",
      "I think I've been doing better at that.\n",
      "It's not something I've really been keeping track of.\n",
      "It sounds like... I mean I definitely don't have to remove anything from the bathtub before I take a shower though.\n",
      "Sounds like maybe he's a little bit worse than me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So there's some similarities and some differences?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I'd be upset if I was this guy, but I don't think I'm quite as bad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "The 10 to 20 minutes maybe looking for items that kind of relates or you can see some comparisons there, but you don't have to take things out of the bathtub in order to take a shower?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Hmm. Well, that's hard for me to say because I do have a couple or a few collections myself.\n",
      "But I have worked really hard to not go overboard, what I consider overboard, and there's no cut and dry number of objects in a collection that is the limit to what's normal and what's hoarding.\n",
      "So, that's...\n",
      "It depends on so many factors, how much space you have, and how much money you have, and how much tolerance for...\n",
      "Anyway, I don't know.\n",
      "So, it seems to me that if one has more of a certain object in a collection that can comfortably and aesthetically fit into whatever container or display case or whatever it is that one has set up for it, then one could consider it to be a hoarding situation.\n",
      "If you've got overflow or just everything's packed in so tight you can't even see what all the objects are, and they're spilling over or you have boxes of whatever that object is that you never could unpack because there's no room for it, that's going too far.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "So, it's all about going back to that idea of everything having its place and not overflowing or seeming overly stuffed in there.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, that's my sensibility about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Hmm, that's a really good question.\n",
      "I suppose if it's...\n",
      "It depends.\n",
      "If it's a long-term relationship, you know this person, you've had many conversations with the person, if you notice this person talking about acquiring another blah, blah, blah whatever this thing is, but you know that they already have acquired and... I don't know, I'm not real clear on how to articulate this but I think through conversation one could get an idea that somebody is a hoarder from what they say, what they talk about, and or how they describe their home situation.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so just like conversationally you may be able to pick up on it?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "I know that you said you read books about decluttering but have you read books on the disorder itself or have you watched any TV shows or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I haven't read books about hoarding.\n",
      "I have seen a couple of those...\n",
      "The great shows like... I don't know if it's Oprah or who but over the last couple of decades I've seen once or twice only shows that just blew my mind how a person can...\n",
      "It makes me feel like my problem is no problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it kind of puts things into perspective like that it could be worse?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Oh my goodness, yes, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah. I think that's...\n",
      "If he continues to because in his case the antiques, it doesn't seem like they could have sentiment value if he's buying them, and if they're in every room, it's not like he has a collection of antiques that are displayed and that...\n",
      "It doesn't sound like he could enjoy them.\n",
      "I think if it's in the way of being able to get into rooms, I think that's a problem.\n",
      "Also if he goes out every week antique shopping or you can go out antique shopping every week, but if you buy something every time you go out, I think that's, there's an issue.\n",
      "Sort of like a compulsive shopping kind of issue.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think he would require treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I guess part of it is like if it doesn't bother him, and it doesn't effect anybody else, probably not, but if it's effecting his ability... I can't remember if you said that if he's one where he can't find anything, and...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "He spends 30 minutes to an hour looking for things until he finds them or forgets what he's looking for.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It depends like if it doesn't bother him and it doesn't interfere with his relationships with other people, and it doesn't keep him from meeting commitments that he has, I'd say he probably doesn't really need professional help.\n",
      "Or it depends, like does he think it's a problem?\n",
      "So if he doesn't think it's a problem, and it's not effecting anyone else, and it's not a fire hazard, I don't think he needs professional help.\n",
      "That's kind of borderline.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Do you think his behavior is similar to your own or mostly different?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "It's different.\n",
      "Because I don't... I don't go out and buy things all the time.\n",
      "Although, you would think he doesn't have an emotional attachment to things, but it could be that it's something really speaks to him, when he's out at antique stores, and maybe he does have an emotional attachment.\n",
      "Maybe he buys things, [inaudible 00:50:54] buying things because he thinks this might valuable, and if I just keep it for a while, I can sell it, and make a little money or does he buy things because it really speaks to him, and he has no intention of selling that or giving it away or getting rid of it?\n",
      "I think that's a little more problematic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For this next section of the interview, we're going to talk a little bit about COVID, in particular, and how it's impacted you.\n",
      "Have you noticed any sorts of behaviors changing because of COVID?\n",
      "Then they came to me and they said, \"We need more people to work on an elevated level, with an increased knowledge,\" et cetera, et cetera.\n",
      "Since I was an RN, they wanted to make me an epidemiologist, basically, helping the existing epis do direct contact with the cases.\n",
      "I took a look and I thought, okay, they've got a real need, because the case load's picking up significantly.\n",
      "I'm the only person out of the 100 or whatever of us that was an RN.\n",
      "Basically, working a 12 hour shift meant that ... I have two dogs at home, and I would take my one hour lunch break to drive home like a mad woman, let the dogs out to pee, and what have you, and grab a sandwich out of the fridge or whatever, and eat it on the way driving back.\n",
      "I thought, I don't want to do 12 hour shifts anymore.\n",
      "I negotiated four 10s a week, and a willingness to do extra partial days.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You've been keeping super busy.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "They said, that's not in the pattern ...\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You've been keeping extremely busy.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "It worked really well, until just before the 4th of July, when supervisor came to me and said, we need continuity and all the other epis, all of these kids that graduated with their masters in public health couldn't find any jobs, and so they were getting staffed up with epis.\n",
      "Plus, I'm monolingual, and some of these kids also spoke Spanish and Vietnamese.\n",
      "That really helped with our population.\n",
      "The need wasn't there anymore.\n",
      "Basically, it came down to, they needed for me to work the same shift as the rest of the epis were, which was six days a week, eight-hour shifts.\n",
      "I thought, no. Not going to do it.\n",
      "And, had also started having trouble with sleep, after working with some of my case families.\n",
      "It's just-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Stressful.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "... awful.\n",
      "Anyway.\n",
      "I held onto-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "To decide it wasn't worth it.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "... I thought nope, I can't do six eights.\n",
      "Cannot do it.\n",
      "They released me from my contract.\n",
      "I'm back home again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You were keeping busy for a while there, but then it just sounds like it didn't work out.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I was keeping busy.\n",
      "Wasn't dealing with the clutter.\n",
      "That's kind of, thinking back now, in 2005, I started working as a consultant.\n",
      "Rather than being a clinician or nurse educator based in the healthcare system, I was traveling.\n",
      "My life from 2005 to 2016 was generally getting on a plane on Sundays, and traveling to the client site, and then traveling back home on a Thursday or Friday.\n",
      "Then, doing it again.\n",
      "P3: Okay so um should I do the next question NAME (20:06)?\n",
      "P1: Yeah so now we're just talking about yeah DSM five yeah mhm.\n",
      "P3: Yeah so were just going to ask some questions about the DSM five criteria.\n",
      "Um so we can better understand the way that clinicians understand these criteria um, and how they pertain to diagnoses.\n",
      "Um so have you ever had to apply the DSM five criteria with the intent of diagnosing an individual according to disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah um\n",
      "P3: Are there things about those criteria that you sometimes find challenging or particular elements of the criteria that you think are particularly difficult to apply or that you think different clinicians might apply slightly differently?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm I believe so yeah um-\n",
      "P3: Anything that comes to mind?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm I think that um, I think uh the the the difficulties or emotional difficulties of letting go of stuff um this one can be tricky sometimes, especially uh when you interact with people who are um less aware of their their difficulties, they may say ‘oh I don’t have difficulties I can get rid of them I just don’t have time’ yeah so this one can be-\n",
      "P3: Okay, so that might be mhm do you feel like clinical judgment plays role in diagnosis of hoarding disorder and how would you compare that in your experience to the role of clinical judgment in other psychiatric disorders?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh can you say this again?\n",
      "I’m not quite sure, I don’t understand the question.\n",
      "P3: Yeah so this is just kind of wondering to what extent you think an individual clinician kind of clinical judgment about what constitutes hoarding disorder plays a role in in diagnoses, and what do you think that that’s that’s special with hoarding disorder, or whether it pertains to um all psychiatric disorders equally?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm I would imagine it would be similar um yeah, I I I don’t think that that um clinicians would have more or less personal influence on how they they diagnose hoarding that other diagnoses but of course I think um each individual um clinicians may have their own bias that may lead them to um diagnose someone with ‘A’ diagnoses more than ‘B’ diagnoses.\n",
      "But I think overall across all clinicians I don’t think that hoarding disorder may be more or less bias then other diagnoses.\n",
      "P3: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: uh, well not now, that I say it I think that um I guess because because hoarding is still very new so, not a lot of people, not a lot of clinicians are sensitive as sensitive about hoarding then are other diagnose such as hm major depression, so they may not have the clinical sensitivity to think of ‘oh I wonder if I should go through this with this person?’.\n",
      "P3: Mhm mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so it can be under diagnosed yeah.\n",
      "P3: Mhm, okay um want to take the next one NAME (32:48)?\n",
      "P1: Yeah, so uh now we want ask you some questions about how you think about specific DSM five criteria, so I’m gonna read you a phrase and I want to know a little bit more about your thought process when applying it to an individual patient.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "P1: So one of the phrases in the DSM is the ‘persistent difficulty discarding and/or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value’ so-\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm\n",
      "P1: How is it that you’re determining value and what makes the value judgment that someone with hoarding disorder makes inappropriate?\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm hm yeah so I try to interpret um this criteria as the value that most people, or people who don’t have sentimental values with this item would consider the value of this thing for example like a receipt or plastic shopping bags or or yeah, or containers of food that they have consumed, so these would be um I think what the criteria mean by um regardless of the values, meaning that its not valuable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It seems like you're fairly open, and you're comfortable with the fact that this hoarding disorder is something that you experience, but you seem to be almost proud in a way that it doesn't drastically affect your life.\n",
      "But it is something that bothers you on an individual level.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah, that's pretty true.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "But yeah, it definitely bothers me and I still hoping to overcome this, in this lifetime.\n",
      "I don't know how much time I have left to work on it.\n",
      "But I would love, I've said that to myself so many times.\n",
      "I would feel so proud if I could overcome this.\n",
      "I mean I give stuff to charity all the time.\n",
      "I take stuff to the [inaudible 00:36:22] thrift store, I do get rid of stuff.\n",
      "But, I have so much stuff that it just doesn't make enough of a dent.\n",
      "So I'm trying to get rid of it even more.\n",
      "And that's something I keep in the garage.\n",
      "In the garage I have ...\n",
      "Right now, I actually have five boxes that I put items in when I come across them, and I think, \"Okay, this can go.\"\n",
      "So I really want to overcome this in this lifetime.\n",
      "I don't want anyone to have to clean up after me when I'm gone.\n",
      "Can you hold on ...\n",
      "Wait, I can take the phone with me.\n",
      "My dog, I think she needs to go outside.\n",
      "She never gets up from her pillow while I'm on the phone.\n",
      "So I think she might need to go potty, but it's raining.\n",
      "Are we coming near the end?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Or is there still quite a bit to go?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "There's a fair amount left to go, but we can try to go a little bit more quickly through it.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I'm not trying to hurry you, because I know I'm doing most of the talking.\n",
      "I'm just trying to figure out whether I need to ...\n",
      "Maybe I'll just walk outside with my phone and see if she can go potty, okay?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "You can keep talking, I'm walking with my phone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "You can let me know if the reception gets poor.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Will do.\n",
      "I wanted to ask, so it seems that at times the behavior of hoarding or of accumulation, it upsets you.\n",
      "Has there ever been a time in your life when the hoarding got in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "... At the time when I told you that I was really depressed and couldn't deal with things.\n",
      "Then I let the main part of my house get messy at times, and I didn't want anyone to come in.\n",
      "Is that the sort of thing you mean?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "No. I have a housemate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "And then sometimes I have his two children each individually living with us in the third bedroom.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you feel that your space would look any different if you didn't have a roommate?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "It would be improved.\n",
      "He has adult ADHD, which he says is partly responsible for his apparently not cleaning up after himself and things like that.\n",
      "For him, it's a real effort to just take care of busy household chores.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does he also keep items or is it more so just day to day cleanliness?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Day to day cleanliness.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's got to be frustrating [crosstalk 00:18:50] at times.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Pardon?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's got to be frustrating at times.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Oh yes, yes.\n",
      "Also, doesn't work or pay rent.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so whenever you think about the items that you do keep, you mentioned a few qualifiers for what makes them valuable to you, but do you mind going through those again?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Of what those things are-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of what makes the items that you keep valuable to you.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I keep documents like diplomas and awards and photographs and art works.\n",
      "I do photography as a hobby, mostly photographs of flowers.\n",
      "And I have papered my bathroom walls and some other walls with some photographs of mine.\n",
      "I will soon make four by six blank note cards with my photographs.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Cool.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "For personal notes, like when I go to the marijuana store or when I go to a restaurant and leave a tip, I often leave a card.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's awesome.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "So that they have a nice private note with a little bit of eye candy and they can then write whatever they wish to whomever, put it in the envelope that I provide and add a stamp.\n",
      "And a uniformed officer of the government delivers it without reading it to whoever.\n",
      "A handwritten note to your grandma today will make her day today.\n",
      "And she'll probably remember it for years to come.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, my grandmother loved receiving notes.\n",
      "That was something [crosstalk 00:21:04].\n",
      "Yeah, in the last few years of her life, that was important to her.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And the same thing's true for your parents or good friends or politicians you like.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you happen to-\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Enclose the rent check in the card with a pretty picture on it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you then keep any notes that you receive from others?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Some, but most of them eventually get either put in the file cabinet or lost.\n",
      "And since I'm looking to move in a couple of months, I've got to get busy with tossing things and donating process.\n",
      "There is memories attached to them.\n",
      "But I have three boxes up in my studio of other things that have sentimental value to them, and I can't have them all out in my house if there's not enough space, so I switch them out.\n",
      "That has evolved into, \"Hey, if I put stuff that isn't really sentimental value, but useful, but haven't used it, and I might not actually use it, if I just start a box like that, then I can just get rid of that box.\"\n",
      "A lot of rationalizing going on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You're very aware of it though, which is interesting to hear, because you acknowledge that it does cause you discomfort at times, yet there are reasons that make sense to keep the items, too.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, and you know, I do have a background in psychology and mental health, and I believe in looking at myself and trying to improve myself, like I don't want to have low self-esteem, so if I find I do I want to have a strategy to work on that, and I found if certain things are too difficult to work on, I have to work on my attitude about them.\n",
      "Like, \"Well, if you're not willing to change that, then change the way you feel about it.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is a very good way to look at things.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's something I could learn from you.\n",
      "This leads me into a question about have you ever sought professional help to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "No, I've sought professional help a couple times for different things.\n",
      "You know, marriage counseling years ago, and then help with my daughter's mental health issues, and the one time I saw that therapist about my daughter's stuff, she mentioned that she specializes in helping people declutter their home, and so I good naturedly shared with her that, \"Oh, I have that problem.\n",
      "That might be interesting.\"\n",
      "And she wanted to tell me all about how she does that and how positive it's been for so many people, and the more I heard about her process, like actually coming into my home and helping me go through things and stuff, I felt my anxiety just go up, up, up.\n",
      "\"Oh my god, I could never have someone come in my home and help me do this.\n",
      "Oh my god.\"\n",
      "And that was really interesting to me.\n",
      "Plus, then she told me she charges 165 dollars an hour.\n",
      "I'm like, \"Holy crap.\n",
      "I should do that myself and put aside 165 dollars an hour for some special trip.\"\n",
      "Anyway, I didn't, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It seems like there's a lot of anxiety attached to discarding items and having to decide what should be kept and what can be let go of, and that's what's-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We'll move onto the next one.\n",
      "I'm guessing based on the fact that you said that you would say that he's fairly normal that you don't believe that this person should try to change their behavior or that they require treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The next one again is with Mr. John Doe.\n",
      "He has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he'll need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he most remove several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I think he has a hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think that he should try to change his behavior?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Should he see a psychiatrist or a psychologist to try to...\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I guess if... I don't know.\n",
      "I feel like we overuse perhaps psychologists.\n",
      "I think we're capable of doing a lot more on our own than we think.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "It's very hard for me to recommend to someone.\n",
      "I think whether you should see a psychologist or not is something that someone personally has to come to on his own.\n",
      "If I were him, maybe I would seek a psychologist if it...\n",
      "It sounds pretty bad, but I feel really uncomfortable telling other people they need psychiatric help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's fair.\n",
      "If you were in his situation, you said you might choose to see one.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:46:04] might be necessary.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How, again, is this either similar or different to what you would describe your own clutter problems to be?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I think [inaudible 00:46:33] what my clutter problems are, it sounds a lot worse than anything.\n",
      "At least I can move around in my house.\n",
      "My clutter is not actually typically in the way of anything.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:32:30] ... at least one person who I think probably has a serious problem.\n",
      "I've known her for probably about five or six years, and I just recently realized that she's an older person and he would talk about how financially strapped she was, but she lives alone in a pretty large house, and I remember one time I said...\n",
      "She was talking about she was on the verge of losing her house, and I said, \"Why don't you get a roommate?\" And she's like, \"Oh no. That's just out of the question.\"\n",
      "I always thought that was really odd, and then three or four months ago she, [inaudible 00:33:25] with the pandemic, I think it kind of made things worse, and I had heard from somebody that she is just staying in her house and she's not like [inaudible 00:33:47] but more like just mentally can't deal with things and can't get up out of bed, and couldn't go grocery shopping so one of our mutual friends took some food up to her.\n",
      "He said she wouldn't come to the door.\n",
      "She said, \"This is the combination to my garage door.\n",
      "Just open it and leave it in the garage.\"\n",
      "So that's what he did and left, and he didn't even see her, and that's kind of made me think, now I'm kind of adding things together.\n",
      "I think and things that she said, I'm kind of thinking that she probably does have a hoarding problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So definitely she has like, you've observed some reclusive tendencies, and also a little bit of being secretive, that sort of thing might be a tell in that case?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know you mentioned that you had seen some extreme causes of hoarding disorder, like on TV and stuff, but where else have you gotten any information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Well I remember, I think one of the first times I really heard of it was somebody telling me about somebody that he knew, and this was not somebody I knew, that he said, and he was married, so I don't know if it was her or the husband, but he said, that to go to their house was there was just a little, they had newspapers and things stacked all up in their living room, and there was just a little path to go through, and that was the first time I had ever heard of that, and I thought that's really odd to have, to not be able to walk, to have just a little narrow trail through your house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "This is our last one as far as the vignettes go.\n",
      "In this one, John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.\n",
      "He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "He's worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.\n",
      "Antiques occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes, that is definitely a disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Would you say that kind of similar to the other one that you said was definitely hoarding disorder that, yes, he should seek change and that if you were him, you would probably see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I would say definitely see a psychologist.\n",
      "That sounds more like a mental thing I guess than just a little disorganization.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know you've talked about in general you don't like to recommend to others to get psychiatric or psychological help.\n",
      "Would that be true for this particular person as well or is it bad enough that you would make that recommendation to them?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "That's a good question.\n",
      "It's true.\n",
      "When things get bad enough, I guess in this case, I probably would make that recommendation.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Again, any similarities or differences with yourself that you see here that are particularly poignant?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Very slight.\n",
      "I guess the biggest difference is that I am not a buyer.\n",
      "I do not buy things unless I need them of course.\n",
      "My hoarding usually comes from gifts or from just stuff that I somehow inquire.\n",
      "I don't ever deliberately go out and purchase things.\n",
      "When I feel like people are starting to financially impact themselves for stuff that is detrimental to them, then that becomes a real serious problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sounds like there's a real...\n",
      "Yeah, the financial impact for this person would definitely...\n",
      "Seems like would qualify for you as being an issue.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you so much for your insights on those.\n",
      "We're getting towards the end.\n",
      "The last questions are really all about COVID, which has a large impact on people now.\n",
      "Some of them will be more general and then some might be specifically with COVID and acquiring things.\n",
      "Just generally, how has COVID-19 impacted your life?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Been a very stressful situation and because he doesn't work, he's at home all the time.\n",
      "So you don't get that break from somebody that gives you the opportunity to look at other things, do other things and not react, not be always waiting for somebody to say or do something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It gives you a break from looking at the person.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Exactly, exactly.\n",
      "So everybody is, if you're quarantining at home with your family members and getting to know them all too well, it's like that.\n",
      "But it's been like that for the whole two years that I've been living with this person.\n",
      "And it's rarely a break, a sense of being in my own space and not having to go around cleaning up after someone who's not particularly conscious of-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The mess they're creating.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "The mess they're creating or doesn't have the understanding that there's three stages to say, having a meal.\n",
      "You get things together to prepare it, you get your utensils, your ingredients, whatever and make your sandwich or your souffle or whatever it is and then when you serve it, when you're finished, you don't just set down things where they are and assume they'll be taken care of by the clean up fairy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Which is you.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "There's an ending process, a cleaning up and putting away, recreating the status quo ante that is of the situation that was before.\n",
      "Put things back to the way they were before you started making your sandwich or creating that dish or whatever.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like that could be-\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "For the next person who walks into the space finds it as expected.\n",
      "And so it's basic consideration of others with whom you live that's lacking, that's like okay, I'm done with this can.\n",
      "Drop it.\n",
      "Okay, I've drunk half this bottle of soda, set it down on something, where it'll sit for weeks.\n",
      "Yeah, and his children have the same habits.\n",
      "So it's like, difficult to break through because they're, a condition, not of behavior I can change, but so it's like okay, sure.\n",
      "Thanks for the explanation.\n",
      "Now I'm your maid and your clean up lady as well as your rent payer.\n",
      "It drives me nuts.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's too much.\n",
      "And you mentioned the stress that that brings to you.\n",
      "How are you coping with that or getting some distance from it when you're not really able to leave your house and see other people conveniently?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Well, sometimes leaving the house and seeing other people is part of it and getting out to see friends, that's, part of it is, I belong to a couple of senior organizations.\n",
      "And their meeting's online now.\n",
      "And I'm in an addiction recovery group that's online that I participate in meetings there, as well.\n",
      "So those are ways to cope.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "But maybe...\n",
      "It could've started sooner than that when I bought my first house and had some space to fill up with clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you think it's that availability of space that kind of triggered your problems with clutter a little bit since you had more space, you were able to collect more things?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Since I had more space and commitment let's say, to being in the space since I purchased the house instead of renting.\n",
      "And before I purchased, I would move pretty often and when I knew I was going to be moving every few months or every year or so, I didn't accumulate as much stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, it was that sense of permanence that kind of allowed you?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, that's the way to put it.\n",
      "Yeah, uh-huh.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and how severe would you say that this behavior is now compared to let's say back in 2001 or in the past?\n",
      "Do you think it's gotten worse or better?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I think it's gotten better because it's driven me so crazy that I've been really trying to work on it.\n",
      "So yeah, I think I'm doing better a little bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and would you say that it's gotten better just in general because like you've said your mind is just so fed up with it?\n",
      "Or has that been a result of the coronavirus?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "No, it's just because I'm fed up with it.\n",
      "But I don't think the coronavirus has had anything to do with it because that didn't change my lifestyle really because...\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, gotcha.\n",
      "And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, oh yes.\n",
      "I think in classes...\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't interject.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, go ahead.\n",
      "No, you can go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, I've taken decluttering classes.\n",
      "I've bought several books on how to organize and declutter and of course I haven't read them but I have them.\n",
      "I've read the first chapter or two and that's as far as I seem to get.\n",
      "The intention is there, the intention to declutter and to not hoard is there but the follow-through to doing it is what I'm still having to work hard on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why do you think the follow-through is so difficult for you?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "I think for me because making decisions is difficult.\n",
      "I think it's more difficult than for maybe most people or the average person.\n",
      "And I think that is... I guess I want to blame it in part on some brain damage that happened when I was 17 in a really bad car crash and I didn't find out about this brain damage until 10 or 15 years later.\n",
      "But anyway, my frontal lobe was damaged and that's the area that organizes things and makes decisions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. And that kind of brings us to the part of the question that talks about intended use, um, the compromises of intended use.\n",
      "Interviewee: By the way, I think one of the things you also or want to be aware of, and I’m sure you know this, is that if someone else lives in the home and they protect the living spaces, and the, it’s only, it’s the spaces that the other person who has control over that is a disaster, that can be one hoarder in the home and on non-hoarder who has control.\n",
      "So you can have a disastrous basement and attic and have one of those people in the house.\n",
      "But, if you, if that house is lived in by only one person, then I have a hard time calling them a hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhmm.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok, I’m sorry, go back to your question.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so um, we were talking about kind of compromising use of the space and, we were wondering if you could talk through, again, what counts as compromised use and how, you know, people can come in, whether the person’s intent is to use the space for storage even though it happens to be a stove or countertop, and whether there are perhaps differences in how much free space an individual needs or likes to have around.\n",
      "If that can be part of what’s going on in hoarding disorder.\n",
      "INAUDIBLE [36:57]\n",
      "Interviewee: There, you know, there’s tremendous variability in everyday housekeeping by most people.\n",
      "And, so, it, hoarding, um, would be diagnosed if you will only if, I guess I can give you an example.\n",
      "If someone comes to the door, a friend, and wants to stop in to, I don’t know, invite you out or something.\n",
      "If you can’t happily sit them down in some comfortable space in your home because you have to run around and move boxes and stuff in order to make it pass-ible and/or whatever, then you’ve got a problem.\n",
      "So, people should be able to visit somewhat freely in anyone’s home and be received comfortably.\n",
      "Um, uh, what else do I want to say about that?\n",
      "So I guess what I’m saying is that in order to make space available that is livable, if it takes more than just a few minutes to do that, then you probably have a hoarding problem, unless the person is amidst some sort of renovation of the house or some major project that has got things in great disarray.\n",
      "But if this is a steady state and it can’t be cleaned up quickly, then there’s probably a problem.\n",
      "There are a lot of people who just, you know, throw stuff around and then run around once a month and clean it all up.\n",
      "That’s a different, that’s just a messy home.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, my objects.\n",
      "Yeah, no, I get it.\n",
      "Yeah, I just didn't catch the word.\n",
      "Well, yeah.\n",
      "Some of them I wouldn't feel like it's home without and that's... I have quite a few old books that belonged to grandparents and great grandparents, people that I love and I didn't even know, I never knew.\n",
      "But those are really important to me.\n",
      "I will probably never read most of these books if any of them.\n",
      "But having those old books does give me a sense of connection and a sense of having family in my home with me.\n",
      "So yeah, that kind of stuff it's hard to really imagine not having.\n",
      "But as far as so much of the clutter that I have...\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "No, this is where...\n",
      "It just puzzles me that I can't just break through this.\n",
      "So much of it is just unimportant stuff and it's just stuff that...\n",
      "Everyday stuff that a person buys when they need an object for whatever reason but why can't I just use it and be done with it?\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I mean I don't need to hold onto it.\n",
      "It's that thing of not wanting to waste anything I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, and that not wanting to waste anything...\n",
      "So, I know that you've mentioned you could potentially attribute that to your brain damage.\n",
      "But is there any family history with hoarding or problems with clutter that you know of?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Yes, there definitely is that.\n",
      "I remember my parents saying that my great aunt Eady was a...\n",
      "Well, I don't remember if they used the word hoarder but they would say that she cannot get rid of anything.\n",
      "She just hangs onto everything that she ever gets.\n",
      "So, she was very cluttered, supposedly.\n",
      "So, at least my great aunt had somewhat of a problem.\n",
      "I don't remember my parents being particularly that way.\n",
      "So yeah, really that's all I can think of.\n",
      "It's just what I was told because I honestly don't remember.\n",
      "I mean I was too young when she died to really understand that whole concept and to notice whether she had way too much stuff.\n",
      "And when I visited her house I don't remember having trouble walking through the house.\n",
      "I don't think she had stuff covering all the floors or anything like that, so anyway.\n",
      "Yeah, but that's more of a family story than my own actual remembered experience.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "And are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way they were intended?\n",
      "For example, some people have so much stuff that they put it in their bathtub so they're unable to use their bathtub.\n",
      "Or they have to put it on their stove, so they can't cook.\n",
      "Does any of this sound relatable to you?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And in the media, I know that there's that one show, on like TLC or something, like Hoarders.\n",
      "How do you feel about the people that are displayed in that show, if you've ever had any exposure to it?\n",
      "How do you think that they kind of different from your perspective of your clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "When those shows first came out, what was that?\n",
      "About 10 or 15 years ago, I used to watch them a lot, and then I kind of felt like I was really, that I could easily become that, and I felt like it sort of helped me, that watching those shows kind of helped me realize that even though I wasn't that extreme that it's something that I need to be aware of and watch out for.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so seeing kind of the extreme representations of them has kind of helped you a little bit with like the self-identification, it sounds like?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It also sounds like it's kind of motivated you to try and improve your problem a little bit too, as well.\n",
      "Is that accurate?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, that's true.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This next part of the interview, I'm going to read you a couple of vignettes, and they're basically just situations of certain people.\n",
      "After I do these circumstances, I'm going to ask you a couple questions.\n",
      "It's going to get a little bit tedious, because they're the same questions for each scenario, but it should be very easy.\n",
      "I'm going to start with this first scenario, and then I'm going to ask you a couple questions about it.\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He's worried he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in any other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized, but is usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "The first question is should this person try and change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "No, I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you classify this more as like clutter problems or is this a full blown hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Oh, it's definitely not a full blown hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Just more clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think this behavior is similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Similar.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:39:13]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But it's not something that's overwhelming?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Thank you.\n",
      "Yeah, that was a great question.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "So the next question that we wanted to talk with you about was the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas, substantially compromising their intended use.\n",
      "So we’re curious about how you make the determination of how much stuff is too much, especially with things like home size and other people in the home may affect the degree of clutter in the space.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Here, the distinction is really whether or not the person can carry out the normal activities of daily living in that space.\n",
      "And that’s a clinical judgement about the extent to which the clutter prevents them from being able to do those things.\n",
      "So it is a clinical judgement and what the way I look at it, is the extent to which you can actually do the things you need to do in the house.\n",
      "So can you sit in a chair?\n",
      "Can you sleep in your bed?\n",
      "Can you eat a meal at a table?\n",
      "Can you cook in the kitchen?\n",
      "Can you open the door to you home to get out quickly if you need to?\n",
      "Is there enough space for emergency personnel to get a gurney in if there’s a medical emergency?\n",
      "Can you safely go up and down the stairs?\n",
      "Those are, those are the kinds of questions that I use to make that determination.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "And is this, those questions that you ask, does that take into account a patient’s intended use of the space.\n",
      "For example, you know, if you don’t like to cook, how should you be using the kitchen?\n",
      "What is the appropriate use?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.\n",
      "And so if you have a room that’s designed as an office and it’s absolutely full but you don’t use it.\n",
      "You simply use it as a storage room, then that means the interpretations are a little bit different because that’s not a behavior that you’re planning to engage in or need to use.\n",
      "So it’s basically turning a room that’s designed for one purpose into another, and that purpose is storage.\n",
      "And having a storage room does not qualify as in this criteria.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "We also want to ask, for healthy individuals, there’s a degree of variance in the free space that they like in their homes.\n",
      "For example, some people might prefer to have a clear desk while others prefer to have things out and ready to use.\n",
      "Do you feel like hoarding disorder could just be an extension of this variance that surpasses socially acceptable thresholds?\n",
      "Interviewee: Absolutely.\n",
      "And I’ve been hoping that someone would take up that question at some point.\n",
      "I wish I had more time or I would.\n",
      "What is a preferred living space?\n",
      "Are there people who enjoy sort of cave-like spaces versus people who enjoy sort of open spaces and is that related to hoarding?\n",
      "I suspect that it is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. I've read Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five.\n",
      "And I'm working through the rest of them.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes, good, good.\n",
      "Well, I have a library of Vonnegut as well as considerable stuff on gays.\n",
      "And I have all my old yearbooks from high school and college.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Sounds-\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I taught a course called, the Political Ideas of Kurt Vonnegut.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's an interesting book.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "When I was teaching college back in the '70s.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You were teaching college?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You've had a rich history.\n",
      "A lot of these have primed you to see the value of items and keep them.\n",
      "And I hope that someone else finds the same value in these items because they're definitely [crosstalk 00:42:12].\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "Well, I do to because I don't think I've got a real plan for what happens to them when I'm not around.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, now that you have all this time, probably more so sequestered in your home than before, due to COVID, have you found that there's extra time to organize items?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Well, I've found more time to think about organizing them, yes.\n",
      "And the prospect of moving, as I said, I'm interested in donating, getting rid of a lot of stuff in order not to move it.\n",
      "But then, the donation and getting rid of, and selling things is, those are things that entail a lot of work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They do require [crosstalk 00:43:12].\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "And time and figuring out social distancing and what have you as well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you found that being in your home more so than before, if that's the case, has affected your sense of connectedness or your attachment to the items you have?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Possibly.\n",
      "Since I'm seeing the items I have every day, it's like well, what are they for?\n",
      "What use are they?\n",
      "I don't think of myself as the classic hoarder they mention in the movie, where the guy's got stacks of newspapers, and he can't find the stove, stuff like that.\n",
      "But I do have a lot of stuff.\n",
      "And that's a concern because I don't need access to that stuff.\n",
      "Or a need to organize and know what that stuff is, like I started, added a program to my phone, where I can scan the bar codes on the books in my library.\n",
      "And so I've done that for all of the books in my Rousseau library that bar codes.\n",
      "But I've got the older books that didn't have bar codes.\n",
      "Some of them are as old as 18th century, 19th century publications.\n",
      "And 20th century.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You seem to [crosstalk 00:45:25]\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "So those I have to enter in by hand.\n",
      "And that's work.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "No. No. No. When I lived in south Florida, we were having a hurricane, and it was my first hurricane that I was going to go through.\n",
      "And, I packed my car with so many things, that all the things that you would call the precious things.\n",
      "I guess, I would say the first thing, thinking back on that.\n",
      "The first thing I packed were all the family photographs.\n",
      "So that's the most precious.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it seems like for you, sentimentality and especially remembering people that you love and things that they've done for you that they convey that they love you.\n",
      "Those are what's important?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Huge.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "That's huge for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And, I guess that would then lead me to think that if you had to choose between the items, the ones that you would keep would be the ones that mean the most to you or remind you of those that you love most?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "... And you've already kind of touched on this element of hoarding disorder, but differentiating hoarding from collecting, what would you describe hoarding disorder as in comparison to collecting?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I think hoarding disorder is you just have too much.\n",
      "It's the quantity of what you have that you don't necessarily have a good place for.\n",
      "Like I don't know how I want to describe this.\n",
      "Like if you have a collection, even though I don't collect things, one thing that I have that is a collection is teapots.\n",
      "And it's just that I've ended up with them from different family members, even though I never considered myself a teapot collector.\n",
      "But, I have a place for them.\n",
      "They're organized and displayed properly for a collection.\n",
      "So, that's how I think of a collection.\n",
      "... Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that does make sense.\n",
      "You mentioned that quantity is the biggest thing that tells you that someone has hoarding disorder.\n",
      "How do you define too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "... Well, it clutters up everything.\n",
      "How do you define that someone has too much stuff?\n",
      "The closets are full, the shelves are full.\n",
      "It overflows, it's the overflow of things into places where they don't belong.\n",
      "And, how many of an item do you really need?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like shirts and shoes that you mentioned earlier.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "And like when my pen drawer got full, I stopped taking pens that they're handing out to you all over the place.\n",
      "I thought, \"No, I can't have anymore of those, because my pen drawer is full.\"\n",
      "So it would be just one more thing.\n",
      "I mean I don't even need all the pens that I have.\n",
      "It took the pen drawer filling up for me to know that, \"Okay, you've got too many pens.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it was that physical marker of it not fitting in the space that it was allotted before?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, I was going to say the anxiety there was really about somebody else coming into my house to help me, quote-unquote.\n",
      "I just felt like nobody would understand the process I need to go through and I certainly wouldn't want to do this with some professional, or a friend even.\n",
      "It's too vulnerable of a situation.\n",
      "Yeah, I really want to be hidden in my issues.\n",
      "I don't want to share them with others.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It seems like you're fairly open about discussing them.\n",
      "It would be, is it the formal process of having to justify why keeping something that is the bothersome portion of it?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, and yet I don't ... I certainly don't like being judged by people, and I don't like the feeling of being misunderstood, which is being judged, basically.\n",
      "I don't want to have to explain myself to somebody unless I want to, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Having somebody come into my house to tell me how to get rid of things is already them judging me, and then I would have to explain, I guess, why I'm keeping something.\n",
      "Yeah, it's just too much.\n",
      "Every little thing, every little thing, has a reason.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do your family and your friends feel about the collecting of items in your home space?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "None of my friends have told me a negative feeling.\n",
      "It doesn't mean I don't think some of them have a negative judgment, but generally I don't host people at my house, and you know, I like my friends.\n",
      "I like people, and I go to their homes, or now we meet outside, six feet apart, but I am known by my friends that I don't invite people over to my house, and if we're hanging out in my yard for some reason, which happens now and then, I clean my bathroom like everybody would clean their bathroom, but I'm uncomfortable that they would come in, walk through my entry room to the restroom, and make a judgment of what they see.\n",
      "Nobody's going to come back out and say, \"Participant 28, why do you have all that stuff on your desk,\" or, \"what is all that?\n",
      "Oh my god, that's a lot of stuff.\"\n",
      "Nobody says negative things to me, but I believe that they would tell you confidentially that Participant 28 has a problem.\n",
      "Then I have other friends who say, \"Participant 28, you're an artist.\n",
      "Give yourself a break.\n",
      "It's okay.\"\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "\"It's not like you're collecting feces.\"\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I like that that's the example that keeps coming up.\n",
      "034\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, that was all the listing prompts that I have for you.\n",
      "And so this next interview section that we'll be moving into is more of question, answer.\n",
      "So the first thing I'd like you to describe to me is your problems with clutter and how long this has been going on.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I would just say that I keep perhaps more stuff that I need to in terms of thinking of documentation.\n",
      "I was a records manager professionally and worked in a court clerk's office managing court case records and leading a process that went from paper files to electronic files, saving huge amounts of space and increasing convenience and the speeding of the judicial process in the process.\n",
      "Anyway, so I developed habits of keeping stuff in case you need it.\n",
      "And that makes it harder to toss things out because it's a question of in case you need it, you have it.\n",
      "But again, that's just one way of thinking about it.\n",
      "You can rearrange your thinking to, in case I need these books, I have them, but as I get older, I'm going to have the opportunity to use them less and less.\n",
      "So putting them in other people's hands makes better use of them.\n",
      "And there are ways to donate or sell books, which I don't know a good by product of this study could be a handbook of, How to Get Rid of Stuff You've Got, for some in the process.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, the concern that you mentioned about thinking about, not necessarily being frustrated, but that concern that I have items that other people can use, that is really common it seems, as well as that belief that well, you would also be a great person for that use to go to as well.\n",
      "So there's kind of like those two thoughts in contrast.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, which is hard to deal with and probably leads to the accumulation of a lot of these books, which it sounds like you probably have on a lot of interesting and useful topics.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I have three or four themes of books that... I will always buy something if I see it that's new in that area.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do your problems-\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "And I have a Barnes and Noble account.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do your problems mostly with clutter center around keeping books?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Well, I'd say it's largely books and documents.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how severe would you say that this behavior is now, meaning can you walk through your spaces where you save items?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes, I can.\n",
      "There's a few narrow spots because of overflow.\n",
      "But yeah, I have a closet that needs cleaning out.\n",
      "I can't see the floor yet at the moment.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any other areas or is it particularly that closet?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "That closet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And did you mention that you live alone?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes. That's right.\n",
      "But we have it in abundance if we're [inaudible 00:36:49] spending our time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I want to talk to you more about how quarantine and COVID have impacted your views of your items and starting to maybe get, work through organizing and discarding.\n",
      "First I want to ask you, does your behavior of collecting items and not really discarding, does that upset you at all or does it get in the way of every day life?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "It does to some degree because it limits my mobility.\n",
      "It's a major thing to move my library.\n",
      "I now have three bedrooms of bedroom furniture.\n",
      "So I'll have to think in terms of a sale or yard sale or whatever before I move next, which I think, what I'm trying to do the next couple of months.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "You'll have your work cut out for you.\n",
      "Has your keeping items ever gotten in the way of romantic or family relationships?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "That's often another reason that people will list is, whenever they talk about why keeping items might be distressing is, they will mention the mobility concern as well as who will clean it up after they're gone, potentially.\n",
      "But then also, a lot of people are distressed because they're external pressure is from other people asking them, why do you do this or wanting them to get rid of items.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Or wanting to know, do you have a plan for when you're gone?\n",
      "I feel unprepared.\n",
      "Like I was working on my doctoral dissertation forever.\n",
      "I never did finish it because, it was on Jacque Rousseau, 18th century Swiss philosopher of some note.\n",
      "So I have a library that is [inaudible 00:39:12] for books by or about Rousseau and his philosophy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You kind of [crosstalk 00:39:22]-\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I haven't found a scholar or university or something to see if they would like to be in line to either inherit or purchase this library for students and scholars to use.\n",
      "I've got all his works in French and English and most of the major secondary works and works about him since the '60s.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You have so many items that are so valuable and such a diverse...\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yeah, I'm a specialist.\n",
      "It's a specialty kind of library.\n",
      "I have a couple of autographed books like one by Kurt Vonnegut.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Which one?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Oh dear, which one is it?\n",
      "I have his works.\n",
      "I'm from Indianapolis.\n",
      "And that was his hometown as well.\n",
      "In fact, I lived about six blocks from his house, but some years after he lived there.\n",
      "And I didn't realize it at the time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's so interesting.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I'm going to check which book it is.\n",
      "I'm just having a brain fart [inaudible 00:40:58].\n",
      "Hocus Pocus.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I haven't read that one.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "You haven't read that one?\n",
      "And then a box full of glasses, reading glasses.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's messy but not dirty.\n",
      "It's cluttered but intriguing, and some people would just see the mess, but I like seeing the miscellaneous interesting things interspersed among the things I need to do.\n",
      "Is this too much detail?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, it's really helpful to hear what your space looks like, and it sounds like for you the items, it's not that the clutter is preventing you from walking around or moving around, or that the clutter is overwhelming.\n",
      "In fact, using the word clutter almost seems inappropriate in a way, because it seems like these are tools or supplies for you that you keep in select areas and are aware of, and some of them are there for use, and some of them are there, it seems, because they're aesthetically appealing, like you had mentioned earlier on.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But the issue comes when the piles stay for too long, and they then inhibit me from starting the next creative project, and so then I need to put everything away, and that means I need a place to store it, so then I'm storing all of this stuff that, yeah, Participant 28 made greeting cards during shelter in place, and they're about to all be put away, and I've given away a lot, and I've mailed a lot, and I've even given some to some businesses I know of and they're selling a few, but I've got probably 100 left and it's time to put them away because I don't feel like making them anymore, so I need to put them away sometime, and it's not like I'm going to throw them away, so they will be added to boxes of the last projects, and the last one before that, and the ones before that, for in case I want to do them again.\n",
      "And I haven't done some projects for years, and I have boxes of them.\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Where do you store these boxes?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Well, I have this wonderful large garage that I'm grateful for almost every day, and when we first built it, it was a two car garage, and then it became a one car garage because my husband has wind surfing equipment, and he has sporting stuff that he saves, and then slowly but surely I have taken over half of the garage is my stuff, and I have a workspace in there because I also make jewelry, and I do welding, and then I used to work in a school based mental health program doing the arts and crafts, so I have boxes of options for running craft projects, like therapeutic craft projects, with kids.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, right, right.\n",
      "Ok, so now we’re going to get into some questions that are more focused on your kind of knowledge based about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So, if we were to talk really broadly, what, and you kind of started to do this with the list already, but just to talk in a more freeform way.\n",
      "For you, what are the most salient features of hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Particularly focusing on the difference between maybe what would be considered normal saving behavior or collecting and what constitutes hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Um, I guess a salient feature is really that there is a remarkable breadth in the symptom patterns and the rationale for saving.\n",
      "Which leads me to think that that much variability in the patient population, one starts to try figure out whether there is a something more basic going on that can manifest in a wide variety of ways that the source of the problem is far more fundamental.\n",
      "And I think that there are probably two places to look for that.\n",
      "One is in the animal literature on hoarding because there is an animal literature and that, uh, those researchers can actually take the brains apart of the animals and look at what’s going on, uh, and try to figure out the extent to which the human brain has elements that are related to whatever drives the hoarding.\n",
      "This is probably brain stem level problem, not hyper-cognitive functioning.\n",
      "Interviewer: Hmm\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, and so you think about birds that nest, squirrels that, uh, they’re scatter hoarders and larder hoarders.\n",
      "I find that a really interesting thing, and if I were to go back and start over in my, you know, early twenties, I might well go down that path.\n",
      "Um, the other aspect of hoarding that catches my attention is there, uh, is an awful lot of emotion that people attach, emotion and identity meaning if you will, that people attach to objects that seems to distinguish people who hoard from people who treat objects in a more ordinary fashion.\n",
      "We’re all capable of being attached to objects so that’s not the issue.\n",
      "Um, it’s the degree of attachment and the kinds of things that people attach the emotions to if you will.\n",
      "So, sometimes they’ll say stuff that the rest of us just look at and go “what in the world?” [laugh]\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. And if you were to kind of picture a typical hoarding patient, or a typical patient with this disorder, what do they look like?\n",
      "What are the demographics like?\n",
      "Interviewee: Demographics for serious hoarding behavior, uh, someone who is in their fifties, mid- to late- fifties.\n",
      "It appears to be, although studies differ, in general, it appears that it is equally prevalent in men and women.\n",
      "In terms of appearance, there is very little that you can tell by looking at someone, except in some cases in severe hoarding cases there’s some dishevelment on part of the hoarding client, but that’s not the case with the majority of them but occasionally you see that.\n",
      "Um, what else?\n",
      "Interviewer: Some factors, you know, like socioeconomic status, race or religion, or regional – rural/urban.\n",
      "Something like that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, not much difference for rural/urban.\n",
      "Some differences in socioeconomic status.\n",
      "It is associated with lower levels of socioeconomic status, although the association is not a perfect correlation.\n",
      "So we see that it is a cause of spectrum, but it is more frequent in people who have, typically have more financial difficulties than people who don’t.\n",
      "They often don’t pay their taxes for a while in part of the disorganization.\n",
      "Um, oh gosh, what else?\n",
      "Interviewer: Race and ethnicity?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t think… there’s not much evidence out there about race and ethnicity.\n",
      "What we do see in some cases that it is, it appears to be as prevalent in African American groups as in Caucasian groups and perhaps maybe even more so.\n",
      "And other than that, there’s not a lot of evidence.\n",
      "There’s evidence that it’s sort of broad culturally.\n",
      "You see this in every culture.\n",
      "Not many studies have been done in different cultures outside of the Western world, but there are evidences of this in the East.\n",
      "In China, Japan, for instance, there appears to be similar prevalence rates, but beyond that, not much culturally or at least internationally.\n",
      "For a while, the living room, the one area of the house that I could let people into and not be embarrassed by clutter, I had boxes that I had not unpacked.\n",
      "Stuff that sat there for a month, and then I guess, two weeks ago, I finally went, enough, this is ridiculous, unpack everything, recycle, flatten the boxes out, put them out in the recycle bin, et cetera, et cetera, and dealt with it.\n",
      "I'm going, yeah, yay, you did something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You went through a period with COVID where, when there were all the shortages, you decided that it was time to stock up.\n",
      "Then you stocked up and found that you didn't necessarily need all the stuff you'd stocked up on, and it was just piling up and building up around your house.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Then there were unrelated, the COVID just impulse buying.\n",
      "Oh, this looks cool.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I can relate to that.\n",
      "When you're stuck at home all day, you don't have that much to do, it can be easy to creep back on Amazon.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like you have been able to discard anything during this period, or do you feel like your getting rid of stuff-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "No. In fact, I've been beating myself up about that, that it's like, Participant 035, there's just no excuse for all the mess you've got around here, because you've got the time, you've got the physical ability to deal with it, and you're not.\n",
      "That frustrates me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's been easy to be hard on yourself about that as well.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The only positive thing is usually when I'm beating myself up about something, I overeat.\n",
      "I haven't been doing that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good for you.\n",
      "That is a positive.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I didn't pick up the COVID 15.\n",
      "Woo.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Amazing.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's an evolution for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like COVID has impacted your depression or your mental health more broadly?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah, because again, it's given me more unstructured time.\n",
      "I recognize that, and back in, I guess it was late April or early May, a call went out for contract employees to be hired as contact tracers.\n",
      "Since I'm an RN, I was a pretty desirable commodity, and went to work as a contact tracer, and started in mid-May.\n",
      "No, it was second week in May, I guess it was, for the county.\n",
      "It was four 12s and three 12s, and I'm going, I'm 71, and this is ... I can deal with this.\n",
      "This is great.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like your depression and your clutter are causing each other.\n",
      "It sounds like on the one hand, you see depression as being the reason you're so cluttered, but on the other hand, the clutter is making your depression worse, because you're so hard on yourself about your inability to solve the problem of the clutter.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like all that has gotten worse with COVID.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It kind of has.\n",
      "It's given me more time to take stock and I've made a few positive moves, but there's a whole lot more I can do.\n",
      "I'm at a point where okay, this has got to stop.\n",
      "This is ridiculous.\n",
      "I can't turn into this, the weird woman who lives in that house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Everything looks great on the outside, but as soon as you open that door, man, it's scary.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you're really ...\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I feel like okay, just keep going, Participant 035, you can get this sorted out.\n",
      "Okay, quit making excuses.\n",
      "Anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It almost sounds like-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I'll plan things to make myself, to force me to take some action, like my son's coming over on Friday to deal with my smoke alarms.\n",
      "I know I've got to have stuff more cleaned up, so that he can get into all the rooms to change everything out.\n",
      "It's Tuesday, and this morning, I made a small start with pulling clothes, basically, with the clothes, I've got clothes in just about every closet in the house.\n",
      "Right now, the closets are bursting at the seams.\n",
      "I must get rid of that.\n",
      "I've started piling up clothes, and I've just made two piles, things that can go to ...\n",
      "It's a women's, for women's shelter, and things that can go to Goodwill, and forget about the consignment stuff, because I don't think people are out shopping.\n",
      "I've started that out, so that I can get clothes off the clean and dry rack and into closets, and then deal with all the clothes that are sitting out here and there and everywhere.\n",
      "Anyway.\n",
      "That's ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "You create reasons for yourself to need to get organized, and that's what helps motivate you and push you forward.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I try and ignore the fact that for me, Participant 035, you're worth doing this just for yourself to make you more comfortable.\n",
      "I have to have an external pusher to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For the last-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "That's the way I am.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I feel like there must be something I'm missing here that I would really struggle to lose.\n",
      "That's a really good question and that's the question I need to measure things by.\n",
      "I'm sure you've heard of Marie Kondo, or whatever, and does this thing give me joy?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "A friend of mine teaches that class at the college here, and I've never taken it because I just do not, I keep things that don't necessarily give me joy, and I have a reason for keeping them, like they might be useful, so I totally poo-poo that whole philosophy, but the question whether this item would cause me distress if I had to get rid of it now is interesting, because there's a whole lot of stuff here that would not cause me distress if I had to, but it makes me happy that I don't have to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "But maybe I should use that as a measure.\n",
      "Like, \"Why are you actually keeping this?\" I can't answer that really well.\n",
      "There's this interesting shaped box here that a friend gave me because she knows I like boxes.\n",
      "God, like, I've got a lot of boxes.\n",
      "I don't need this box.\n",
      "It's not going to hurt me to get rid of it.\n",
      "I'm happy I don't have to but it could go into my box of things to give away.\n",
      "Does that make any sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So, what would happen if you lost an item that had deep sentimental meaning that is not replaceable that you don't feel okay with parting with?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "What would happen?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, do you-\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Like, to me psychologically?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "However you interpret that, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, I would feel resentful that obviously someone else is making that choice for me, and understanding that there's real value to that item, and making me get rid of it.\n",
      "That is not right.\n",
      "Resentful.\n",
      "And then it's gone, and resentment doesn't get you anywhere, I would have to work on kind of a slump, like a depression about it.\n",
      "I'd have to say goodbye, and you know, it's actually bringing tears to my eyes.\n",
      "Yeah, it would be really a process to get through, and I'd probably judge myself a lot about it, then I'd just like, \"You've got to just work through this and have your cry and come back around and cry some more.\"\n",
      "And I'd probably start collecting again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Sounds like there's definitely, it seems to tie back into the feeling of control you mentioned, when we were making some lists over, like these are your items to decide about, and inviting someone else into your home or having that item taken from you is an example of that control either being taken away, or trust of another individual being diminished.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And then can I get a first and last name.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, Participant 32, K-A-T-H-Y Johnson, J-O-H-N-S-O-N.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And then an email address?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Did you say email address?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes ma'am.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Okay, let me spell it to you.\n",
      "It is K-A-T-R-I-N-A-J-E-A-N-A@gmail.com and so, it's Katrina Jeana, Jean being my middle name, J-E-A-N.\n",
      "Katrinajeana@gmail.com.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), got it.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then a permanent mailing address?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, 23173 Butterfield, one word, Butterfield Trail, which they spell T-R-L, Bend, B-E-N-D, Oregon 97702.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oregon 97702, okay.\n",
      "So, 23173 Butterfield Trail Bend, Oregon 97702.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yep, got it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then is this a good phone number to reach you?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yep, it's my only one.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, great.\n",
      "Okay, so that's all I have.\n",
      "Thank you for taking the time out of your day to talk with me.\n",
      "We really appreciate it.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, you're so welcome.\n",
      "My pleasure and hopefully it's going to be helpful somehow.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, for sure, definitely.\n",
      "Okay, thank you.\n",
      "Have a good day.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Thanks so much.\n",
      "You too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Take care.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you determine what is then worth keeping versus throwing away for you?\n",
      "How do you determine what you're going to throw away or donate?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Well, just my own judgment, I guess.\n",
      "Does it have lasting value?\n",
      "Is it a contract that's expired, a lease that's no longer applicable because I don't live there anymore?\n",
      "But I carried a hard copy of the lease.\n",
      "Also, one issue is, do I have a reliable electronic copy and access to that copy of important documents or can I create images, make electronic copies and keep them in the computer and toss the paper?\n",
      "That's what I did professionally in the superior court here, was to get the records from paper into computers.\n",
      "So instead of looking for a file, which would be an object of documents bound together that relate to a case that somebody's got in their possession, the judge, the defense attorney, the prosecuting attorney, someone who checked it out to look up something.\n",
      "We created a system where everyone could access the documents electronically because we scanned paper into images and then started electronic filing.\n",
      "So documents would never exist in paper form.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's an awesome thing to do.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And we got an award from Kennedy School of Government for innovation in American government.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sounds like it was well deserved.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes, it was.\n",
      "No, it took about 20 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like you're a very practical person and that you keep items that have value to you, but you're also looking for ways to maybe trim down, keeping paper copies of records or, like you don't keep every note sent to you.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:24:45]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So what items or if you have a specific item, is most valuable to you?\n",
      "And why is it valuable?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "What items are most valuable?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "I have an oil painting that a friend, who's since died, made that needs to go to a museum eventually.\n",
      "That's something that I would grab, say if there were a fire.\n",
      "There's a piece of art that shows two bears, one older and one younger lying in bed.\n",
      "And it says, \"Ask Dad.\n",
      "He knows.\"\n",
      "And that was done by a friend who's also, who has passed away.\n",
      "And so I use that as my Facebook logo and other things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "He was really cool.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "And so I'd want to grab that, my autograph by Divine, which I got on my 36th birthday.\n",
      "Just items like that come to mind.\n",
      "I guess the computer.\n",
      "Hopefully, that's all backed up into the cloud.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So no need for the physical actual existence of it.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "P1: Okay, kind of inline with that we’ve we were wondering how do you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm hm, yeah that’s an interesting question, I would define insight as what is this person aware of um that discomfort or the suffering even the whole situation is is creating for them.\n",
      "Yeah I’d say it's if they if one person if someone can realize they actually are suffering because they can't sleep in their bed, and they will feel bad about this then this is this is someone who is good insight, and if someone is like is almost like comfortable in their cocoon and feel like there’s nothing too serious about this um and they are not aware of their thought process or emotions, yeah almost like normal cluttered life, like this is someone I would have consider low insight.\n",
      "P1: Yeah so its kind of related to the their understanding of the consequences of their actions.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, or also the the actual day to day experience, moment to moment experience of living with clutter.\n",
      "P1: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "P1: So in the literature there’s been kind of a break down of the concept of insight is a various constructs that uh might be contributing to what is seen as variation and insight for people with hoarding disorder so-\n",
      "Interviewee: hmm.\n",
      "P1: Some of theses, were just going to be wondering from you are any of theses things more prevalent or more problematic in your work?\n",
      "So theses have included things like defensiveness, um the conflict of anosognosia or lack of ability to perceive your illness that something’s wrong, over valuation so beliefs about the values of items that are um abnormal and indifference.\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm what’s the last one?\n",
      "P1: Indifference.\n",
      "Interviewee: Indifference, hm hm and the question was what?\n",
      "(laughing)\n",
      "P1: Uh no no problem we were just wondering are, if have you seen theses, are any of them more prevalent or problematic?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhuh, huh, I would imagine there is um, I would imagine I am only seeing um a more mild version of there because if people come for treatments they they they are like a self selected sample already and, but I do I did have heard people describe before like years and years ago they were in the stage where they don’t see it as a problem at all kind of like indifference in the situation that you mentioned yeah so I I’ve heard people describing their previous state more close to what you are describing but because they are here for treatment, they are they’ve overcome a lot of these not that they are totally aware of it all the time.\n",
      "P1: Okay so in the practice that you have now, in the patients that you see, you don’t see much defensiveness or anosognosia, or even the overvalued ideation, you don’t see those as much?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well there, I I see these um but but they would be defensive sometimes but its its like um its like these are okay to communicate in therapy, and like I say they are defensive but but they are not um they are open to to different um um different perspectives, and um so when you are when you are saying theses things um different categories I was imagining the worst case of theses things so yeah, so thank you for reminding me that in my practice I do see people sometimes they would have things coming up yeah.\n",
      "P1: Okay\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "It's because I think of the lack of socializing that I can do now, some of these objects just feel more like familiar old friends and so they are there instead of... I mean they kind of replace the socializing in a sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely, mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And has the pandemic affected your attempts to declutter?\n",
      "Have you been spending more time trying to get organized?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Hmm, I think I've had more time to get organized.\n",
      "Not saying that I've spent a whole lot more time.\n",
      "But yes, I've spent some more time organizing, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And these are more about your general functioning but has the pandemic impacted your overall physical health?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it affected your overall mental health or wellbeing?\n",
      "Like has the lack of socialization taken a toll mentally or anything?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, I think a little bit it's taken a mental toll, the lack of social times, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And has the pandemic affected you or your family financially?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Hmm...\n",
      "Not me so much and I don't really know about my family.\n",
      "Hmm, I think the answer's no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how have you been coping with this pandemic?\n",
      "Have you had any specific techniques or things that you do to help you find comfort or ease?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Well yes, I talk to friends and family and so having conversations about it is somewhat soothing although it depends on who I talk to because a couple of my three sisters I disagree with very, very much about their beliefs about this COVID thing and so...\n",
      "Now I forget what the question was.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How have you been coping or what specific techniques?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, copying yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, so conversations with...\n",
      "Yeah, with my friends primarily.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And if you were to pick, would you say that you find more comfort in your objects or your conversations with your friends?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Conversations with friends.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you sought any treatment, resources, or some other kind of professional support during COVID-19?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Hmm, I'm trying to remember.\n",
      "I've gone... I know I've gone to counselors and a couple of body work type of people, physical therapists, and acupuncturists and that kind of thing for some things.\n",
      "But I'm trying to remember though before... I think it was before COVID.\n",
      "No, I've gone to see a physical therapist.\n",
      "This was a thing that...\n",
      "Whatever, just from my moving and all that, I sprained my back and so I needed some help with that.\n",
      "But as far as psychological sort of counseling or whatever, no, I haven't done that since COVID started.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And has COVID affected your motivation to seek help for your hoarding behavior specifically?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Sounds like, yeah, you've had a lot of different exposure to areas where it might come up in your life.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I also live in rural Montana.\n",
      "There are yards in my neighborhood and beyond of people who I could label as hoarders because I can drive past their yard or see garbage stacked up around their house, things like that, and then I go, \"Oh, good, I'm not a bad hoarder compared to them.\"\n",
      "But it's not like I live in a nice neighborhood where you don't have as many opportunities to see hoarding.\n",
      "We see it here.\n",
      "People save things.\n",
      "Not everybody, but here and there, you can see it more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "I don't know, I haven't lived in the city for a long time.\n",
      "Maybe it's not more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I wonder.\n",
      "I wouldn't necessarily know how you'd tell know, if you can't see someone's yard or their space as openly.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, when I was growing up, my dad is a hoarder but inside the house.\n",
      "Nobody could tell by looking at the house, you know, and that's my impression of my neighborhood where I grew up.\n",
      "You couldn't tell if anyone was a hoarder by looking because everybody took care of the outside of their house to some degree so that they wouldn't stick out too much, I guess.\n",
      "Yeah, anyways.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is interesting.\n",
      "Let me look through and see.\n",
      "We've talked about a lot of different things, and it's a lot easier to have these interviews and have them be more of a discussion where we kind of go from idea to idea, but then I have to go back and check and make sure we've covered most of our bases.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's a job for you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And I think the only questions I'm really left with us what items in your house do you consider to be the most valuable, and what do you think would happen if you were to lose or have to discard these items?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Hm. That may be the most thought provoking thing you've asked me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I had to end with a big one.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I guess the things that are not actually replaceable that elicit memories certainly are the most valuable, I think.\n",
      "I mean, I'm looking around in my living room and dining room kitchen here, and everything is replaceable other than my original drawings which, I'm kind of tired of them right now.\n",
      "But when I think of my garage, where I have boxes of driftwood from different trips to the ocean, I mean, that just sounds crazy.\n",
      "That would be so sad to lose those.\n",
      "They have no monetary value whatsoever.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, it's been pretty apparent that monetary value, that's the least important characteristic.\n",
      "Interviewee: I can I’m under the impression that more often the the um son or the daughters, the children, yeah they younger generation.\n",
      "P3: Mhm mhm okay, um and what about kind of employees of institutions or um state employees, such as social workers, police officers or things like homeowners associations are they ever involved, and if so how frequently or in what capacity?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah those those organizations are sometimes involved too, so there were there are people who are seeking treatment because their their building manager and also social worker in the building, if they live in senior housing um realize the problem and then they get involved, yeah.\n",
      "P3: Okay.\n",
      "P1: Okay.\n",
      "P3: Um yeah\n",
      "P1: Yeah so uh were just about at the end of the interview, the last question that we really wanted to ask you was what do you think are the biggest things that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm I think there are so many big things we still don’t know about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "I’m um (laughing) many many many questions are like like in my head jumping up and saying ‘pick me pick me’.\n",
      "P3: (laughing) You don’t have to pick one, you can make a list if you want.\n",
      "Interviewee: So I I I find it very interesting that uh because hoarding disorder started when say when people were in their childhood, so I wonder I think this is so understudied, because we are now focusing on the already very sick ones, which are the older ones but we know the behavior starts so early on, what’s going on and how do they continue?\n",
      "Like is it simply that after they leave home then they don’t have parents um picking up things or or controlling them so they start to get this disorder?\n",
      "Or maybe there are some other things that make this behavior worse or continues some?\n",
      "Or does it just disappear um say in their mid-life and they just stop hoarding?\n",
      "I just feel like there is it’s a mystery how what what happens to these younger, or even kids yeah so this is one reason, and the other reason is related to one of questions you asked we we are very much focused on on the more um the more cognitive components or how people think how people with hoarding problems think and therefore they have theses behaviors but what about something more underlying?\n",
      "Like there is research starting to look at um cells and um looking at emotional tolerance and I think that these are all still these are all very important to continue to look at into the more deeper roots of the problem.\n",
      "Yeah and\n",
      "P3: Okay\n",
      "Interviewee: Of course we’ve all heard the INAUDIBLE (1:06:44)\n",
      "P3: INAUDIBLE (1:06:46)\n",
      "Interviewee: Sorry\n",
      "P3: No no that’s a great answer.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah and I I said, they last thing was that of course there’s heritability but we don’t know which genes yet, but that’s obviously more up there and worth digging into.\n",
      "P3: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so many (laughing).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it ever before maybe gotten in the way of something you really wanted to do, like have a new friend over or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "One of the organizations that I'm active in was having a volunteer appreciation party, and it would have been appropriate for me to host it, but I knew that there was no way that that I was ready for that.\n",
      "So I asked someone else to host it.\n",
      "It doesn't have serious affects on my day to day life.\n",
      "It's just kind of always there.\n",
      "It's always this thing hanging over me that I really need to sit down and go through all of this stuff, and clean out that room, and organize things.\n",
      "But there's always some other, more pressing thing that needs to be done, and it's easy to just put it off.\n",
      "I think procrastination, I think that's something, at the very beginning when you're having the bullet list, I think procrastination is a big... I tend to procrastinate, and I think that's a big contributor to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know you said that your husband, who you live with, is quite understanding, and that there was a time in which it did cause some conflicts with your mom, but other than that, have you every experienced any sorts of impact of the clutter problems on your romantic relationships or your family relationships, other than the ones you've already told me?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "No, I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Back to your husband, you said that he's very understanding of it.\n",
      "So what does that look like for you?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "It look likes, he's not...\n",
      "He's a little bit sloppy.\n",
      "He doesn't always put everything away, but I think he, but he's not as bad as I am, and I think he tolerates it because, to him, the benefits outweigh the irritation or whatever.\n",
      "We have a good relationship.\n",
      "We're older, but we've only been married like 22 years, this year.\n",
      "I think he would be happy if I cleaned everything up, but as long as... I think he's able to tolerate it because he's basically happy otherwise, I think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about any sorts of impacts on your work or your career?\n",
      "Has there ever been anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I don't think it ever effected my work.\n",
      "I've been retired for about 10 years, but I don't think, I wouldn't say that it ever effected work.\n",
      "I always had a messy desk at work, but it wasn't really that much worse than a lot of people's.\n",
      "There's always a couple people that have, always, absolutely neat desk.\n",
      "And that was never me, but it was never really a problem.\n",
      "It never effected my work, I don't think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You would ideally though like to change your behavior, if not because it's impacted any relationships, but mostly just like for personal reasons, you feel personally motivated to change it?\n",
      "Interviewer: And kind of maybe to go along with that idea: when you meet a patient who is alleged to have very low insight, how do you help that patient try to gain insight or what do you say to them to help them to understand what’s going on with their behavior as being problematic?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well largely I approach it using a motivational interviewing approach; and the idea there is to begin where the patient is.\n",
      "So what I wanna do is, I wanna find out what kind of value the person puts on their thing.\n",
      "So I want to know what they have collected, and I want them to tell me what these things mean to them, and I want to try to appreciate it in the same way they do.\n",
      "So that what I’m doing is I’m trying to put myself in their shoes and see how this object can be valuable.\n",
      "And, in that way, begin to help them figure out how to evaluate the value of possession.\n",
      "One of the things that I have observed and it’s come out in a variety of ways and it just hits it out in some of the data that I’ve got is that when people with hoarding disorder acquire something, it goes into the home and then it is untouched after that.\n",
      "There is little or no interaction with possessions once they come into the home.\n",
      "And I think this is part of the key to understanding the disorder.\n",
      "That for most of us, we process our possessions when they come into the home, we interact with them, and that interaction with our objects leads us to figure out how valuable they are.\n",
      "But for people with hoarding disorder, they establish that value in the acquisition and once it comes into the home, the there’s no processing that goes on with that object so there is no reevaluation of its value.\n",
      "And so what I want to do is I want to start asking them about this possession that’s in front of them and what it means to them.\n",
      "And so I’m not trying to get them to throw this possession away, my purpose is in understanding the value of possessions and not them making a decision about whether to throw it away or not.\n",
      "And so in that way, the motivation here is sort of down the road.\n",
      "The real purpose here is to get them to start look at and evaluating the possession and then get to the point where we start talking about the benefits of having that possession and the costs of having that possession.\n",
      "And that…apply the life context to that decision: so what does it mean to have this possession?\n",
      "And what does this possession allow you to do?\n",
      "And what does this possession prevent you from doing?\n",
      "And in that way trying to establish the importance of change because what we want to focus on is the person’s values in life and what they value most.\n",
      "And what we find when we’ve done that in treatment, it’s part of our treatment package, is they value things like everybody else does, family, friends, religion, so forth.\n",
      "And yet the clutter that they have, the difficulty discarding, get in the way of achieving those values or goals.\n",
      "And so this processing, part of the processing is to understand how this thing is valuable to them and how it relates to their life goals and their life’s values.\n",
      "And so that’s the way I approach the motivation issue.\n",
      "032\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so as you know this study is investigating individuals attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So, the first question would be, what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "What term?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, like some people are okay with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Others prefer problems with clutter.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh. No, I'm not self-conscious about this kind of stuff.\n",
      "But yeah, I don't know if I really have hoarding disorder but I know I'm a clutter... I call myself a clutter bug.\n",
      "So yeah, whatever.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, great.\n",
      "So, now we are going to move into the section of the interview that's a little bit more conversational so it'll just be like a Q and A. I'll ask you a question and then you can answer in any way that you feel comfortable with answering.\n",
      "So, this first section is about behavior and treatment-seeking.\n",
      "So, could you please describe your clutter problems for me?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "One of my problems is that I don't seem to have a system for dealing with my mail.\n",
      "When I get mail, I'll open it, I'll read it and I'll set it down.\n",
      "I'll put the envelope in the recycle bag and then I'll put whatever the contents of the envelope was just in a pile.\n",
      "And so, sometimes...\n",
      "Yeah, so my correspondence or communications, the paper ones at least, are not well organized and sometimes I'll miss paying a bill or miss an appointment or something because I have buried the piece of paper that told me about it under other pieces of paper.\n",
      "Okay, I'm sorry, would you repeat the question again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, of course.\n",
      "Could you please describe your clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, it seems like every horizontal surface in my house has stuff on it and yeah, it's just clutter.\n",
      "Yeah, I just don't like that.\n",
      "I want open space but I need to... I want a place for everything to be or to give away or sell or whatever.\n",
      "So, yeah.\n",
      "My garage and various rooms in my house... I mean, mind you, I did just move in a couple months ago, so I'm still unpacking.\n",
      "But it's taking me a lot longer than I think it should.\n",
      "So, I keep finding other things to distract me and keep me from making the decisions about where to put things when I take them out of a box.\n",
      "So, life is not as smooth and comfortable and it's not organized very well as it should be or I want it to be.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, and how long has this been going on for?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I'm sure it's been going on for...\n",
      "Well, at least since 2001 so however many years that is.\n",
      "That's what?\n",
      "Let's see...\n",
      "It's 2020 now, so 19 years.\n",
      "Isn't that right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, and-\n",
      "P3: Okay, um if you were to, it sounds like you don’t it sounds like what you’re saying is that um in your practice a lot of times when patients see you they already have a degree of insight because they’re seeking treatment um-\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm\n",
      "P3: If you were to or if you have tried to explain hoarding disorder to a patient with low insight how would you explain it, how would you try to help a patient with hoarding disorder understand what hoarding disorder is and that they have it?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm, mhm uh you mean uh to someone who is seeking treatment or to someone who is maybe wondering if they have hoarding disorder or not?\n",
      "P3: Yeah to someone who is having a problem with insight into their hoarding disorder, to someone who’s maybe isn’t isn’t quite sure, or isn’t quite convinced they have this disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm, so I’m trying to imagine an example so maybe it would be someone who says ‘oh I just have too many things and my my daughter asked me come see you’ yeah there were cases like this too, yeah.\n",
      "So in this situation I would I would try to help them to become aware of how this um situation is and getting in the way of them living a better life condition they can have could have so I can ask them ‘oh um is there any inconvenience?’ ‘oh no’ they may be defensive and say ‘oh I’m very used to it I’m very comfortable with it there’s no problem about this’ and then um then so kind of like motivational interview and try to help them to see the discrepancy of what they could have to like to live um and in the current condition and, uh so um- sorry I’m blanking out on the original question.\n",
      "P3: Oh no no no, that was a great answer it sounds like if you’re saying you’re trying to help patients to understand their disorder you really focus on they way that the disorder is getting in the way of their life and try to highlight it and how their lives could be better/\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah yeah yeah.\n",
      "P3: Okay, and NAME (49:55)?\n",
      "P1: Yeah so the next thing that we want to do is talk about some of the explanations that patients with hoarding disorder have for their behavior, so for the next couple of questions we want you really to think about how your patients would respond to these questions.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "P1: For the first one uh and this is from the Brown assessment of belief scale, what do you think has caused you to have these behaviors, do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm and I you want me to imagine a patient, how a patient uh would-\n",
      "P1: How patients would-\n",
      "Interviewee: Answer the questions.\n",
      "P1: Respond yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm I think they would try to recall if they have any um relatives that may also have similar tendencies, and if they do they may say ‘yeah I believe is biological, its because my father for example also would have clutter INAUDIBLE (51:11)\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. I know you mentioned earlier that it's easy for you to throw away things like food wrappers and things that are considered, by most, to be trash so how do you know when it's time to throw something away or if something is trash.\n",
      "How do you know that?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Well with things like food wrappers, although then you get into sometimes something comes in a jar that looks like that could be useful.\n",
      "I think papers, sometimes it's just a matter of over time, you realize that after a certain amount of time that it has no values.\n",
      "Papers are not that hard for me to get rid of.\n",
      "What's hard is sitting down and looking at each one and making a decision.\n",
      "I think making a decision for me is the hard part.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What's kind of your process when you're making those decisions?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:19:00] ... anywhere else.\n",
      "I tend to keep things like bank statements.\n",
      "I think if I throw these out, I won't be able to get it again, and at one time I thought, I could digitize everything, but that's just an overwhelming project that never happened.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So definitely you can feel overwhelmed when it comes time to get rid of things or figure out when it's time to throw things away?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I think it's the idea of, asking this is kind of making me think, why is this such a problem, and I think it is the decision making, and there's always something else that needs to be done.\n",
      "I could sit down and go through all the papers on my dining table, and file things away or throw them away, but that requires making a lot of decisions, and I'm not real good at that, I don't think.\n",
      "It's hard for me to make quick decision.\n",
      "I have to kind of ruminate about everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Now I'm going to talk a little bit about how the clutter has kind of interfered, if at all, with your life.\n",
      "Do you think that it is an upsetting thing for you?\n",
      "And does it get in the way of your daily life tasks?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I don't think it gets in the way of my daily tasks, but I feel like, some of my friends, just kind of know how it is, and I think people that I don't know that well, I'd be really reluctant to have them come over to my house because I would feel like I would have to kind of, I call it bulldozing.\n",
      "Just kind of scoop everything up and put it in another room so that you have at least one or two rooms, public rooms that look reasonable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:21:38] ... once you bulldoze, then it's really hard to find things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Especially if you don't go through it right away.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "To make me feel at home?\n",
      "I don't think they are important to make me feel at home at all probably.\n",
      "I keep thinking that if the basement were to flood and I were to lose all of that stuff, I would be dead, but in my day-to-day life, I would not noticed it at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So wouldn't really...\n",
      "Makes sense.\n",
      "Any time you kind of lose possessions of any kind, you'd feel sad, but it wouldn't be detrimental to your overall life it sounds like.\n",
      "Out of those objects that you were talking about earlier or if any of that, you haven't mentioned yet or I missed, are any of those the most important to you or that you spend a lot of time with anything in particular?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, I don't, which is the ridiculous part around it all.\n",
      "I have it, but it mostly stays packed in boxes.\n",
      "Then the crafting stuff or whatever, sometimes I use some of it.\n",
      "I guess there's the thought that I might use most of it in the future, but in reality, very little gets done with it.\n",
      "It's not very important in my day-to-day life.\n",
      "I've kind of lost track of where I was going with the question, but...\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah, it's not really used on a daily basis.\n",
      "Or I don't spend time with it on a daily basis.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah, that answers my question.\n",
      "It was basically how much time you spend on those things.\n",
      "I think you've touched on this before, but just making sure that I have it right.\n",
      "Thinking about your possessions and what makes them valuable.\n",
      "It sounds like they're either things that you say have more intrinsic value, kind of like gifts or things like artwork that you inherited, and then there are things that you might use.\n",
      "Generally, how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I guess with the stuff that I've inherited, it's just what I feel.\n",
      "I don't really research it or anything, but it's just sometimes it feels like it's old stuff that... I don't know, I always enjoyed history and the way that we can take these items when you go to a museum and you look at these items and you think about the history that they sort of reflect.\n",
      "When I look at an item from my parents or from my grandparents and I think about the history reflected in it, I feel like it could be valuable not just to me or to my grandkids, but also that it might have some financial value too just in its age.\n",
      "Then of course the older that it gets, perhaps the more valuable that it gets, but I'm not sure.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. So the next question also has to do with insight.\n",
      "There’s a lot of literature that describes problems with patients who have this disorder having low insight.\n",
      "So if I were to ask you how you would define the concept of insight, how would you define it?\n",
      "Interviewee: The extent to which the client recognizes or is aware of the fact that they have a problem with too much clutter and difficulty parting with objects and that they consider that to be not in their best interest, and therefore something that they would like to correct.\n",
      "So in my view, this is awareness of illness more like schizophrenia.\n",
      "Where in this case, the person who hoards their attachment, their strong feeling about an object, that they recognize that they have a very strong feeling about it and other people don’t, and therefore what they do because of that strong feeling has gotten them into trouble and other people don’t have that problem and they would like to be more like other people.\n",
      "That’s the best I can do with it right now.\n",
      "It’s not insight in the sense of OCD symptoms where you are aware that the thing that you fear in terms of the obsession that a person has, so you know, serious health consequence of touching this thing, you know, touching, I don’t know, dirty toilet.\n",
      "That they exaggerate that and believe that a consequence could occur.\n",
      "It’s not quite the same, it doesn’t fit.\n",
      "We’ve tried for some years to figure out how to assess insight in hoarding disorder, and it’s not going to be the same way we assess it.\n",
      "So the brown assessment of beliefs scale doesn’t work well.\n",
      "We’ve tried, but we haven’t gone over into the literature on schizophrenia for example or psychosis to see whether there’s a better instrument over there.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying that, about this distinction.\n",
      "I’m going to try to articulate what you just said and you can correct me is that it’s not so much insight is that the patients recognize that their need to keep things is irrational, so much is that they recognize that their behavior is a problem and they want to change the problem in hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "I think that there's a lot I could do without feeling bad about it, but I just got started, then I could get it done, but when it came down to, I don't know, maybe half of this stuff, then I would start feeling bad about getting rid of it, but I might not need to get rid of half the stuff.\n",
      "Maybe if I can just get rid of what doesn't pain me to get rid of, then we'll have the space needed and we can just move the boxes to...\n",
      "The basement's divided into two areas, so if I can cut them in half and divide half around the corner, then I might not even have to get rid of anything that's really important to me, and we can still get that remodeled.\n",
      "It's just a question of really doing it.\n",
      "I don't know if that answered your question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, no, that does.\n",
      "It sounds like for you it seems like there might be a little bit of distress, but that a lot of it's really just not having enough time, which makes sense for someone that is a parent that has two kids and also is taking care of their mother and then also has a full-time job.\n",
      "That's a lot of things going on, so that makes sense.\n",
      "It sounds like some of these items, like you said...\n",
      "Some of the things that you realize may be useful, but are...\n",
      "Either you don't have enough space or some of these objects that are not as intrinsically valuable or monetarily valuable.\n",
      "It sounds like getting rid of those things is not as difficult, but if you had to get rid of something that someone else had gifted you, how difficult or how upset would you be if you had to do that?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Depends on the person and the gift.\n",
      "It's interesting because one problem that we have are wedding gifts.\n",
      "For some reason, I don't really have much attachment to these wedding gifts, but I'm terribly afraid of offending the people that have given them to me.\n",
      "That makes me unlikely to do anything with them, but the things that I have the most attachment to are probably the more historic things, the heirlooms that have been in our family for a while.\n",
      "Those would be pretty painful to get rid of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The ones that have either the memories attached to them or the historical value or the...\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Those would be difficult.\n",
      "The next several questions are kind of distinguishing hoarding disorder from things that are not hoarding disorder.\n",
      "What would you say are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "029\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Start the recording.\n",
      "... And do you have any last minute questions before we jump into the interview?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Not that come to mind.\n",
      "But thank you for asking.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well we can go ahead and start then, if you're comfortable?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So as I mentioned before, this study is investigating attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "But the first question I want to ask you is what term you prefer when we're talking about difficulties with clutter, and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "You're asking me what term?\n",
      "Say that again please.\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What term you would prefer when we're referring to difficulties with clutter and difficulties with discarding items?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Oh, I don't really care.\n",
      "If you're using hoarding, it's fine with me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I don't find it offensive, is that what you're concerned about?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We just want to make sure you're comfortable.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so the next section of the interview that we'll be moving onto is a series of questions.\n",
      "And so this is more like a conversation between us, rather than me asking you to give me lists of items.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So we'll first talk about behavior and treatment seeking, and how we can get into this is, would you mind describing your problems with clutter and how long this has been going on for you?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "It's been going on about 20 years, and I'm 73 now.\n",
      "That's around the time when my parents died, and I brought so much stuff into my home from their home.\n",
      "So it's somewhere in that range of 20 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and what does your hoarding disorder look like right now?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well my desktop is covered.\n",
      "Is that the kind of answer you're looking for?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah, my desktop is covered with things.\n",
      "Sometimes I get really lucky and I have it all nice and neat, and orderly.\n",
      "But it doesn't take a lot to get too much stuff on the desk.\n",
      "There's a couple of boxes on the floor because I don't have room for everything.\n",
      "But, I have a big counter behind me.\n",
      "I do buy all these different sorting devices, I make attempts to try to figure out how to use organizing types of things.\n",
      "And, it just doesn't last very long.\n",
      "There's all these different categories, and then I end up putting stuff where it shouldn't have been, or I'll get a new pile of paper in.\n",
      "I need to move it out of the living area of my home.\n",
      "So it'll come in here and that'll be another pile.\n",
      "P3: And and kind of a follow up on that, uh in terms of the intended use of the space so that you have some functions INAUDIBLE (38:43) substantially compromises the intended use, um do you ever think about um whether there might be other appropriate uses for example, somebody who wants to use the space for storage where that space might not be intended for storage, but I guess I’m wondering what is an appropriate intended use for a space?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm uh um I I think the way I determine this so for example kitchen is intended to be used for cooking, and bedroom is for sleeping and um dining table is intended to to you can sit there and eat, yeah.\n",
      "P3: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah so that’s how I determine it.\n",
      "P3: The intended use, okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "P3: Um, the next criteria, the last criteria actually I’d like you to think through with us is the one that starts ‘this difficulty is due to a preceded need to save items and the distress associated with discarding them’ eh and um what we were wondering about this one was how you assess someone’s distress to determine what’s normal or abnormal with regard to discarding, what for you is distinguishing from abnormal stress?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so um uh so so if someone says if that I want I want to get rid of this but I can’t bring myself to do this and because I would feel sad or it would be terrible if I can’t find it anymore, then like if I get rid of it later I can’t I when I want to use it I can’t have it it's like uh so when they have a lot of um uh when uh, because these would be like normal uh consequences for for normal people like we often will get rid of things and then later we realize ‘oh we shouldn’t have get gotten rid of that I can I could have used it now’ but its not um for people without hoarding disorder it wasn’t it wouldn’t feel like like almost like the end of the world or very um very extreme but for people with hoarding disorder they tend to um um consider these as very intolerable situations and emotions are quiet strong, yeah.\n",
      "P3: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: Am I answering your question?\n",
      "(laughing)\n",
      "P3: Yeah no no I think you, are I guess I’m wondering-\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "P3: If you think patients do have lower levels of insight into their disorder um it might sometimes have difficulty with this criteria, or they might not be aware of how distressed they are?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah yeah yeah they um they can they can say that ‘oh I already I know that I’m going to get rid of it and then sometimes I thought I should often’ so how long how long have have this uh this the INAUDIBLE (42:02) thing been sitting there and often times they would say ‘oh actually it's over a year now’, and so that that will give me an idea of maybe this is not its not as easy as they think it is for them to get rid of it.\n",
      "P3: So they might not realize, they might not even realize that they have distress, so it's not even that they might be denying it to you they they really don’t know that they’re stressed.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm yeah.\n",
      "P3: Okay.\n",
      "And a couple of times, I wasn't feeling quite right.\n",
      "I was feeling like pent up, if you know what I mean?\n",
      "So I watched a sad movie, and that helped me have a little cry, to release that tension.\n",
      "So those are the other things I've done for myself during this, to deal with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You're giving me some coping strategies.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "You're a young person, I gather.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I recommend keeping a gratitude journal, if you've never tried it.\n",
      "You just write five things that you're grateful for and sometimes if you can't think of them, it's just taking a breath.\n",
      "But over the long-term, there's actually some scientific evidence that keeping a gratitude journal as a huge impact.\n",
      "I did it when I was younger.\n",
      "I don't even feel I need to do it anymore, because when I'm in that mood.\n",
      "I can tell myself, \"Okay, list some things you're grateful for.\"\n",
      "But it's not a bad habit if you have time, it can be really quick and it's just for you.\n",
      "And it could either be first thing in the morning, or it can be last thing at night.\n",
      "Just write five things a day you're grateful for.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'll definitely try that.\n",
      "Thank you for suggesting that.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "You're welcome.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I always love the life lesson I learn from those that have just a little bit more life experience.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "That's very sweet to hear.\n",
      "Yeah, that's really nice.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so this brings us to the end of the interview.\n",
      "The only questions I have left are questions, demographic stuff, and then your address so that we can send you your gift card.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I already have a card.\n",
      "You want to send me another one?\n",
      "You don't just add money to it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you'd like to give me your email address, we could potentially do it through that.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well, just send me the new card.\n",
      "That'll be fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So could I have your physical mailing address?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes, it's 1980 Quail Hollow Drive.\n",
      "Land 32720.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "32720?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And your first and last name.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Participant 29.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then your email address?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Okay it's pfleming10@icloud.com.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then you have the preference for the physical card, rather than online emailed electronic gift card.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are you sure?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "No. But, I don't know what would make me sure.\n",
      "It's like, \"Okay, I'm not going anywhere.\"\n",
      "How do you use the online card?\n",
      "Let me ask that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Usually whenever you check out at any sort of website, they'll have a space for a gift card code, and you enter in a code.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Like I said, I've only ordered two things online.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We'll send you the card then.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I have to say that we're really fortunate in that I guess that as bad as it is for most other people, I've been able to keep my job and I've been able to stay relatively safe.\n",
      "My husband has been able to work from home, and so he's able to watch the kids more or less during the day.\n",
      "I mean of course it's hard, but I just feel like I can't complain because there's been people who have been in such worse condition.\n",
      "It's hard to have the kids home inside all day.\n",
      "It's hard for them to not see very many friends regularly.\n",
      "It's hard for my husband to get work done well while the kids are trying to entertain themselves.\n",
      "We feel like we didn't get a lot of out the school year last year, and we're wondering how this next year is going to go.\n",
      "We're not really sure how we can... how flexible our schedules can be to adapt to what the school is going to be doing.\n",
      "There's always going to be that impact.\n",
      "For a while, my parents were... I have to say my dad.\n",
      "My mom was not aware, but my dad was worried enough for both of them.\n",
      "Now, it seems like they have sort of adapted to it.\n",
      "I wasn't seeing them for March or April.\n",
      "I guess I didn't see them until June.\n",
      "I sort of took three months off from visiting them because I was worried, still going into work and stuff.\n",
      "I wasn't sure if I would expose them to something.\n",
      "As we've kind of decided now that it's better off for me to be available to them than to shut myself off from them, no matter what the situation is with COVID, I've started spending more time with them again down there.\n",
      "I go down about once a weekend.\n",
      "I mean that is about it for us.\n",
      "Again, it's nothing like losing jobs or not knowing what to do with your children while you work because daycare is closed.\n",
      "Fortunately, we have this thing covered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm happy to hear that both you and your husband were able to keep your job.\n",
      "That's certainly a nice thing to have.\n",
      "Thinking now kind of towards clutter problems, has COVID impacted anything with either acquiring things or difficulty with discarding?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, I don't believe it has.\n",
      "I don't think it's done either of those.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and hasn't really affected any sense of connectedness or attachment to items or your attempts to declutter?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why would you say it's a problem right now?\n",
      "What makes it a problem?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Since the COVID thing, I've been isolating in the house, and it has grown out into the den.\n",
      "My kitchen's never, the counters are very ... I think I've got about three feet of visible counter space right now.\n",
      "I just have stuff and odds and ends piled up all over the place.\n",
      "I didn't do that before.\n",
      "I don't know why.\n",
      "Now, I'm going, God, if I can just keep the living room, the front of the house decent, and it's even kind of messy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like it's gotten worse since you've been home?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah, it's gotten worse since I've just been home, and not able to move about, because of the restrictions and everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Have you been more isolated since COVID?\n",
      "Do you feel like you've had problems just socializing at all?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I've been more isolated, because the usual thing that I would do, going to the gym, I make jewelry.\n",
      "Oh boy, we don't even want to talk about that.\n",
      "The amount of money I have tied up in beads and components.\n",
      "I would meet with those friends at the shop on a weekly basis, and that went away.\n",
      "Some of the structure in my life went away.\n",
      "That was an issue.\n",
      "Then, the granddaughter's spring break, I'm basically the ya-ya Uber service for getting her to her activities and everything.\n",
      "Of course, all that stopped.\n",
      "Basically, lost a lot of structure to the day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "And the senior citizen center closed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "That is a lot of changes.\n",
      "It sounds like you have definitely had your life totally disrupted by all this.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like it's-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "That's my excuse, anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like it's been really difficult.\n",
      "It sounds like, like you said, a lot of the things that you used to structure your day have been taken away from you.\n",
      "It also sounds like you must be seeing people a whole lot less than you were.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Texting or Zoom sessions or FaceTime, it's just not the same.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, it is not.\n",
      "That is true.\n",
      "Do you feel like it's impacted your purchasing or your shopping or buying at all?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Me and Amazon, we're tight.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You and me both.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Way too much spending.\n",
      "I realized too late to stock up on hand sanitizer and this, that.\n",
      "In the early stages, when you couldn't get paper, disposable masks and before the cottage mask making industry really took off, man, I've got aloe and alcohol and bottles to make hand sanitizer.\n",
      "Paper towels to make disposable masks ...\n",
      "Shop towels.\n",
      "Long story, but anyway, I ordered supplies right and left, and did a lot of impulse purchasing.\n",
      "Again, bought clothes that I didn't need.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok. So we think the best thing to do is to send a follow-up time with you by email and, again, to finish the rest of the questions we have at that point and then maybe to ask you some additional questions that will arise as we kind of continue our interviews.\n",
      "It that an okay way to proceed?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "That will be fine with me.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Um, excellent.\n",
      "Interviewee: So you’ll be in touch…\n",
      "Interviewer 1: We really, really…\n",
      "Interviewee: We’ll set up another time?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah we will.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "We’ll send an email as we get off the call.\n",
      "We really appreciate your time and all of your work has been really great to read and this has been an extremely interesting conversation and I think that we both will look forward to continuing it when you have more time.\n",
      "Interviewee: Alright.\n",
      "I will too.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, thank you very much.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Well, perfect timing because I've just moved and I do have lots and lots of boxes and I've had the tendency to save the boxes thinking, \"Oh, you know...\"\n",
      "Well, actually I saved them thinking I'm going to need them for when I go through everything and separate give away, donate, recycle, throw away, and keep.\n",
      "So, I'll need boxes for that.\n",
      "So, for quite a while I did have many, many boxes in a couple of the rooms and garage of my place.\n",
      "But then I talked myself out of that because there are places in the nearby town, there are stores that lease out loads and loads of boxes, and not flattened boxes, for anybody to take any time.\n",
      "And so, I thought, \"Oh, I don't need to save boxes anymore.\"\n",
      "So, I'm really good now.\n",
      "This is just a recent thing.\n",
      "I'm really good now about flattening the boxes and taking the wrap thing, the paper that was used inside the boxes to keep things from rattling around or whatever, and taking them to the recycle center.\n",
      "Yay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, now we'll move onto the next little story that I have for you.\n",
      "So, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom he must remove several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "So, do you think that this exhibits more a hoarding disorder or more clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "That's hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and why do you think it's hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Well, because he cannot... I mean, oh my god, if I couldn't get to my bathroom quickly and easily, I'd be in big trouble.\n",
      "So, I'm at the stage of life where I...\n",
      "Sorry, this is recorded but I don't care.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You're okay.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I have to pee pretty often and it's like oh my gosh, it's urgent.\n",
      "I've got to go when I've got to go.\n",
      "So, no, that would not work.\n",
      "Not being able to access rooms and be able to walk through one's house easily, no, no, no. That's dangerous and yeah, that's really not good.\n",
      "And not being able to find important things.\n",
      "You need a whole hour to find them, uh-uh.\n",
      "No way.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And, um, could you think of a specific case or a number of cases that were particularly difficult or challenging to diagnose either clinically or in research?\n",
      "Because we are kind of on the border between pathological and non-pathological behavior or borderline sub-clinical.\n",
      "And kind of talk through that case or cases and how you made the distinction between something that was sub-clinical or something that was not true hoarding disorder and hoarding disorder patient.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well there’s two, two ways to think about that.\n",
      "One is what disorder overlaps.\n",
      "So, we had a hoarding case, someone who was in one of our treatment groups, one of our INAUDIBLE [24:23] treasure groups, and this was a woman whose home was filled with papers and a lot of trash, foods, cans, cans where the food was already eaten, and so forth.\n",
      "So her home looked much like a hoarded home.\n",
      "But it turns out, going to her home and talking with her about the things that were in her home, that the clutter in her home was collected because of an OCD problem and not a hoarding problem.\n",
      "So she had a compulsive checking ritual where she had to read and study everything that came into the house that had any kind of writing or geometric design on it before she could throw it out.\n",
      "And she abandoned that ritual, which meant that she stopped throwing things out.\n",
      "So everything that came into her home that had writing or symbols or anything on it, she simply kept because that ritual’s too omorous for her to engage in, so she couldn’t let it go.\n",
      "So that was a case, that without going to her home and examining the items in her home and talking with her about the items in her home, it would have been impossible to tell because she did have great difficulty throwing things away.\n",
      "It would have been impossible to tell that this was OCD instead of hoarding disorder.\n",
      "On the other hand, we’ve had people… and the other kind, I think that you referred to as the distinction between, that line, where do you cross the line between being sub-clinical and clinical, which is a little bit harder thing to focus on.\n",
      "We have had cases, several of them, people who come in for help and go into our INAUDIBLE [26: 35] program and they describe difficulty with discarding, they describe problems with excessive acquisition, but the level of clutter in their home is not something that impinges very seriously on their life.\n",
      "And so those are the ones that I think are the hardest to distinguish because it, with respect to the diagnostic criteria, there needs to be enough clutter that it impinges on their life, and the inclinity to be in the living area of the home.\n",
      "Some of these folks have clutter in their attics, basement, garage and so forth, not in areas central to their living environment.\n",
      "And it’s not necessarily that someone else has control of the living area.\n",
      "And so those are the cases that are a little tougher to diagnose properly.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And how do you make the distinction for those individuals?\n",
      "Interviewee: The distinction…yeah… the way I make the distinction is the level distress associated with the management of possessions.\n",
      "By management I mean both the acquisition and the disposition – where it goes, how much care is required, and so forth.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I sometimes did before quarantine, because I do live alone.\n",
      "And some of my friends are couples.\n",
      "And I would get together with them, but nonetheless, sometimes I would have that feeling of loneliness.\n",
      "Or, when I'm home and you just need another pair of hands, that sort of thing.\n",
      "And my friends, who are married, amazingly this group of friends in this area, their husbands are all super handy men, and they don't have to do anything.\n",
      "So I get those feelings when I feel like, \"Ugh, I have to do it all, and I have to figure out how to do it.\"\n",
      "But, I always would counter it by making plans with friends, and having friends over.\n",
      "So now, I can't do that.\n",
      "Like I haven't had anyone come in the house.\n",
      "So that's been really hard.\n",
      "I haven't had a meal with anyone in four months.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's a long time.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I don't know if you have to deal with that.\n",
      "But, it's self-imposed, some of my friends do get together and have dinner, but it's not social distancing, and I'm not going to do it.\n",
      "So I do miss it tremendously, I miss going to a restaurant for a meal, instead of my own cooking all the time.\n",
      "So, that part is really hard on me.\n",
      "But that's why I do the other things that I do, to try to counter balance.\n",
      "But without Sophie, my little dog.\n",
      "I just can't imagine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm really glad that you have her.\n",
      "Yeah, it sounds like she's a big source of joy.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "She's so sweet.\n",
      "Everyone loves her.\n",
      "Everybody loves her.\n",
      "But it's really hard not to have anybody to hug.\n",
      "I would hug my girlfriends and their husbands, and the children.\n",
      "I have children in the neighborhood I'm really close to and they would come over and we would do art together or play games.\n",
      "And none of that is going on.\n",
      "So I miss that a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sometimes physical contact and the physical presence of others, it's like you can only do so much with a phone call for FaceTime.\n",
      "So it's understandable, and it's hard right now.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm glad to hear though, that you're keeping up with exercise and that you seem to be doing well, even though there definitely are the struggles that you recognize during this time period.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah, I think I'm doing okay.\n",
      "That's what I say.\n",
      "I'm doing okay, I'm managing, and I'm going to continue to manage.\n",
      "And, the other thing that I do ...\n",
      "Actually.\n",
      "There's two things.\n",
      "One is gratitude, when I'm feeling really down.\n",
      "I just turn to gratitude, and remind myself of all the things I have to be grateful for.\n",
      "And I think that really does lift my spirits.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, okay.\n",
      "So that brings us to the next thing I wanted to ask you.\n",
      "So as part of this interview we’re using the different kind of breakdown of the concept of insight that I think is from one of your papers.\n",
      "So defensiveness as you already mentioned and anosognosia, overvalued ideation, indifference.\n",
      "And we just kind of wanted to talk with you about your experience with people with this disorder and how… we’ve already talked about anosognosia and how that variation is very prevalent in the patients that you see and so when we talk about a problem of insight, do patients normally have, is it just overvalued ideation, to what is the extent of defensiveness or indifference?\n",
      "And does the idea of indifference kind of… something that we heard from previous interviews is that when patients are indifferent, it can be difficult to distinguish hoarding disorder from disorders like depression where they’re simply indifferent to their surroundings or they don’t throw things away because they don’t care, and I wonder if you can talk through whether, kind of, insight.\n",
      "Interviewee: Um I’m not quite sure I fully understood that.\n",
      "Hardly I think that the difference, the insight related things related to defensiveness and coping, I think.\n",
      "Um, when I see someone saying they don’t have a problem, most often it is when you work with agencies that have a lot of contact with people with hoarding problems – health departments, INAUDIBLE [48:19] agencies, so forth.\n",
      "Their view of people with hoarding disorder typically is that most of them don’t have insight, but in part that’s because of who is asking the question and the purpose behind the question.\n",
      "So part of the insight problem has to do with the context in which the interview occurs and what information is used to make the decision.\n",
      "So if I go to someone’s home and they know I’m there because there’s some suspicion that there’s something wrong with them or the way they live, they are likely to be more defensive and deny a problem than if I’m talking to someone and asking them about what possessions they have that are valuable and the extent to which, the cost of having those possessions.\n",
      "I’m not quite sure if that answers your question, but I think it speaks to this issue of insight and what it means because we treat insight as though it is a stable characteristic.\n",
      "And I think in hoarding, it’s not necessarily stable and that it’s under the influence of the context in which the interaction is taking place between two people and that context has a lot to do with whether someone will deny they have a problem or admit that they have a problem.\n",
      "And an example: I went on a heavy duty cleaning once with a crew in New York City with a case, a hoarding case, where the individual had been cleaned out five or six times before, so this is a repeat.\n",
      "And so everyone involved knew this individual and believed that this individual had no insight into this.\n",
      "So I spent the day there, and much of the day I spent talking with the individual as the cleaning was going on.\n",
      "Most of the time he was quite distressed trying to control the workers and telling them what to throw away, what not to throw away.\n",
      "And so for the whole day, he was INAUDIBLE [50:36] the fact that they were doing this, that this was horrible, they shouldn’t be doing this, they didn’t have the right to be doing this, but yet there was a period of time about ten minutes long during the day where, as we discussed this in a little more, I don’t know if I would call it objective, but a little dispassionate way he did admit.\n",
      "He said to me that “yeah I know I keep too many things and I know this is a problem for my family and I try to control it in certain ways.”\n",
      "He described those ways, his family tried to help him control it but they haven’t been able to.\n",
      "And then a few minutes later he was back to arguing with the crew about not throwing things away.\n",
      "So this was the case where, the one case where I saw very little insight for most of the day, but yet there was a period of time where this gentleman did have insight, and he was reflective and understood there’s something wrong.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that’ll be interesting.\n",
      "I’m probably going to be doing a simple study pf my telephone messages, and maybe generating a group of people to call my phone and leave a message, because I know that what happens is people with hoarding disorder will take more time to express an idea, because it’s so filled with detail and irrelevant detail compared to other people.\n",
      "And that I think speaks partly to the information processing problem that these folks have, and maybe speaks to the way in which the brain is wired, it’s this ‘too many branches’ idea.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm.\n",
      "Ok, well I really appreciate your time, and [NAME 44:05] do you have anything else before we wrap up?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, no. I don’t think I have anything else.\n",
      "We would just… yeah, like you mentioned, we really appreciated the opportunity to get back in touch with you at some point in the future as we move forward in the process of developing and maybe piloting that patient interview.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure, I’ll be happy to do that.\n",
      "I’m pretty much flat out until June, so I wouldn’t be able to do anything before June.\n",
      "Just keep that in mind, I don’t know how quickly you’re moving.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: [inaudible 44:35]\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok, well good luck!\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Thank you, so much.\n",
      "Interviewee: I’ll talk to you later.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Bye.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Take care, bye.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "It takes up the master bedroom to the point that I cannot open a closet door.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "The kitchen, again, it's just messy.\n",
      "I've got stuff on the counters.\n",
      "Everything from small appliances like a crock pot that I need to just go put back on its shelf, to ...\n",
      "Oh gosh, I tried Nutrisystem for a while, so I still have some of that stuff sitting out.\n",
      "In the den where I spend most of my time, oh God, I've got one, two, three dog beds, four dog beds in here.\n",
      "Yeah, four dog beds, and one chair is covered with clothes.\n",
      "Then, the breakfast table has been covered with beading stuff, because, my jewelry making stuff, for a couple of years, because I've been reorganizing it, and can't get that finished and can't quit buying either.\n",
      "That's that situation.\n",
      "Guest bedroom and front office are so crowded that I just shut the doors on them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like the place you spend most of the time right now is your den.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's cluttered, but it has your stuff out on the table.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How does it make you feel to be in that space?\n",
      "Do you enjoy looking over your beading supplies for instance, or your stuff, or does it stress you out?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "No. All of this stresses me out.\n",
      "That's the really perverse part of it, that I know that if I cleaned it up, and eliminated the clutter, I would feel less stressed, and less guilt about, instead of sitting here watching this, you're playing this computer game, you could be up there getting rid of this, and cleaning up that, and you'd feel better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You feel like if it was less cluttered, you would enjoy the space more, and you would feel-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Oh, Lord yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like ideally?\n",
      "What would you get rid of, what would the space ...\n",
      "How much stuff would you have?\n",
      "Would it be all away and organized, or would it not be present in your home at all?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "The excess stuff that I'm realistically not using, won't use, would be gone.\n",
      "My kitchen would be, right now, I've enjoyed cooking in the past, doing family dinners and that kind of thing, back in the day.\n",
      "Right now, I've got so much clutter in the kitchen, that it's difficult to work in, because I have to move things around to make space, so that I can prepare meals, dadadadada.\n",
      "I would have a much more normal, regular way of doing.\n",
      "I don't think I'll ever be super neat, but if you can sit in all the spaces that I have, and the living room looks pretty, it's a lived-in space, but it's a welcoming space.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Okay, so I'm sitting in my living room, which has four seating areas, two lounge chairs, and two couches, and one couch and two lounge chairs are absolutely free for anybody to sit on, and one couch next to my lounge chair is covered in pens, piles of artists' books, different types of sketch pads, an extra box of glasses and different pens, like reading glasses, and some rocks that I picked up at the beach that I've been drawing on and a magazine over there that's been there way too long but it has some really cool pictures that I think I'll refer to again, and a plugin for my phone, and stuff that doesn't belong on a couch.\n",
      "But that couch is no longer for people to sit on.\n",
      "It's a flat space to hold my stuff in reach of when I sit in the living room.\n",
      "And I have a whole bunch of games and stuff in a corner here, in case we need to play a game, which we never do unless my son and his wife visit, then we do play a game.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just in case.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "My dining room table is not doing too bad right now but generally is overly covered with mail I need to go through.\n",
      "There's piles separated, and the way I separate piles, look at, to do, to file, give to my daughter, and a pile for my husband, of papers.\n",
      "Mail.\n",
      "Stuff like that.\n",
      "Still, to do.\n",
      "So when we eat at the table, all that stuff is piled on one side, and we eat on the other side of the table.\n",
      "And then every so often it's totally clear, and I get through those piles.\n",
      "They are filed.\n",
      "I do all the bills.\n",
      "Everything's clear again.\n",
      "It's like, \"Ah.\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Okay.\"\n",
      "And then suddenly it's covered again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "And then I have an extra table I put up in my dining room, a small four by two foot table because I've been making greeting cards and it's covered with everything I need to make greeting cards, but it certainly makes my kitchen look full, and full of cluttered things.\n",
      "And then, oh my god, I have a flat space to the left of my stove that, for me, it's not used for kitchen crap, and I've got my supplements there, and more piles of papers, and then there's a whole section of unique items that I've collected.\n",
      "There's a little cool vase full of feathers.\n",
      "They're turkey feathers from my yard.\n",
      "There's seed pods, and, I'm going to walk over there.\n",
      "You know, interesting rocks, and a little jar that I got in Mexico, and it's got more rocks in it, and little things I've collected from different countries.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I'm not going anywhere to use a card.\n",
      "So I don't know, maybe it won't get used either way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well if you have the physical card, you can use it both online and in person, since you have the information.\n",
      "So we can send you that.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "You just know that things get lost in my papers, so I was thinking seriously, should I?\n",
      "I'm trying to change my ways.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's up to you.\n",
      "I was about to say, but I didn't want to mention that.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Let me try it online.\n",
      "Let me see how I do with that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "It'll be an interesting change.\n",
      "I haven't don't anything like that before, so I like learning new ways to do things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We'll go ahead and give you that opportunity then.\n",
      "We'll send it your way so you should receive an email with that gift card and if for some reason you don't receive it, then you have those two numbers to contact that I gave you earlier on today.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And the last few questions.\n",
      "Do you identify has female?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and is this your sex that was assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What race are you?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "White, Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And it asks about household income, but you are retired, correct?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We already know your geographic region.\n",
      "And your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I have a Bachelor of Science degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And just out of curiosity for our own personal sake, what was your job that you had prior?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I was a human resources director for a major corporation.\n",
      "I worked my way up, so I had a bunch of jobs, but the last quite a few years of my career was in human resources, and I'm originally from Rochester, New York.\n",
      "But what brought me to Florida was I got a job transfer to our Latin America region.\n",
      "So I was working mainly in South America the last couple of years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "And I had a home in Miami.\n",
      "But, after I retired, I really didn't want to stay there.\n",
      "So I moved here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you've been there ever since.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "I started in marketing, just short story.\n",
      "I found it very unrewarding, and decided I wanted to do something more rewarding.\n",
      "So I transitioned into the human resources field.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "And had a number of jobs within the organization.\n",
      "But worked my way up to a director level in a major corporation.\n",
      "So that was pretty good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is cool to hear.\n",
      "Thank you for sharing that with me.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: Right. And I guess kind of these question fit into that whole idea which has a lot do with insight.\n",
      "So, there’s this brown assessment of belief scale about the degree to which patients are able to correctly identify their INAUDIBLE [42:09] as being a part of a disorder.\n",
      "And so my question to you is when you talk to patients, for example, one of the questions on the scale is, what do you think has caused you to have these behaviors, these hoarding behaviors?\n",
      "Do these behaviors have a psychiatric or an underlying biological cause?\n",
      "In talking to patients, do you think that patients see their behavior as having a biological cause, a psychological cause, a personal history cause, in cases where they do actually recognize that they have a disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, I think again we’ve got some variability there, and they’re doing their best like we all are to explain why they do what they do, which is getting them into trouble.\n",
      "So I wouldn’t necessarily trust what patients say about why they do what they do in terms of being the quote on quote real explanation for it.\n",
      "Although, they’re certainly observers of their own behavior, so whatever they tell you is going to be useful in terms of clinical treatment.\n",
      "Um, but it’s sort of another version of the same question you asked earlier if there are, if these are post hoc explanations for things.\n",
      "You know, if you got a big problem, you grasp at straws to explain why.\n",
      "At the same time, some of those reasons could be very valid.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Well I did make some progress at first.\n",
      "One of the things that I would do, if you go to a play or a concert, there's a program, and usually there's a lot of interesting information about the performers or the composer, and all of that, and I start reading it during the intermission, but then I always take it home and think I'm going to finish reading it later, it's really interesting.\n",
      "And then of course, I don't so I did throw out a whole stack of things like that.\n",
      "Like theater programs and concert programs, when they first started the quarantine.\n",
      "I did get rid of a lot of stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about...\n",
      "Sorry, go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I was just going to say that I think I went through a flurry of that, but then after that, it's like now I've kind of distracted to other things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "How about your sense of connectedness or the attachment you have to your items, do you think it's been strengthened because of COVID or weakened?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I don't think it's...\n",
      "Well it definitely hasn't been strengthened, and I don't know that it's been weakened.\n",
      "I think a lot of it is...\n",
      "It's easy to say, \"I just don't have time to sit down and go through things.\"\n",
      "And that's not really true.\n",
      "I think I could make the time.\n",
      "I think it's painful to have to sit down and have to keep making decision after decision.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "I know you said it helped you declutter in the beginning, and you had a little bit more time for organizing in the beginning.\n",
      "Now I just want to know a little bit about your overall physical health.\n",
      "Have you been impacted at all, physically, by COVID?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "No. I actually, I'm pretty overweight, and I actually have lost weight since then.\n",
      "I think...\n",
      "Well maybe because I'm not going out.\n",
      "If you're just eating at home, it's easy to eat right.\n",
      "So I haven't noticed any negative health effects.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about in your mental health, your wellbeing?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "No, actually, mentally I don't think it's effected me at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about how it's effected your family financially, if at all?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "It hasn't effected us at all.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Great.\n",
      "So, to follow up on that, do you mean awareness of the behavior as the behavior?\n",
      "Or awareness as an unusual behavior?\n",
      "Or awareness of the behavior as an unusual behavior that also causes problems for them?\n",
      "Or both?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm I think it could be both.\n",
      "I mean, I think that they-- That someone with very poor insight would be on that scale, not even realizing that it would be a problem for everyone or anyone, thinking that “oh basically everyone saves this much stuff” or “everyone has difficulty throwing things out.”\n",
      "But for people that are slightly more insightful, they would probably recognize that its still problematic, that it still causes them difficulty, like it doesn’t usually cause-- Sorry I’m getting distracted-- Uhm that basically, that they realize that not everyone else does it, but that they don’t think its really that bad or that they don’t see why everyone cares about it so much… that they have a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Sure, ok.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "So, in the literature there’s been kind of a breakdown of the concept of insight and hoarding and the different constructs that may be present more for different individuals.\n",
      "So, some of those constructs include “defensiveness, anosognosia- or that lack of ability to perceive your illness as reducing your quality of life, overvalued ideations, abnormal beliefs in the value of items, and indifference.”\n",
      "Do you feel in your experience that any of these factors are more prevalent or more problematic in the individuals you work with, with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm can you repeat them?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah so, “defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideations, and indifference” have been some of the ones sited in the literature as kind of comprised in that insight.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Uhm I mean I think that they’re all certainly relevant.\n",
      "The most ones that I’ve probably seen the most uhm-- I think less so, indifference.\n",
      "Some-- I think the anosognosia and the overvalued ideation are probably more common with what I see clinically.\n",
      "But some people definitely have defensiveness; uhm I don’t usually see a whole lot of defensiveness with my actual clients because by that point, they’ve at least are willing to come in.\n",
      "It might be defensiveness that like a family member discusses when they call to see, but usually those people wouldn’t necessarily make it into treatment with me.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. And how do you go about explaining hoarding disorder-- How would you, to a patient with low insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm really try to hammer home the impairment that they have.\n",
      "So, the way that they can actually identify as the reasons that they would actually want to reduce the clutter or want to reduce, you know, their acquiring or other things.\n",
      "Uhm like if their family member won’t bring over, won’t go over, bring their kids over, or if their clutter is preventing them from getting needed repairs or their-- You know the really, kind of- staying on those kinds of features that are really impairing their lives.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "And kind of hitting it from that angle, have you found, in your experience, helps patients to be able to gain insight, making that connection to the consequences?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm yeah.\n",
      "I think for most of them, they get- they have more insight when thinking about the consequences that are tied in with it.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, or even if people come in and they're not trying to take anything away, to judge me on something as if it's a superficial thing, and not really realizing that it's a much deeper thing, and the risk of being judged is mentally unstable, that a piece of driftwood might be so important to me.\n",
      "I'm not far from mentally unstable, but there is something maybe a little bit weird about me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "There's something a little weird about everyone, though.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "So true, so true.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's what makes life interesting.\n",
      "That brings me to the end of all the questions that I have for you relating to hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Do you have any questions or anything that you'd like to further discuss?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "I'm curious about your goal in life in regards to your interactions with people and maybe your livelihood.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I'd be very happy to let you know what I'm pursuing.\n",
      "Do you mind if I ask you a few just paperwork questions real quick, and then I can discuss with you further?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so I have a few demographic questions that we're collecting.\n",
      "You can refuse to answer any of these if you prefer.\n",
      "Do you identify as female?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your race?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your household income?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "About 25,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And you've been mentioned some college education.\n",
      "Was your highest level of education a bachelor's degree?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. Are there certain kinds of people that are more likely to be hoarders: older or younger, different races, socioeconomic backgrounds, rural versus urban?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure-- Uhm I mean so the actual-- The actual amount of clutter usually takes a while to accumulate.\n",
      "And so that once their symptoms are really quite bad- that their- like the clutter itself, then they’re usually older.\n",
      "But they’ll have the patterns of difficulty discarding or excessive acquisition or either purchasing or passive acquisition of stuff from an early age.\n",
      "So, it’s more like the problem doesn’t become as interfering until they’re older, but they have it, I would say, more lifetime.\n",
      "And then you said other things… I mean I’m not, I mean the thing is that most of the research is going to be with Caucasian folks.\n",
      "It seems like the gender, although more people will come in presenting that are women, its seems like the research is both for women and men, at a little bit more equal numbers I believe.\n",
      "And I’m not sure really about, yeah, I’m not real sure about race beyond that more research is going to be done with more white folks.\n",
      "But the socioeconomic stuff, certainly part of the issue is that their hoarding is often going to result in money spent that would ordinarily be spent.\n",
      "So, they could have financial difficulties because of the hoarding, but I don’t know that I would argue that the financial problems came first.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. Can you think of a specific case or cases that you can remember that were challenging to diagnose because they were on the border between pathological and nonpathological behavior?\n",
      "And how you were able to make that distinction?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "I mean I remember one case from when I was pretty young and in some of the research- like [inaudible 00:23:24]- that did the in-office assessments, and the person’s report of their hoarding was pretty severe… even how they were describing when we would go room by room, and then when I went out to their home it wasn’t really all that bad.\n",
      "The actual clutter itself, it was quite minimal in comparison.\n",
      "So that person was like more on the cusp, but she made it seem like it was, you know, quite severe.\n",
      "So, I mean, in that case the in-home assessment was pretty helpful.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Kind of in a similar vein, have there been times when people have described things as being very mild, to the point where it’s not an issue and then you do the visit and find that things are much worse?\n",
      "Interviewee: Usually, let’s see, I think that there have certainly been cases like that, but a lot of the times I don’t end up being able to do in-home visits anymore; that’s because of insurance issues or things like that, or if they live quite a distance.\n",
      "And so-- But yeah you know-- I’ve definitely gone to places where it’s been a lot harder to travel through, to squeeze through anywhere.\n",
      "But I mean, especially when I was younger, I could certainly still do it, but I think it was a lot worse.\n",
      "And sometimes there was, I remember there was concern, where DCF had gotten called in and they-- So I anticipated it would ultimately be bad, but the person was trying to minimize it, I think out of concern about her DCF case.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. So next section of the interview I want to talk to you a little about the DSM-5 criteria for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think for the most part, what happens is that people go through long periods of time where they are criticized by family members, pressured by family members, and then maybe the authorities get involved and so they… One of the ways that people get in around here is when we run, we have a community forum on collecting and clutter and we make announcements about a very intensive workshop.\n",
      "It’s not therapy, it’s kind of a workshop, it’s kind of half a support group and half a self-help group, and that’s when people start getting more involved because it doesn’t feel like they’re getting into therapy, but then eventually that leads them to pursue more.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And how long would you say that this behavior has been going on, typically, before they get to that point?\n",
      "Interviewee: Usually decades.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And so, to kind of build off that, do you have any sense of hoarding over kind of a lifespan or is it something that has been going on for the person’s whole life?\n",
      "Did it start when they were a child or young adult or develop later in life?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, the research we’ve done on it suggests it starts fairly early, about somewhere in between 10 and 20 years old, and although it’s not serious then, the behaviors begin then.\n",
      "And they start getting serious a couple of decades later.\n",
      "And that once they move along that trajectory, that lifespan, they get more and more serious, and there are relatively few cases for whom that process reverses, relatively few cases who, on their own, get better.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And is your sense, again, [INAUDIBLE 24:09].\n",
      "Is it your sense that it’s a progressive disorder in the sense that the behaviors worsen or is it a progressive disorder in the sense that they accumulate more and more stuff and so it appears to be worse over time because they have more later?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that’s a good question.\n",
      "I don’t know the answer to that.\n",
      "Clearly, those things are confounded.\n",
      "As time goes by they get more and more stuff.\n",
      "Does the saving behavior get more extreme or more rigid?\n",
      "That I don’t know.\n",
      "I think… I have seen cases where the acquisition slows down, and so it’s an attempt by the person to stop, an attempt by the person to try to do something about it, but they do it by controlling the acquisition and not increasing the discarding.\n",
      "I guess I don’t really have a good sense of what an answer to that question might be.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And in terms of family and friends kind of playing a role in arriving at, you know, the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, do you have a sense of which family and friends are most often involved and how that goes?\n",
      "Interviewee: Usually it’s adult children of the individual, and sometimes it’s a sibling, sometimes it’s a spouse, but the majority of the cases I’ve seen where the family gets involved it’s the adult children of an elderly person who’s been doing it for many years and now may have had some kind of health setback and is going to have more trouble living in an environment that is heavily cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And do you feel that employees of institutions or states are frequently or infrequently involved with these cases or is it pretty rare, is it common?\n",
      "Landlords, police officers, you know, homeowner’s associations, those kinds of people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "You can have too much of something or some things are never considered useful, but in some circumstances it might be useful.\n",
      "I guess for you, having a smaller house, there's just the reality sometimes that there's just not enough space.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Which makes sense.\n",
      "Do you have any item in your house that you consider to be the most precious to you?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, I don't.\n",
      "There's no single item I can think of that's really the most precious to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "Some people have them and some people don't.\n",
      "Getting into some of the interference from maybe some of the clutter problems, can you describe a time that maybe clutter problems got in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I would go back to the...\n",
      "Nothing in particular, but I'd really like to be able to use the basement as a living space, since we don't have a lot of space, and the clutter down there does get in the way of that.\n",
      "I have to think of where to put all the stuff so that we can tear out the interior and redo it.\n",
      "My husband has stated he's perfectly willing to redo the basement, but we've just got to clear it out first.\n",
      "It's something that I really have to think about and I really have to reduce and figure out how to package the stuff up perhaps more compactly.\n",
      "Then we can get that done.\n",
      "Then that would give us more living space and improve our quality of life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is the task of having to get rid of enough stuff to make room for that remodeling, is that distressing?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No. Well, maybe a little, but not much.\n",
      "Mostly I have to find the time to do it, but again, I'm pulled into so many different directions.\n",
      "I bet there is stuff that I could get rid of without...\n",
      "Or stuff that could be digitized.\n",
      "We have many photos and papers and things.\n",
      "I'm pretty sure that I could digitize them and not have to keep the actual real thing.\n",
      "That would get rid of probably two boxes worth of stuff down there, but I just don't know when I can do that.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "What's that?\n",
      "Say it again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I need to redecorate my place now that you say that.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Now, I have a few last questions for you, and that's kind of the view on hoarding disorder in others and how you would distinguish hoarding disorder from what people might call normal collecting or saving behavior.\n",
      "How would you distinguish between the hoarding and saving things?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "When it gets past the point where you could actually realistically use all of it, where you really can't rationalize anymore that you're going to use it.\n",
      "I mean, I kind of rationalize now that I like to look at these things I thought I was going to use someday, like all the metal pieces for welding, sculptures, and stuff like that.\n",
      "I have so many ideas in my head and I'm capable of making them but it's just not getting done, so I'm saving those things now because I like looking at them and imagining what it could become, and I can rationalize anymore.\n",
      "I'm saving them because they will become something, and some of them will, but certainly in my lifetime not all of them can.\n",
      "Yeah, so it gets past a certain line of being able to really rationalize their usefulness, and I guess also when you can't use a space anymore that you would like to use, because it's covered with things that you are saving, that's a line where I judge myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It also seems that you mentioned that once a space gets to be unattractive or a space that you don't really like anymore because of the accumulation of items, that seems to bother you too.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, for sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And do you think that your behavior fits that definition of hoarding disorder or do you think that your behavior is separate from that?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Sorry, what definition of hoarding disorder are you asking about?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Whenever you said that hoarding is when it gets past the point of being able to rationally justify using items, do you think that that fits a description of your behavior or that you haven't necessarily reached that?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "No, I think it does define my issues for sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then where have you mostly seen information on hoarding?\n",
      "Has it been through the television shows that you mentioned or any other resources?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Hm. Probably originally through the television show, but I mean, years ago I went to university and the psychology department, I might have first learned about it there.\n",
      "And then working in the mental health field just the last 15 years with children, it's been an issue that I discuss with their therapist and stuff like that, often around food hoarding or their home environment.\n",
      "They might live with hoarders, so the concept has come up.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhmm.\n",
      "And thinking specifically about, um, kind of that distinction between normal saving behavior and what would constitute hoarding disorder, can you think of specific cases or a case that was particularly challenging for you to make the distinction between whether you were dealing with a true disorder or normal saving behavior?\n",
      "And how did you end up making your decision in that case.\n",
      "Interviewee: The cases that I have seen have already been bedded within our research project.\n",
      "So, and I’ve not been the one who is overseeing the diagnostic process where I would be likely to encounter that.\n",
      "Um, there are a couple of things that I can point to.\n",
      "The, one of the problems that we have encountered and I have seen is, uh, a couple of situations where the level of depression was so high, both of these were men interestingly, that it looked like the hoarded home or the cluttered home and the disorganized home was really about being unable to get themselves to do anything that would clean up the house or enable them to keep things straight.\n",
      "And, that looked like an emotional problem with depression more than a powerful urge to save.\n",
      "That is, I’m just to tired, I can’t do it versus oh I need to hang on to this.\n",
      "It’s that rationale.\n",
      "That can be a little bit more difficult.\n",
      "I’ve seen a number of OCD cases that had hoarding mixed in but was not the sole problem.\n",
      "And just a couple of OCD cases in which, that what looked like hoarding was in fact OCD, and the only reason it stuck with them is that it was contaminated and couldn’t touch it.\n",
      "That is not because they wanted to hang on to it, they were stuck with it.\n",
      "So, the best, I don’t find that particularly difficult.\n",
      "Somebody who didn’t have a background in OCD might.\n",
      "But sometimes I worry about people who are organizers who may or may not be able to make that distinction.\n",
      "Same with the depression.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, and that kind of moves us nicely into the next question or the next set of questions, which looks specifically at the DSM five criteria.\n",
      "Um, and, so the first part of that question is have you ever had to use these criteria, um, and applied it to the intensive diagnosing an individual with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Have you ever been part of that diagnosing process?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, yes and no. I have not, at this stage, late stage of my career, had to sit down and diagnose people using the structured interview for hoarding disorder INAUDIBLE [27:49] that NAME [27:51] have used, that’s the standard interview that is available at this point.\n",
      "I’ve never had to use that to diagnose, and that’s because I’ve never been in that position in terms of looking where the client, since that was developed.\n",
      "You know, only a few years old now.\n",
      "Uh, but, at the same time I, uh, I was part of the process of developing the criteria that now are DSM five.\n",
      "So it is hard to say I’m not involved in it, we were heavily involved in it.\n",
      "It’s just that it wasn’t in DSM five at the time.\n",
      "On the weekends when I was home, it's like, I don't want to do anything, I'm going to just decompress, et cetera, et cetera, and move on.\n",
      "That was a big change.\n",
      "That, I think, is when the clutter really started building.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It was really after you got back.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "My guest bedroom turned into my packing, unpacking triage room.\n",
      "It just really started getting out of control then.\n",
      "From 2005 to 2016, is when it all built up.\n",
      "Then, when I got home, I still didn't do anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you been impacted financially by COVID?\n",
      "It sounds like you were retired before COVID, has this had any financial impact-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah, I was retired before COVID.\n",
      "No, I've got a decent income, I've got enough to pay the bills.\n",
      "I don't have ... I didn't save enough early on to take advantage of compounding my money.\n",
      "My grand plans for retiring and cruising and traveling the world, I don't have the money for that.\n",
      "Plus, now with the granddaughter, extra money goes to enrichment things for her, because my son and daughter-in-law are not ...\n",
      "Their income is not wonderful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I've kind of come to grips with it, and have figured out what I can do, what I can't do, and try and make it really a high-value reward when I do travel somewhere.\n",
      "That's my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How have you been coping since COVID, especially since you stopped working so much?\n",
      "What sorts of things have you been doing to help yourself, to feel better during this time?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Oh, play computer games, watch lots of TV.\n",
      "Before the temperature hits 90, which is by 9:00 a.m., go out and play with the dogs in the yard.\n",
      "Do a little gardening, et cetera, et cetera.\n",
      "Do water walking at the pool.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "When it's open.\n",
      "That's about it.\n",
      "I'm aware that I'm in a high-risk group because of my age, obesity, cancer survivor, that sort of thing.\n",
      "Although, I don't think I'm immunosuppressive, I'm just not on an aromatase inhibitor now.\n",
      "Never had to do chemo.\n",
      "Cancer-lite, it was really nice.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you're going to get cancer, that is a good, is it good to get cancer-lite.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah, it was intraductal carcinoma, but on diagnosis with the core biopsies, it's staged out as a zero.\n",
      "Then after surgery, it was a one.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great, I'm so happy it was caught.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "I just opted, let's have bilateral mastectomies, and I know you're not going to sling a flap, I'm too old to deal with all that.\n",
      "We did implants, and that was it.\n",
      "No radiation, no chemo.\n",
      "That's why I call it lite.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm so glad that they caught it so early, that's wonderful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, it sounds like you have a wide variety of items.\n",
      "So it might be hard to find enough space to give each item or each group its own place.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But actually, that would be a good use of my time.\n",
      "If I could spend a day, perhaps talk to someone else about categorizations, like where do I keep things like binoculars and earphones and so forth, purses, keeping emergency candles and collectibles and decorative things.\n",
      "I have about 200 buttons from over the years, which I collected.\n",
      "And I have a rainbow flag with kind of the skyline of Seattle with the Space Needle in the middle.\n",
      "And so I hung that on my wall, and it proved to be a perfect place to pin all of the pins, buttons I've collected over the years from the '70s until present.\n",
      "So it's a combination of [inaudible 00:33:12] is good.\n",
      "And I have one button that says Monday, with a bar across it.\n",
      "No Mondays please, various candidates for office, organizations I belong to, souvenirs from bars or anniversary parties, campaigns, no on 335, yes on seven.\n",
      "You name it.\n",
      "It's lots of different things that kind of reflect my history of both involvement and also what kind of pins and what was I willing to put on my body at the time.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:34:15]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And it sounds, so it sounds like you-\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Political as well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I live the items that you're keeping.\n",
      "It seems like they have a lot of value to you, both for remembering but also remembering why you do those things in the first place or reminding you of what you believe in.\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So how do you decide if your behavior of collecting or of saving items is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 34:\n",
      "Well, part of it is deciding when you're looking at say, something like moving, where you really want to try to minimizing the stuff you have to move.\n",
      "Some of it is knowing why you value certain things and why you keep them.\n",
      "And some of it is well, just things get old and break.\n",
      "So that's fine.\n",
      "Or you get inspired and you clean up a room or clear out that closet and make it look like new.\n",
      "It's well organizing.\n",
      "It's a matter of spending the hour of whatever it takes to do that.\n",
      "And I think a lot of time, some are sitting at the computer, watching television and Bs'ing with people.\n",
      "And you know, we're all staying home because of the virus.\n",
      "It's hard to find that 15 to 60 minutes it's going to take to clear out that closet or reorganize those drawers, check the expiration dates on food in your refrigerator.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "It just takes a little bit of time that we often don't think we have.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok. Ok. Uhm the next kind of prompt that we have-- So in the DSM-5 its written “This difficulty is due to perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them.”\n",
      "So how do you make a determination of how much distress is normal or abnormal?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm lets see-- Probably based on uhm-- I mean most things that we do in any area of the DSM, we have to do based on kind of like a scale of, you know, no distress at all to extreme distress.\n",
      "And so, it is subjective, of course, to an extent.\n",
      "But if someone says that “well it’s not really difficult for me, it just causes me a little bit of anxiety or a little bit of sadness or a little bit of distress, but it goes away pretty quickly,” then you know, that’s not, you know, that’s not too worrisome.\n",
      "But if it’s that they imagine that the distress that they would experience would be quite high and they don’t wanna, you know, try that out at all- that that would be more problematic.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Uhm just to jump in—uh sorry Interviewer 2-- Just as a follow up to that, sorry-- Also I’m still here, I’m just listening along.\n",
      "Uhm the next part of our interview is going to turn to kind of the question of insight in hoarding disorder; and I kind of wanted to follow up on what you just said to see how that relates to insight.\n",
      "Like, do patients who have less insight about their disorder sometimes have trouble expressing their distress?\n",
      "Or do you have trouble measuring it in those cases?\n",
      "Or is the distress always apparent, as a feature regardless of insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm I think the distress is usually pretty apparent as a feature, like in terms of how bothersome it is for them to actually get rid of something.\n",
      "The insight part, I think, comes more along with like ‘How much does it actually interfere with their lives?’ and ‘How much does it, as a whole, give them the distress having it as a problem?’ Whereas the momentary distress that comes up while discarding is, um I think, is fairly apparent for most people.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Uh so kind of leading into that next section, we wanted to talk a little bit about insight in hoarding disorder so, how do you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well the awareness that someone has into some sort of problematic behavior, I guess.\n",
      "Uhm yeah--Their just general awareness of how much something is problematic and causes them kind of objective- objective problems in their functioning, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: And usually that’s like, you know, being objective in comparison to someone else’s point of view.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "We like our small house.\n",
      "We like that it doesn't take long to vacuum or that we don't have a big heating bill or things like that, but it's just a question of how do we get organized, how do we have something that we could be proud to have somebody sit in our living room instead of what we currently have.\n",
      "How do we get there?\n",
      "Of course, it's all the time.\n",
      "I work 40 hours a week.\n",
      "I have elderly parents in Maryland who I'm constantly going down to visit.\n",
      "Part of the reason why I get involved in these studies is because my mom has Alzheimer's and my grandmother had Alzheimer's.\n",
      "I feel like I'm next in line for it.\n",
      "It's the Alzheimer's groups that I'm a part of that connect me through to these studies.\n",
      "It's a question...\n",
      "Time is also in very short supply, so even though it seems like it should be reasonable to get ourselves into a better place, into a more beautiful household environment, it never happens in reality.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, there's always so many things competing for our time.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thinking about areas that are cluttered, are there specific parts of your home that you would consider cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Almost every room I would say with perhaps exception of the bathroom.\n",
      "Our kitchen, we try to do a good job in.\n",
      "The kitchen is okay except of course that there's always a stack of papers by my seat of things that I have kept to review over breakfast or whatever, which I should do something about that.\n",
      "Yeah, I guess there's a few areas that are the least cluttered areas.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, the bathroom and the kitchen?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there parts of your home that you don't use?\n",
      "It sounds like there's not-\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "The basement.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The basement?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "I didn't catch that last part.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "Are there parts of your home that you don't use or that you don't use the way they're intended?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Most of the clutter is in the basement.\n",
      "As my kids grow up, we're hoping to make that into a more usable place.\n",
      "Right now, our basement pretty much solely is for storage, but we're hoping to clear that out and make it to a bigger play space for them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so making a nice place for them to play.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Going back to the different things that you have, as far as you have these inherited, gifted things, things that you might use, but may be considered valueless to others and then these books that you were talking about, how important are those things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "How important are they to do what at home?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just to make you feel at home.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: NAME [27:58] do you want to take over with the next section?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah so, it kind of leads us into the next section of the interview, which is talking about the DSM 5 criteria for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "We know that you had a hand in kind of crafting those criteria; and so are there particular elements of the criteria that you regard as difficult to apply, kind of similar to that distinction that we were talking about where the clutter invades certain areas of the home or certain living space.\n",
      "So are there elements that you regard as difficult to apply or that you see different clinicians may apply differently?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah…I think, I think that one is certainly one that’s a little difficult to apply because you got to make a judgement about interference and distress and if there’s no clutter or little clutter in the living areas of the home.\n",
      "Does that rule a person out for the diagnosis, and I think that is a bit problematic.\n",
      "I do, I do know, thinking more about that question, I do have one case in particular where there’s relatively little clutter but the scoop velocity about the disposition of possessions is so severe that the person is nearly incapacitated.\n",
      "So that’s a difficult piece I think of the diagnostic criteria.\n",
      "The other part that I think is a little bit misunderstood and you probably create some difficulty in making diagnosis, has to do with the specifier of acquisition, excessive acquisition.\n",
      "Based on our research, we find that well over 90% of people have excessive acquisition, but it’s difficult sometimes to assess it because people often either have a hard time recognizing when they’re acquisition is excessive or they answer the question based on the fact that they have attempted to control and are somewhat successful controlling the acquisition by avoiding triggers to acquiring.\n",
      "And the difficulty with that is that those triggers can be avoided very successfully over a long period of time.\n",
      "So someone can gain some short-term control over the acquisition by avoidance but in the long-run it’s still a problem because they can’t keep up that avoidance for very long.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. So now we want to ask you some specific questions about the way you think about the DSM 5 criteria, and we both know that you probably know them much better than we do, but we just want to read you a phrase from the criteria and then get to know a little more of your thought process as you apply it to patients.\n",
      "So…\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Not really because I'm involved in a lot of organizations, but we've pretty much, a lot of things we do by Zoom meetings, and [inaudible 00:52:04] Normally we go a lot to concerts and theater, and so we're not able to do that, but I don't feel real deprived.\n",
      "My husband, to tell the truth, he'd be perfectly happy if he can just stay home and watch golf on TV and take naps.\n",
      "And go putter in the backyard, trim the bushes so it really hasn't, it's really not much different at all, except for him, I think he sort of likes it because I'm home more, but and it hasn't...\n",
      "Even though I can't do a lot of things I used to, I haven't felt any stress because of it, and I think being retired, if I were younger, I would be... I mean I can't imagine what it's like.\n",
      "One of the people in one of the organizations that I'm with, she just went off to college.\n",
      "Her end of her senior year, she didn't get to do any of the things that you normally do your senior year, and going off to college, even though she did physically go to, actually I think she went [inaudible 00:53:28] and as far as I know she's still there, but for somebody who is retired, you don't have to worry about losing your job or finding another job or juggling working at home with having kids at home.\n",
      "I feel like older people, well I think if you have someone else in the household, older people really can't complain if they someone else in the household.\n",
      "I do feel bad for some of my friends are single, and I think it's harder for them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, but you in particular, you haven't really noticed any sorts of impacts?\n",
      "How about with your acquiring habits?\n",
      "Like buying things or acquiring things for free, has that been changed at all due to COVID?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "No, I don't think it's changed a lot.\n",
      "I probably have bought... I don't normally buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, but I have lately.\n",
      "Just things that we need, just because it's easier than going to the hardware store or something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "How about your difficulties with throwing things out?\n",
      "Has being in the house more made that easier or made it harder?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Well, I think of somebody who's just obsessive about a certain object and who compulsively collects, purchases, or however comes by that object...\n",
      "Let's see...\n",
      "To the point of it interfering with healthy normal living in their living space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so when it starts to interfere with their daily life is when you could consider it hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, for the next couple questions, I'm going to read you a situation and then I'm going to ask you if you think this person exhibits more hoarding disorder tendencies or more just clutter problems.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized but is usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "So, do you think this person depicts more hoarding disorder or more clutter problem behavior?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And do you think this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "No, I don't think it sounded like it was a problem other than just not remembering where he put his car keys or glasses or whatever it was you said that he had to look for.\n",
      "It didn't sound very bad to me, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, then you would think that this behavior does not require treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and is this behavior similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, it's similar to mine, but yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, how do you see similarities?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Hmm. I will say yes just kind of sort of not a huge amount.\n",
      "But yes because I just...\n",
      "Again I feel like I have more time and less going on in my life that gives me more space so I need to work on this problem and make some changes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And I know that you feel more socially isolated now because of the pandemic.\n",
      "But prior to COVID-19, did you feel lonely?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes, mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and have you experienced any conflicts during the coronavirus?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "A conflict?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, like either with other people or with yourself.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, well I mentioned that two of my sisters are having what I think are some pretty whacked out ideas about who's orchestrating the COVID pandemic thing or whatever.\n",
      "And so, I guess I could say there's a little bit of conflict there but we pretty much just don't talk about it.\n",
      "And other than that, when I do go out to go shopping or whatever...\n",
      "When you've got to do that sometimes, I forget...\n",
      "Very often I forget to put the mask on before I get into the store or when I'm walking from the parking lot to the store it's like, \"Oh, darn.\n",
      "I've got to go back to my car and get the mask.\"\n",
      "So, I mean that's my own inner conflict because I really... I mean who likes wearing them?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Gross.\n",
      "They're a pain, yeah, to put on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, okay.\n",
      "So, that was actually all the questions I had for you.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, now I just need to collect some demographic information and then collect some information in order for you to get your gift card, and then we'll be all done.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, as for demographics, your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Sorry, say it again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your sex assigned at birth.\n",
      "So, female or male.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You're good.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Cell phones aren't the clearest things for [crosstalk 01:10:33].\n",
      "But anyway.\n",
      "Yeah, female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And do you still identify as female?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, your race?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "White, Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic and or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Your household income?\n",
      "You can just give me a general range.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I think it's about 50,000 a year.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your geographic region?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Pacific Northwest of United States, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "A college degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is that a bachelor's?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "A bachelor's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then now I just need information in order for you to receive your gift card.\n",
      "So, do you have a preference for physical or electronic gift card?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "I don't have a preference.\n",
      "It doesn't matter to me.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "So that's how I did this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you think that ties into ...\n",
      "Because you seem to have a very minimalist view on the items that you intentionally acquire.\n",
      "Is it the items that you have that have accumulated?\n",
      "Are those items that are mostly given to you by others?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "That is [inaudible 01:05:34].\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That was something I probably should've clarified earlier on.\n",
      "But, we got the gist throughout the whole interview of that.\n",
      "I have a couple more questions if you still have a few more minutes?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes, I do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It seems like during this time, the past four months, you've found comfort in exercise as well as your volunteer work.\n",
      "Is that true and also is there anything else that's brought you comfort?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "That is true.\n",
      "And yes, my dog.\n",
      "I don't know how I would've made it this far without my dog, because I adore her.\n",
      "She's a six pound teacup poodle.\n",
      "And like right now, she's sitting on my lap.\n",
      "She always wants to be with me, and when I'm needing a hug, I just lift her up to my chest, and just tell her, \"I have to have a hug.\"\n",
      "So she has brought me the most comfort for sure.\n",
      "I do make a phone call to someone almost every day, because that's my way of connecting to people.\n",
      "And I talk on FaceTime to some family and friends.\n",
      "So, that has helped me.\n",
      "... Was that the question?\n",
      "I'm sorry, was the question, how am I-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How are you finding comfort during this time?\n",
      "Which was very general and you've answered it very thoroughly.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So you mentioned your exercise, your volunteer work, that you're staying in touch with friends and family, like probably about once a day.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Well one person, I make sure I call ...\n",
      "It's not always the same person.\n",
      "I'll choose someone to call.\n",
      "The other thing is that brings me a lot of joy actually is sometimes we have driveway meetings in the neighborhood.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I love that.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Not enough, because it's so hot.\n",
      "But before it got this hot, we did it a little more often.\n",
      "Sometimes we would bring our own chair and drink, and we would do our distancing in the driveway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "It's not happening as much, but whenever it can happen, I'm right there.\n",
      "So those are the things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is awesome to hear about the sense of community there, that people want to do that.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah, there's a lot of nice people in my neighborhood.\n",
      "I'm lucky.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And I have one more question for you, and that relates to, did you feel lonely or isolated prior to quarantine happening?\n",
      "And then following quarantine, has that feeling changed?\n",
      "Saw the waffle maker sitting there, and I'm going, okay, I've got a empty trash, take my trash bag out.\n",
      "I'm going to take that waffle maker and when I take the trash out, I'm going to put the waffle maker out on the garage sale shelf.\n",
      "Great, it's done.\n",
      "It's gone.\n",
      "You don't really notice, oh, this is space reclaimed, because there's still so much crap there.\n",
      "It's almost like I have to sneak up on it, and not, okay, this is what I'm going to do right here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you don't have problems making the decision that you don't need something anymore, it's everything that comes after that, that's the problem.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Basically, that's it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think about your home, what would you say are the most important or valuable to you items in your home?\n",
      "Again, this doesn't mean necessarily monetarily valuable, but when you think about all of the different things that you have, which things are most important to you?\n",
      "What is the most, I hate to even put this in people's head, but if you were in danger of losing your stuff, what would be the stuff that you'd go for first, that you would say, this is the thing I need to save?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "My computer.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The computer, for sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How come your computer, because you use it so often?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's my lifeline.\n",
      "It's the way I communicate.\n",
      "It's a time suck.\n",
      "I have all my valuable papers and documents.\n",
      "Not all, but I've got my life on it.\n",
      "Online registration forms, software licenses, tax records, all that sort of thing.\n",
      "It's all there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Any other items that you go to in your mind as, that's a thing I would really miss if I lost it?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Jewelry.\n",
      "It's not all jewelry, it's just things that are special to me, like maybe jewelry that I have made.\n",
      "Special pieces that represent, for example, when I traveled all the time, I would build up the American Express points, and had always admired one particular jewelry, LAGOS Jewelry.\n",
      "I would use my points to buy pieces.\n",
      "That's valuable to me.\n",
      "It's also things that I can pass down.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your granddaughter.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has your problems with clutter ever gotten in the way of your important relationships?\n",
      "Do you feel like this is upsetting for people around you?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm sure that it is, but we don't talk about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You don't talk about it with your son?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "No. Because he and my daughter-in-law have a lot of stuff around.\n",
      "But, my daughter-in-law helps keep it under control.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "He also saves a lot.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "They've got a tighter space, but Tara helps Jeff keep the clutter down.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "He also can be very cluttered, but she's got her to help her with that.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "030\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We're recording.\n",
      "For the first part of this interview, I just want to ask before we begin talking about everything, what term do you prefer when we're talking about your issues with clutter or your hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I don't think I'm a serious hoarder, you know, like you see on those TV shows, but I definitely have a clutter problem, and I definitely could see if it got worse, it could become more serious.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you want to just use the word clutter problems then?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "That's going to conclude the first little section of the interview.\n",
      "Now we're going to have more of a general conversation about how your clutter problems began.\n",
      "That's actually the first question I'm going to ask.\n",
      "Can you remember a point where your clutter problems began or maybe like why or when it started in your life?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "It was probably when, maybe when I was in my 30s.\n",
      "A lot of the clutter was related to sewing and craft and hobbies.\n",
      "Sometimes for sewing I like to go fabric shopping, and I would see something I really liked, and then get home and never get around to doing anything with it, and that would happen over and over, and pretty soon I have boxes and boxes of fabric, and kind of the same thing with other craft supplies.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Was that mostly like in your early or late teens and early 20s or like maybe in college, as well?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Probably like mid-30s.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mid-30s is when you would say it sort of began?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about now?\n",
      "How has it changed throughout your life?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Well I moved to a different state 10 years ago so I did get rid of a lot of stuff, but I've sort of found it creeping back up again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is it generally the same sorts of things, like the sewing or have you kind of acquired more things in different categories?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Mostly craft kind of things, and I also have a lot of papers, around the house.\n",
      "I'm involved in, I've been involved in several organizations, and it seems like I go to meetings, and there's papers and I guess I'm always afraid to throw things out because I might need it so I have a lot of papers piled up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Have you ever gone to a professional, say, for help?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I don't think I need that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you see it as sort of like a problem in your life or just kind of a mild inconvenience?\n",
      "033\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The first several questions will be...\n",
      "All the questions will be about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding.\n",
      "Do you have a preferred term for that?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, not really.\n",
      "Clutter's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Now, we'll go into some other types of questions that aren't necessarily about listing.\n",
      "They're just an open kind of question.\n",
      "Some of them will be a little bit more personal and some not so much.\n",
      "The first one is just about your clutter problems.\n",
      "Can you describe them for me and how long they've been going on?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "I've always had something of this mentality for as long as I can remember.\n",
      "Even as a kid, I remember finding rocks and just wanting to collect and accumulate them.\n",
      "Then that rock would become associated with a place or a memory and so I couldn't throw it out.\n",
      "I think that these have been happening forever.\n",
      "If anything, maybe I've gotten a little bit better because I've recognized it as a ridiculous aspect of myself.\n",
      "Of course, my husband says that I can't possibly keep everything that I want to keep.\n",
      "So I think it's probably gotten better more recently, but yeah, it's always been there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What kinds of things do you keep?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I'd say that there's two sections of items that I keep.\n",
      "One is the stuff that I have inherited or been gifted by other people in my life.\n",
      "Usually that is stuff that is important to me, things like artwork from relatives or, I don't know, decorated plates.\n",
      "Usually, they're kind of these decorated things that are beautiful and they remind me of a person and so I keep them, but I have no place to put them.\n",
      "So I put them in the basement with the stuff carefully packaged away.\n",
      "Then the second kind of thing I keep is the stuff that may have a use, so I have... but it's really valueless.\n",
      "The stuff that people give me usually has a value, but the stuff that I keep that...\n",
      "It usually is something I can imagine a project with it.\n",
      "I work with Girl Scouts and of course they're very big into using resources wisely, so sometimes I look at something that I'm about to throw away and I think, \"Oh, but I could use this for X.\" Then I wind up getting a big disorganized stack of it usually in my basement because that's the least frequented place in my house.\n",
      "Usually, it's one of those... defaulted to those two categories.\n",
      "I've a very hard time getting rid of books.\n",
      "That's one thing that I have a hard time getting rid of all that, but at least those stay on a shelf and they're not too intrusive I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. That is what I mean.\n",
      "Is there any like big event or anything you ever wanted as far as work, that you weren't able to get because of either losing something within the mess, or not able to invite people over?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No. I've never had to miss, but having people come in.\n",
      "That would be the only thing I can think of.\n",
      "And kind of like I said, like how I wanted to get over what I'm doing with now like, \"Okay, I can't let this continue.\"\n",
      "So fortunately the depression seized and I got help, and I got medication, and I was able to deal with things.\n",
      "So I had a mother who was very depressed, and it gave me a model of what I didn't want to have my life be like.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has-\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "She just went potty.\n",
      "Now I got to pick her up and get back in the house.\n",
      "Sorry, go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, you are all good.\n",
      "So now I want to ask you a few questions about value of the items that you have.\n",
      "When you think about what you keep.\n",
      "What makes those items valuable?\n",
      "And how do you determine if it is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "It's mainly the person who gave me the item, or who's item it was that I inherited.\n",
      "I'm going to close the garage door now.\n",
      "... Okay, that's the main thing.\n",
      "I do have some items from my grandmother, so they're like 100 years old, and they have some monetary value.\n",
      "But, I just donated a couple of those things to a church auction last year.\n",
      "So it's not based on the monetary value, really.\n",
      "But there are some things that I don't want to put in a thrift store box because it just has too much monetary value.\n",
      "Most of the stuff though, I really don't want to let go of, is the actual truth.\n",
      "But like when I donated the things to the church auction, they were like, \"Are you sure you want to donate this?\" I'm like, \"Yes.\"\n",
      "It was something that even though I had the memory, and I knew who it was from.\n",
      "I didn't have a place to put it, I didn't really like it that much.\n",
      "Stuff like that, I thought, \"Okay, you need to start to let these things go.\"\n",
      "But keep in mind, I've probably had them for 40 years.\n",
      "So I'm trying to use a slow process to let the things go.\n",
      "That's definitely not based on their monetary value.\n",
      "It can be a small thing, and I just love it because I remember the friend who gave it to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you have a most precious item in your home?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "One?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And have you felt anymore attached, or it's harder to get rid of items during this period of being in your home more?\n",
      "Or going through these item\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "It's gotten a little bit better, because I mentioned before, I have like five boxes in the garage that are going to go to charity, whenever that's possible.\n",
      "So I just try to keep, I think, I don't really need this anymore.\n",
      "Something that I'm trying out is using it one more time, or if it's a household item, and thinking, \"Does this really matter?\n",
      "Could I have used this other thing instead of this thing?\" And then I'm like, \"Yeah, you can put that in the charity box.\"\n",
      "The same thing with clothes, I've put something on, I think, let me wear this today and see how it feels.\n",
      "And then I think, if this didn't feel every good, I put it in the laundry, and then I put it in the charity pile.\n",
      "The clothes are in a spare bedroom in a pile that I'm piling those up.\n",
      "I didn't want to put those in the garage.\n",
      "So that's how I'm doing it, and I would say it is a little easier.\n",
      "I don't know if it's because I'm spending so much time with my things.\n",
      "I am trying to identify that they're not as important as have had ...\n",
      "They don't have the importance I had attached to them, is what I'm trying to make myself think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When did you start trying that, \"I'll use it one more time.\"\n",
      "Or, \"I'll wear it one more time, and see if it's something that I really need.\"\n",
      "Approach?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Since March 12th, when I started to quarantine, and I was just here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What made you take that approach?\n",
      "Like what gave you the idea to do that, in the first place?\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Well, I'm by myself most of the time.\n",
      "I mean I do go outside.\n",
      "I take a walk every morning, and I do walk my dog.\n",
      "I take her out.\n",
      "So I am outside, but I'm not doing anything social, and I think it started with the clothes probably.\n",
      "And because I read a lot of stuff, and I think, \"Does this look really good?\n",
      "Does it make me feel good?\n",
      "Is this too old?\n",
      "Does it have too many pills?\" I think, \"I'll wear it today and see.\"\n",
      "I think that's how it started.\n",
      "And then I thought, \"I can do that with some of my kitchen items too.\"\n",
      "Like I used a pot for something to cook something, and I thought, \"I have this other pot, I could also have cooked this in.\n",
      "I don't really need this.\"\n",
      "So I put that in.\n",
      "That's how it started.\n",
      "The one more use of nothing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I like it.\n",
      "It's an approach.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Yeah, I never read that anywhere.\n",
      "That's my own.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You should trademark that.\n",
      "Do something.\n",
      "Participant 29:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Well you can feel free to use it if it comes up anywhere you have the opportunity.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. And how aware are typical patients that they have hoarding disorder when you first see them?\n",
      "And how did that, kind of, change over time?\n",
      "Interviewee: So, in terms of the actual-- I’d say both with treatment and in research, people are at least somewhat aware that its problematic and that that’s what it is.\n",
      "That when they read about it or when its explained to them, they kind of agree that “oh yeah, this makes sense, that is just what it’s like for me.”\n",
      "So yeah, they probably-- But some people definitely don’t really totally connect with it at first.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, we talked a little bit about the role that family and friends play in bringing in people for treatment sometimes, or kind of triggering that drive to seek help.\n",
      "Are there specific relatives that are more often involved than others, in your experience?\n",
      "Interviewee: Often times, adult children or-- Like usually spouses don’t seem to be so- well like, the spouses often are either not that bothered by it or have their own kind of problems with it, to some extent.\n",
      "And its oftentimes close family members, like a sibling or a child- usually once they’re an adult, are the ones I’d say are most common; because most other family members you can more easily keep at bay, where they’re not coming into their house, necessarily.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "And so, do you feel that like these family members, you said often the adult children, what role do you think they play in arriving at that diagnosis of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "What maybe that you confer with initially to learn the extent of things or…\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, you know often times if someone- especially if someone isn’t totally on board with it, then they’re coming in with someone else- with a family member perhaps, or the family member might call and make the initial inquiries.\n",
      "And so, the children are often going to be the ones who do that.\n",
      "And sometimes, you know, people just want to know how they talk to their parent or how do they-- Once in a while it will be the parents of the hoarder, but that’s not as common especially cause their parents are likely- you know, by the time it gets really bad, the parents may not even be living anymore depending uhm…\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "But it seems like the social surrounding of the individual does play a really strong role in either coming in for treatment or the driver behind them seeking help.\n",
      "So, it does seem like a fairly important part of arriving at this diagnosis for the individual or beginning treatment for an individual.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: But, what happens when you are… when you have tried and failed at something?\n",
      "You consider yourself a failure.\n",
      "You can do some sort of mental protective activities, and one of them is to define the problem away.\n",
      "And so, I can define this as just the way I live, and maybe the way I want to live.\n",
      "And so, if that’s the case, they’re not likely to define it as a mental problem, and they’re not likely to talk about it having a biological cause.\n",
      "It’s just the way they are.\n",
      "But if they think of it as a mental problem, then what’s the easiest way of thinking about it?\n",
      "Well, it’s not my character, it’s some sort of disease.\n",
      "So, I think the explanation is kind of tied up with where they’re at with respect to insight.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, that’s interesting.\n",
      "And, do you… have you found or do you have any speculation as to which group would be easier to treat, of those two groups?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think the treatment starts in a different place.\n",
      "If you understand the disease, I think you start a little farther along in the process.\n",
      "If you are still struggling with recognition and, you know, are defensive about it, then I think you have to start in a different place, and get them to focus on what the impact this behavior has on my life.\n",
      "And only after doing that for a while can you really see that, this is something I need to do something about.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "And in… so it’s almost along a spectrum where considering it as a character trait may be kind of a little further behind the individual who’s thinking of it as a biological disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Do you feel like in the path to treatment every individual has to come to the point where they feel that it’s a biological disorder?\n",
      "Can there be [INAUDIBLE 8:37] that they just need to [INAUDIBLE 8:40].\n",
      "Interviewee: No, no, I think… Yeah, I think it can be looked at easily, the problem-solving exercise, that “here’s the problem I’ve got, I’ve got to solve it.”\n",
      "And you don’t really need to go into why.\n",
      "So, I think it helps people to think of it as biological in the sense that they don’t feel blamed by it, they don’t feel maybe as much shame, but I don’t know if that’s true for everyone but for a lot of people, I think.\n",
      "And a lot of people come into treatment and want to know why, and of course we don’t have a very good answer to that.\n",
      "And the biological one is an easy one to say because it’s sort of like a black box explanation, it doesn’t really say anything, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "P3: It there anything you’d like to know before we get started?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh not at this point.\n",
      "P3: Okay so um our informed consent: your volunteering to participate in our research project conducted by NAME (6:27) from UNIVERSITY (6:29).\n",
      "The aim of this study is to better understand the ways that researchers and clinicians think about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "You’ll be one of approximately thirty people being interviewed for this research, your participation in this project is voluntary, you will not be paid for your participation.\n",
      "You may withdraw and discontinue participation at any time without prenatally, if you decline to participate or withdraw from the study no one will be told.\n",
      "Most interviewees will find the discussion interesting and thought provoking, if however, you feel uncomfortable in any way during the interview you have the right to decline to answer any question or to end the interview.\n",
      "Um so participation in this study involves being interviewed by researchers from UNIVERSITY (7:05), the interview will last approximately sixty minutes and we’ll take notes during the interview, um we also plan to make an audio tape of the interview and um the subsequent dialog will be transcribed.\n",
      "Um if you don’t want to be taped you will not be able to participate in the study.\n",
      "Um the researchers will not identify you by name in any of the reports using any of the information that came from this interview and your confidentially as a participant and in the study will remain secure.\n",
      "Subsequent uses of our records and data will be subject to the standard data use policies, which protect the anonymity of individual or institutions faculty and administrators from my campus will be neither present at your interview nor have access to log notes or transcripts, um this precaution will prevent you individual comments from having any negative reproductions’.\n",
      "This research study has been approved by the institutional review board at UNIVERSITY (7:52) and I am happy to send you um any contact information the IRB and for the PI at the end of this interview.\n",
      "Um do you have any questions for me about any of that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm nope.\n",
      "P3: Okay that’s fine, so um now we're done with the listing component of the interview, I appreciate you doing that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "As far as valuable financially, for the most part, no. Anything that's financially valuable is in a protective place of its own.\n",
      "Some art glass vases and that sort of thing, I keep in the china cabinet.\n",
      "They're in a place where they're safe.\n",
      "Other things that I value, because of the memories associated with them.\n",
      "A lot of the art that I have on the walls, things like oh, my aunt did this series of watercolors, that sort of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Some of it has sentimental value.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Some of it has monetary value.\n",
      "The stuff that you consider to be monetarily valuable is more put away, and the stuff that you think is more sentimentally valuable is more out?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's not that the monetarily valuable things are put away, they're just protected a little bit better.\n",
      "Like my crystal and china, and the art glass stuff, they're out on display.\n",
      "The silver, which I value because it was my mother's silver set, and then another thing that was my grandmother's, I keep those put away, because it's so that, to protect it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "In other words, if a service person comes into the house, I don't want them to be aware that-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You have valuable silver, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "... I own ...\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "Just to protect it and keep it out of sight.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about when you're going through your stuff and you're making decisions about when it's time to throw something away, when do you decide to throw stuff away?\n",
      "What is that decision making process like for you?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Gosh, I haven't made that decision in so long, that's why I've got a problem.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "God.\n",
      "Inertia.\n",
      "It's so weird, I will develop, I'll go okay, here's how I'm going to throw stuff away.\n",
      "This is going to go to such and such place, this goes into the trash, this goes into the recycle, this goes into the next time we have a garage sale shelf in the garage.\n",
      "I'll spend so much time trying to get organized, that actually, carrying out the plan never happens.\n",
      "Or, it'll start, but then I've either made the plan so complicated, or whatever, that I never finish it up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's not that you never have the-\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "It's mostly, it's about, what's the disposition of this stuff.\n",
      "What I've started doing is just randomly, Lord, I'd never use this anymore.\n",
      "Why do I have it here?\n",
      "This happened with the, I have a waffle maker.\n",
      "It was a regular little single purpose waffle maker, and then I went, oh, I sure do like paninis, and I got one of those, you can make paninis on it, you can make waffles, et cetera.\n",
      "I have duplicate things.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah, well, for a while it did because we couldn't drop stuff off at the donation centers.\n",
      "I was sort of keeping stuff that I felt might have a use for donation centers, but then we did that whole yard sale thing.\n",
      "After we did the yard sale, the donation centers were open at that point, so we just deposited everything that we thought might be of value, and we threw everything else away.\n",
      "The donation centers were still restricted in what they were accepting.\n",
      "For instance, they did not accept furniture, or else we would have given them that futon.\n",
      "I guess the one thing COVID changed was since there were restrictions, we started realizing we just had to throw things away because there was no way people were going to casually pick something up anymore.\n",
      "Everything would have to be able to be sanitized or cleaned in some way before anyone would accept it.\n",
      "When you realize that, then you're more likely to throw something away I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "People are not...\n",
      "Are at least more cautious about taking things from other people.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you had any more time for organizing?\n",
      "It sounds like you're still fairly busy.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, we're as busy as ever.\n",
      "In fact, I somewhat jealously see everyone online talking about all the spare time and what are they going to do with it.\n",
      "I'm like, \"Boy, I could fill your spare time with half a dozen things.\"\n",
      "Decluttering is only one of them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, but it could be one of them.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Looking at its impacts just generally again, has COVID-19 had any impact on your overall physical health?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about any impacts on your overall mental health or wellbeing?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Not mine personally.\n",
      "I mean it increases worry for my parents and of course, as I said, my dad got very anxious about it.\n",
      "I had to sort of mediate his anxiety as well, but I feel like, personally, I'm not excessively worried about it.\n",
      "It's something that just I feel like has to run its course.\n",
      "I mean we do what we can.\n",
      "I think that it's really important to socially distance as much as possible and wear your mask.\n",
      "I'm really fortunate that I work in an environment where I have my own office.\n",
      "I can sort of shut myself off from most people a lot of the time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "But I don't see a point in getting really worked up about COVID.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you found that there's any coping techniques that are helpful or no?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No. Nothing recently.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Just making sure I have everything.\n",
      "Just in general...\n",
      "It's okay if you don't have an answer for this or anything, but where do you generally seek comfort from?\n",
      "From others, possessions, something different.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah. Well, the other thing that’s important there related to that, not so much that it’s difficult, but... is the fact that the other pieces of this puzzle point to the possibility that what we’re looking at here is a form of giftedness.\n",
      "And that giftedness has to do with, number one, the ability to see the beauty in the physical world and appreciate the beauty in the physical world.\n",
      "Lots of collecting behaviors are associated with aesthetically pleasing objects and not wanting to waste that aesthetic in that object.\n",
      "And so, one of the most frequent things people collect are things that are designed for some kind of arts and crafts project.\n",
      "And the difficulty is people see the potential for the aesthetic value of an object and they collect it with the intention of producing something, some kind of work of art or craft of some kind.\n",
      "But they don’t have the organizational skills to really get that done, and so in some ways it’s an aesthetic gone awry.\n",
      "And the other piece of the giftedness is this ability to make associations with objects.\n",
      "So, if I see a bottle cap without a bottle my only association is trash and how do I get rid of it, but people with hoarding problems will see the shape and the color and the texture and think about things they could do to bring out those colors and make that even more aesthetically pleasing.\n",
      "So, it’s almost as though… one of the people in our book Stuff described his brain as a tree with too many branches that every thought leads somewhere and leads him down a different path and there are so many branches that he gets lost.\n",
      "And so, it’s a combination of maybe an intense form of intelligence together with sort of an aesthetic giftedness that can’t be controlled.\n",
      "It can’t be corralled somehow to make it workable.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Wow.\n",
      "Interviewee: I’m not sure that that answered your question, but [INAUDIBLE 35:13]\n",
      "Interviewer 1: No, I think it was definitely one of the more interesting concepts that you mentioned in your book, Stuff.\n",
      "Both [NAME 35:20] and I have read it and I think for me that was one of the most interesting things about it, because in the literature it’s not really discussed, the positive aspects of this behavior or this illness.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I think here is a place to begin talking about this that would encourage people with this problem to come forward, because one of the things they describe is this feeling of being disrespected.\n",
      "And I think that has a lot to do with not coming forward to try to work on this problem or admit this problem.\n",
      "But if we respect them for what they are good at, then they are likely to be able to come forward a little more readily to say, “Well, what are the downsides of this?” And so, I think that may be a place, that may be a hook to get at this issue of why people may be reluctant to come in for treatment, especially before they get to be 50 or 60 years old, which is when we, most of the time, see people coming in after decades of doing this.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. So, the next phrase that we have for you is “the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.”\n",
      "So how much stuff counts as cluttered space?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "So, I would say if it can’t be removed from the space in a few minutes then, like I mean, to at least be relocated to another space.\n",
      "So, if there’s a bunch of stuff on a coffee table it might take them… it might take a normal person, I don’t know, 20 or 30 minutes to actually sort through everything and like get- put everything in its complete proper place; but it would probably only take two or three minutes for them to move it to another location-- Whereas, or a minute to move it to another location if they didn’t have the opportunity to sort through all of -- Whereas someone who’s hoarding if they-- The volume of it would be a lot more, that it would take more time to even just move it even without sorting through it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: So that, I guess, is part of it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Does home-size play into this at all?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, sure.\n",
      "I mean, I mean-- Well yes, yes to an extent.\n",
      "So, like certainly we should be generally living in a space that-- We should be kind of modifying the amount of stuff that we have to fit in the space that we have.\n",
      "However, obviously people, you know, need bigger houses at points.\n",
      "So probably, if you think about, I don’t know, each person having a certain amount of personal-- A certain number, I guess, rooms per person or something, is a reasonable estimate for what the amount of space is appropriate.\n",
      "I don’t know exactly, but say a bedroom, or so, per person would probably be appropriate for the amount of space that they might utilize.\n",
      "When it’s a three-bedroom house and its just for one person, that’s probably a little too much unnecessary space-- That they’re not keeping their possessions down.\n",
      "[cross talk]\n",
      "Interviewee: Usually most people have a storage area of some sort.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, for healthy individuals there is some degree of variance of the free space that they like in their home.\n",
      "So, for example…\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer: Some people might want to have a clear desk while others prefer to have things out and ready to use on the desk.\n",
      "Do you think hoarding disorder could be just an extension of this variance that surpasses a socially acceptable threshold?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well but it’s no longer productive.\n",
      "Like with your example, then people would be able to actively- to easily access their things on their desk to use them.\n",
      "But with someone with hoarding it’s going to be a lot more difficult to actually find the item that they are looking for.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah. I mean, we've been together for 32 years, and he doesn't understand it, but occasionally he sees cool stuff being made with miscellaneous crap I've collected for 30-plus years, and he's like, \"Oh, you do actually use that rusty old tomato metal thing that I couldn't throw away five years ago.\"\n",
      "And the whole back of my garage is covered with stuff that, he actually brings home rusty things to me instead of flowers because I'm just so thrilled.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Aw. Participant 28:\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "He finds them in old people's yards next to their cars, or in an old farm lot, or by the side of the road he'll pick up a rusty part of a muffler and bring it home, and I'm like, \"Oh my god, that's so thoughtful.\"\n",
      "And then it goes on all of the big shelves in the back of our garage, which two of our neighbors look down on, those poor people.\n",
      "I bet they think I'm a hoarder, but that doesn't bother me because they're not important to me, and if they came and complained about it I'd feel badly.\n",
      "But they don't have the right to complain about it.\n",
      "You see?\n",
      "Like, this is a problem, but it's not ruining my life.\n",
      "I do feel bad for my kids, like when I die, the job they have to clear things out is just not fair.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You've mentioned somewhat wanting to change his behavior, and taking a few steps towards that.\n",
      "What inspired that and why would you like to change it?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Well, it's kind of about wanting to be more efficient or productive.\n",
      "For years, I had a full time job, and taking care of kids growing up, and had a part time creative job on the side, and all these different ideas of what I wanted to do someday, and now my kids are grown up and independent, I've left a full-time responsible job.\n",
      "My jewelry business is kind of in the dumps because the gallery's closed for a while, and all of the craft fairs in this area are canceled, and I'm like, \"Hey, I have all this time, I can do whatever I want.\"\n",
      "And I feel grateful every day, but it's like I have ADHD, which I may well have.\n",
      "I can't get very much completed.\n",
      "I continue to have tons of ideas and do all kinds of drawings, but there's some problem about actually following through.\n",
      "I mean, occasionally I do, and I was way better when I had less time and things I had to do.\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "Like, you have to pay your bills, and you have to take care of your kids, and you have to go to work, and then I had to make money off my jewelry business, so I made jewelry and I was efficient and productive, but the whole creative flow isn't happening now that I have all this time.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Right, yeah.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:39:23] I just have to make myself get rid of things, like boxes, but boxes are definitely something that when you need it, you really need it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'll go ahead and read this next one then.\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He is worried he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes and his house is extremely cluttered.\n",
      "Leaving it difficult for him to walk in his own house.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for all of them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "So the same questions there.\n",
      "Do you think is a full blown hoarding disorder or more like clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah, if he has to move boxes to still get into the bathroom, I'd say that's a hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And if boxes are in every room, stacked up, I'd say that's a hoarding disorder.\n",
      "If it's just boxes, it's probably not as bad, it's probably a far extreme, but yeah, if it interferes with his ability to do what he needs to do then...\n",
      "Yeah, if it's in every room, I'd say yeah, that's a full blown hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So he should try and change his behavior?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about requiring treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Do you think he would fit that category?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Possibly.\n",
      "If he could, on his own, or with the help of a friend or relative, see that he has to do something differently, I think it could be something he could deal with without professional help, but there might be underlying issues that cause him to do that, that it would be helpful to have professional help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Would you consider this behavior similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I think that's different.\n",
      "I'm not quite at the stage where I have to move things to get into the bathroom.\n",
      "I mean these aren't stacked on the floor.\n",
      "They're mostly on the tables so yeah, I think I'm [inaudible 00:42:54]\n",
      "P1: Okay, okay um and so the next one we wanted to to ask was: uh how connived that are you that you need to keep theses things, or that bad will come of discarding how do you think your patients would-\n",
      "Interviewee: How do what?\n",
      "Can you say the question again?\n",
      "P1: Yeah, no problem.\n",
      "How convinced are you that you need to keep theses things, or that something bad will come of discarding them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm I think it would depend on what what item it is, but uh i'll just imagine the the most extreme case so, the most extreme case is that they would um for example, one person keeping um her moms um uh han-hand like the check um that had her moms handwriting, um so she would she would be one hundred percent sure that she has to keep it and because if she doesn’t keep it then she won't have anything with her moms handwriting on it and uh her reasoning is, ‘this is so um this is so um so like like this is so important how can I let go of this?’, this is impossible I would never, I would never do that.\n",
      "So yeah that would be one hundred percent sure I would never get rid of it.\n",
      "P3: Mhm mhm.\n",
      "Um for the next question I want to remind you of a of the list that you generated of reasons that people give for um their hoarding behavior, like um the list included good memories, using it later, giving the object a good home, um to what extent do you think that um that theses are um closed-hook reasons for justifying a pathological need um versus actual explanations for their behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: hm.\n",
      "P3: I don’t know if that question was quite clear.\n",
      "Interviewee: um.\n",
      "P3: So do you think that theses reasons are the real reasons, or do you think these reasons are just the result of an underlying need that they have just kind of come up with to justify their um hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm yeah, yeah this is a very good question, hm, I would I would say at least half of the case this is very more conservative estimation, I would say this would be the more um uh more superficial reasons and it may and I don’t know if it's something they come up to justify the behavior, or this is a kind of like a defense mechanism for something more vulnerable deep down, yeah I um I’m thinking as I’m saying this I am remembering sometimes like several cases in the groups that I led, people would realize actually a lot of times they are they are having under the real underlying issue for example, for one person who had shared, he doesn’t know he wouldn’t know what to do with his life if he no longer has hoarding problems, its almost like now he has something to focus on and if if I don’t have to focus on this, and my problem is solved he will be facing something that’s terribly scary and I don’t know what to do with my life and so I I as I’m answering the question I’m thinking, about this example and I think there are other examples too like, its more about the emotions underlying underlying that’s probably more scary to face so they are probably more like uh um the more uh thoughts and justifications for for all this behaviors and they are thinking of ‘this is why I should keep this’ so its to not directly tough the emotions for example loss of a family member, or yeah loss of an identity of the past that they used to have when they were still working, for example, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "No, I haven't.\n",
      "In fact, I haven't really...\n",
      "The only reason why I thought of it was because the study came up on my list of Alzheimer's studies to participate in.\n",
      "I think the original study was relating hoarding disorder to Alzheimer's, but I thought I don't really know which side I fall in.\n",
      "I don't know if I really am a hoarder or not, but I'll see if they want to have me as a participant.\n",
      "I apparently fulfilled their requirements, so it sort of spilled over into this.\n",
      "It's something I didn't really think about before these studies came out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever heard of it in another context by any chance?\n",
      "I know some people have seen the TV shows.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I have not seen the TV show, but I have heard about it.\n",
      "I do remember...\n",
      "Actually, this was long before the TV show even occurred.\n",
      "I remember there was a news episode about...\n",
      "It's so long ago.\n",
      "I don't remember the specifics of it, but they were finding elderly people in the city that had nobody to take care of them.\n",
      "It was funny because the amount of...\n",
      "The one thing they had in common was the amount of stuff in their household.\n",
      "In fact, I remember this shot that they took of one women with all of her dolls.\n",
      "She had all of them... I don't know.\n",
      "20, 30 dolls lined up in a bed.\n",
      "She clearly was not very well with it.\n",
      "That had an impact on me, not just the neglect of these people, but also the amount of stuff that they had in their household.\n",
      "I think they mentioned the hoarding disorder at that point, but that's about all I can recall.\n",
      "It doesn't seem like there's a lot of emphasis on it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The next several things...\n",
      "I'm going to be reading some vignettes, some examples.\n",
      "For each of the vignettes, our person is going to be Mr. John Doe.\n",
      "We're very original in that regard.\n",
      "I just, as I'm reading it, just would like for you to think about whether or not in each story, Mr. John Doe, if you think he might have hoarding disorder or if it's more like clutter problems or if it's really neither of those things.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Probably it would, that would be helpful.\n",
      "So, I'll say yes for that one, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And do you think this behavior is similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, only the slightest bit of similarity but it's mostly different by far, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and it goes back to that bathroom situation and being able to find your...\n",
      "You're able to find your things pretty easily without being late to things?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, the essential things like wallet and car keys and that kind of thing to get to places on time, those I can find usually pretty readily because I mostly put them in the same place every time.\n",
      "Occasionally I don't, so yeah.\n",
      "Did I... I think I answered that question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Okay, two more of these little situations.\n",
      "So, John Doe has several stacks of papers that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future.\n",
      "These stacks of papers occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.\n",
      "Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "So, do you think this is more hoarding disorder or more clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, my.\n",
      "That's a tough one to call.\n",
      "I think I'm going to call that clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and why would you say clutter as opposed to more hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Maybe because it's more similar to what I do but I don't want to be a hoarder.\n",
      "Because yeah, papers...\n",
      "But I would never put papers in my shower or bathtub.\n",
      "I cannot imagine that but whatever.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Boy, I don't know.\n",
      "I'm thinking maybe I need to change my answer.\n",
      "Maybe that is hoarding even though it's paper.\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "And so, yeah I guess, yes.\n",
      "Both yes.\n",
      "Both questions, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then you did mention that this behavior is similar to your own because they were both paper.\n",
      "But are there any other similarities that you were able to gauge?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "No, really it was just the paper part of it because yeah, I mean I have paper on lots of my horizontal surfaces.\n",
      "But never...\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, okay.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I am not sure.\n",
      "I'm not sure where the line draws except I think... I imagine people with collections, that's actually where I would like to be.\n",
      "I'd like to have them organized.\n",
      "I'd like to be able to put my hands on exactly what I want when I want it.\n",
      "I'd like things to be labeled so that my kids know where they came from and what their historic significance is.\n",
      "That's what I think a collector really is, and that's what I really hope to do with the stuff that I have, that it becomes not just an item, but something that has a story with it.\n",
      "I think the way things are now that things are very disorganized, that if you asked me to get one single particular thing, I would have to open five different boxes to figure out which one it was in.\n",
      "If I needed to find information on a piece of paper, I would have to shuffle through a stack of papers to get to it.\n",
      "I think the organization is key, and probably there's some quantity, although I don't know how I would quantify that too.\n",
      "I mean if you want to have one of every kind of something, that's collecting, but when you have to have every single one of something, then that's hoarding, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah, quantity and then the organization sound like to the the main difference there.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know that you mentioned earlier that you've never been diagnosed with something like hoarding disorder, but I think you said that you would probably meet the criteria for the diagnosis.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I don't know what the definition is exactly.\n",
      "I just feel like I'm different from other people in that respect, though.\n",
      "If other people keep things [inaudible 00:35:59] than I do, they must be doing a very good job of hiding it because I don't know how to describe it, but I feel... I mean, as I said, my husband and his family, they don't do things [inaudible 00:36:13].\n",
      "They don't keep things like that.\n",
      "They clear things out regularly and routinely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "So yeah, I don't know if I would probably be diagnosed with something or not, but I feel like I'm a bit different from normal people in the regard of the amount of stuff I keep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder or clutter problems without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 33:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Some people have thoughts on that, and some people say that probably the only way to do that is in their homes.\n",
      "That's why we ask that.\n",
      "Have you ever tried to get information about hoarding disorder or clutter problems in general?\n",
      "Interviewee: I see.\n",
      "Yeah, that I think is relatively rare in hoarding.\n",
      "We see conditions of squalor, for example, are not so very common unless you’re working in particular contexts where you’ve got a lot of poverty and mental illness concurrent with what might look like hoarding and is a good bit of squalor which is indifference in the living, you know, people just don’t seem to care what condition they live in and I’m going to say that that’s not so common in hoarding and is probably accompanied by other comorbidity that better explains that indifference.\n",
      "Which would be, I’m guessing it’s going to be a serious mental illness.\n",
      "The others, defensiveness, really that’s about the history of what family members and/or authorities have said and done with them.\n",
      "I think that’s historical experience rather than anything to do with the hoarding per say.\n",
      "Um, it does occur.\n",
      "We certainly see it.\n",
      "Those tend to be the non-voluntary cases and the people working in community public health and fire and so forth are going to run into more of that.\n",
      "But those of us who are providing clinical treatment are going to see less of that.\n",
      "So part of the challenge is that these cases come from all over the place, and whoever’s talking to them, you know, how do they come to attention and so that’s going to have something to do with these different levels that you’re talking about.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is that kind of the major, real causes of insight of hoarding disorder might be that lack of ability to perceive the illness and perhaps overvalued ideation being the main one than the others, indifference and defensiveness being either other comorbidities or reactions.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "When you speak to the issue of overvalued ideation, you probably have to do a little bit more picking apart of the concept.\n",
      "Because if we’re just talking about overvaluing objects, that’s a little bit clearer than, you know, somehow specifying what that ideation is we’re talking about.\n",
      "I get it much more easily when they talk about it for OCD than I get it for hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhmm.\n",
      "And if you were to think in your clinical experience working with people with this disorder, can you give me maybe an example of how you would try to help a patient with low insight to gain insight?\n",
      "So what kinds of thing s would you say to your patient to help them gain insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would go straight to motivational interviewing techniques in which you do a variety of strategies, but what you always do is take a backseat.\n",
      "You never ever want to try to convince them to do anything.\n",
      "You ask them questions to help them articulate why they’re making the choices they made and on a, you know, moment by moment basis and often use things like devil’s advocate to say well you know these things are obviously important to you.\n",
      "Why wouldn’t you want to hang on to them?\n",
      "I don’t know why you would ever consent to treatment because these are important to you.\n",
      "And let them take it from there, so you would always, the way I describe it is, you would always sit on the same side of the table right with them, right next to them, looking at the stuff in the that way they look at it and just keep asking questions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. Ok. Uh so the last kind of full questions that we want to ask are a little bit of a follow up from the Free Listing Prompts that we gave you initially.\n",
      "So, we talked about some of the explanations that people might have for hoarding things, so sentimental reasons or thinking that it needs to go to the right person or having some responsibility for the items.\n",
      "Do you feel that these explanations are just post hoc reasons to justify a pathological need?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hmm, uhm that they’ve come up with or that researchers have come up with?\n",
      "Interviewer: Uh.\n",
      "Interviewee: For both, I guess?\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess both, because I would say that the researchers have come up with these from talking to-\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewer: -patients.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Uhm, I don’t think its just a post hoc assessment or way to explain away just a general need.\n",
      "I feel like more people would just explain that they also just feel a need and they don’t know how to explain it; because that will come up in other disorders, where sometimes-- Say people with social anxiety, you know, sometimes they can’t really articulate what they’re worried about, but they feel a lot of fear and they can articulate that, but not what the consequence might be or, you know, the reason they they’re afraid, and same with OCD-- For some people they’re able to articulate the reason but not everyone has a specific reason, they just feel uncomfortable.\n",
      "So, I feel like hoarders would probably also tell you if there was just some unexplainable need that they had to keep things.\n",
      "I think that they probably legitimately do have those concerns that have been talked about in the literature.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Because I, at least in my reading, I haven’t come across individuals with hoarding disorder calling it that- calling it a pathological need.\n",
      "Would you say that you’ve experienced or come into contact with individuals who have described it that way?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, and that’s why I’m saying I think that would’ve already come up- like patients would have already talked about that on their own.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Ok, so kind of to follow up on that, do you feel that cultural forces associating value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions during this day-and-age, I guess, play any role in the development of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, hm.\n",
      "Can you repeat that?\n",
      "Interview 007\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Can you hear me?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Hello?\n",
      "yes\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yes.\n",
      "Ok cool.\n",
      "So, I just merged the calls.\n",
      "Uhm I’m just trying to pull up the consent forms just because I don’t have that.\n",
      "So, give me a second.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok I’m just heading back to the conference hotel for lunch so I’m just going to use my phone for the first five minutes and then when I get there I should be able to [inaudible 00:1:09].\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: I’m here I’m listening and if I…if you need something from me ill speak up, but I just don’t want to get those [inaudible 00:1:15].\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok sounds good.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And the wind and stuff ok?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Alright cool\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Cool.\n",
      "Talk to you… I’ll let you know… I’ll let you know when I’m unmuted.\n",
      "Ok bye.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "I’m going to get her on the phone here in a minute.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, I’ll be here.\n",
      "I’m listening.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Alright cool.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Alright sorry about that.\n",
      "I’ve added my colleague to the other line, Interviewer 1 Henderson.\n",
      "She’s not going to be speaking for a few minutes because she realized that she’s in a really noisy area.\n",
      "And so, she’s trying to get to a place where she can, uh, minimize some of that background noise… [inaudible 00:4:04].\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure thing.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Uhm in the meantime, if you’d like to get started, the first thing I’d like to do is go through a…an informed consent that we have with you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Would that be alright?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "So, you’re volunteering to participate in a research projected conducted by NAME [00:04:24] from the UNIVERSITY [00:04:25].\n",
      "The aim of the study is to better understand the ways that researchers and clinicians think about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "You’ll be one of approximately thirty people being interviewed for this research.\n",
      "Your participation is volunteer, you will not be paid for your participation\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: There is no direct benefit to you, and you may withdraw or discontinue at any time.\n",
      "If you decline to participate in this study, no one will be told.\n",
      "Uh… if you feel uncomfortable in any way during the interview session, you have the right to decline to answer any question or end the interview.\n",
      "The interview will last approximately 60 minutes, and we will take some notes during the interview as well.\n",
      "And all your record of the interview will be…uh and subsequent dialogue, will be made.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: If you don’t want to be recorded, you will not be able to participate in this study.\n",
      "The recording will be transcribed, and all information that could identify you will be removed from that transcription.\n",
      "Then, audio recording will be destroyed.\n",
      "Uh… researchers, myself and Interviewer 1 will not identify you by name in any reports using information from this interview, and your confidentiality will remain secure.\n",
      "Subsequent use of records and data will be subject to standard data use policies which protect anonymity of individuals and institutions.\n",
      "This precaution will prevent your individual comments from having any negative repercussions.\n",
      "Do you have any questions about any of that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh nope!\n",
      "Interviewer: Mmhmm.\n",
      "And you’ve talked a lot about the fact that there is a lot of variability in these explanations.\n",
      "Do you feel like there are consistent subgroups within patients of hoarding disorder that might be useful or do you think that it’s true kind of, you know, not random, but true variability in the sense that it would be difficult to kind of group people?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think we are interested in trying to do that.\n",
      "So, my sense is that the people who say things because they, in their minds eye they have a use for it or idea for how they would use it.\n",
      "Usefulness and utility are a driving force for them.\n",
      "I would say that I see that behavior more often in men who are collecting broken furniture by the side of the road, stuff of that ilk.\n",
      "Something that they can take and do something with, and then they don’t because they collect too much of it.\n",
      "That feels different to me than what I would say is perhaps a traditional gender role in which a number of the women don’t want to part with objects because they remind them of something that’s important to them.\n",
      "Those two feel different to me in terms of the rationale.\n",
      "Again, these could be post hoc.\n",
      "It feels like we might have two relatively distinct groups.\n",
      "One of which is driven by emotion, and the other is driven by a cognitive process.\n",
      "Um, I had another example of that in the back of my mind.\n",
      "What was it?\n",
      "Um, oh yes.\n",
      "People who anthropomorphite objects and they feel for these objects, so they feel upset on behalf of the objects that might be wasted or mistreated or whatever.\n",
      "Kind of like they would be pets.\n",
      "Um, that too feels a bit different to me, and there are a lot of people who don’t have that feature at all, so that’s probably a minority.\n",
      "In fact, I’m pretty confident it’s a minority.\n",
      "But they’re somewhat a unique minority.\n",
      "So, and how do we deal with that?\n",
      "And is that harder to change than what you attach your sort of sadness and loss to because guilt goes with that one pretty heavily, and I don’t know if that’s different.\n",
      "So I think that we’re interested in subgroups.\n",
      "We haven’t really gotten this close at this stage of the research to investigate in that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So I just want to be respectful of your time.\n",
      "We are at noon.\n",
      "We have some more questions for you, but feel free to cut of the interview if at any point you’re…\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s ok.\n",
      "Why don’t I stick with you for another ten and let’s see how we do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so it sounds like you have really no issue parting with your objects as long as you know that it will serve a greater use to someone else and that they'll get as much value out of the object as you will.\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, pretty much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay.\n",
      "And so, my next question is, do you think that your problems with clutter get in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "In what way?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Oh, I have to tell you more.\n",
      "Okay, yes.\n",
      "Yeah, anytime I do want to have a meal I have to fix it up... I have trays is what I do.\n",
      "I put my plate on a tray and I'll sit down usually either in the living room or I'll come outside now that it's nice weather in the summertime, outside on my deck, and sit on a chair on the deck and eat my meal that way because my table, my dining room table, is not usable for dining.\n",
      "What else?\n",
      "There are so many things that I don't know the location of.\n",
      "Partly that's due...\n",
      "Muchly, that's due to the fact that I just moved and when I packed up to move I consciously chose not to mark every box what's in it and where it needs to go and all that.\n",
      "So, that was a mistake but oh well.\n",
      "So, there's just so much that I don't know where to find and so that impacts me daily.\n",
      "What else?\n",
      "I tend to be kind of a hermit.\n",
      "Well, not hermit but I'm an introvert and I do tend to isolate a bit but I do have quite a few friends and enjoy getting together with them.\n",
      "But mostly, I enjoy getting together with them somewhere else besides my place because I'm somewhat embarrassed about the way my house looks.\n",
      "And so, I have folks who haven't even seen where I moved even though I've been here for over two months now.\n",
      "I mean local friends who haven't seen because I keep saying, \"Well, give me another couple of weeks.\n",
      "I've got more things to put away and figure out where I'm going to...\"\n",
      "Dada dada, whatever.\n",
      "And so yeah, it impacts my social life as well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you've mentioned when you're eating your daily meals, the clutter gets in the way of that.\n",
      "Finding things in a timely manner, knowing where everything is, is affected by that as well.\n",
      "And your socialization is also impacted because you may feel embarrassed about your living space and the clutter.\n",
      "Does that sound about right?\n",
      "Participant 32:\n",
      "Yeah, that's exactly right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Well, [NAME 29:53], do you want to ask our final question and we can talk about the rest of the story?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, so this is the last thing that we kind of like to close with in all our interviews what do you think are the biggest things that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Wow.\n",
      "There’s a lot.\n",
      "There’s a lot we don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: And so, I don’t know what would be the biggest thing.\n",
      "I think… I think how to change… something I’m still going with now is how to change certain kinds of beliefs.\n",
      "I think beliefs about possessions related to sentimental attachment and so forth, those we can change.\n",
      "The acquisition we can do pretty well at, but the belief that seems to me to be the most intransigent, the most difficult to treat, is this fear of wasting something.\n",
      "It rises to the level of almost scrupulosity much like what the scrupulosity we see in OCD, in fact we have a paper out now where we’ve developed a measure of what we call material scrupulosity, and it sort of combines this intense perfectionism with this fear of waste and turns it into a moral problem.\n",
      "So, I’m only a moral person if I don’t waste anything.\n",
      "The trouble is that, you know, as a culture we’ve come to be very wasteful, so this belief in some ways is really a pro social belief, but it’s a pro social belief that’s taken to such an extreme that it destroys the person’s life.\n",
      "And being able to change that is really hard.\n",
      "The cases I’ve seen where that’s really powerful, there’s been almost no change in their orientation towards possession.\n",
      "And I think that’s… I guess for me… It’s a small piece of it because it’s a big pie, but that’s the one that seems to me the real, the most difficult attachment to break with possessions.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: I think that that’s really interesting, especially that you described it as pro social, because that immediately got me thinking about egosyntonic and egodystonic behaviors.\n",
      "We’re almost extending that, or you’re extending that to if its socially syntonic or socially dystonic and to what degree it is.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And if it’s socially syntonic its harder to grapple with.\n",
      "P3: NAME (56:23) uh want to go ahead?\n",
      "P1: Okay.\n",
      "P3: the next one?\n",
      "P1: Yeah, so um another questions we wanted to ask related to this was do you think that cultural forces that are present in our society today that associate value and self-worth with consumption and material positions, do you think that those forces play any role in the development of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm I personally think so, yeah I do think so, yeah the ‘cause ‘cause the society seems to give a lot of reinforcement um on the capacity of buying and what profess- what items can mean to someone status someone identity and someone’s tastes, you have good things then you are a tasteful and elegant person, and yeah a lot of it seems that uh this is such a consumer based society, and a lot of things are telling you to buy and all the holidays are all about buying, so yeah I think that society plays a big role in this, not that is causes hoarding disorder but it definitely encourage it.\n",
      "P3: Um, so we have I think like maybe one or two more questions, um I we’re going to try to keep it confined to the next five minutes but I want to be respectful of your time so if you need to cut us off as we wrap this up, please just let us know, okay?\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "P3: Okay, for the next questions are kind of focused on INAUDIBLE (57:15) kind of practically and how patients with low insight get to treatment, so if you could, please describe um what you think the typically process that occurs for patients to get to your office is like.\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm, uh you mean for patients with low insight?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:09:14] Maybe a little bit of a problem.\n",
      "It's kind of, I think what the main problem is I think it does create stress because when I look at stacks of papers, I think I really need to do something with that, but I've got all these other things I need to do so it kind of just doesn't get done.\n",
      "I do make some progress...\n",
      "With the pandemic, everything was closed down.\n",
      "I made a little bit of progress with papers, but not a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "How do your friends and family feel about your clutter problems?\n",
      "Have you ever had any sense of conflicts with them about it?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "My mother's made remarks about it, she's kind of a neat freak.\n",
      "But I think that's the reason I think there's a genetic component because my mom was a super neat freak, and I only had one sibling, I had a brother and he was that way too.\n",
      "I think my dad was more sloppy, although I wouldn't say that he accumulated a lot of stuff.\n",
      "My husband's very tolerant.\n",
      "He's not a super neat freak, fortunately so he just...\n",
      "As long as it, it hasn't become a big problem, as far as I haven't gotten to the point, I'm not at the point where like you hear about some of these people that have, like they can't throw out food wrappers and things like that.\n",
      "It's clutter, but it's not filth.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Where you live now, you live with your husband you said?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is the space like?\n",
      "What does the clutter kind of look like your in home?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Well I have alot of papers...\n",
      "But I don't think I can throw them out until I read them, and my dining table is covered with papers.\n",
      "Then I have a little, it was like an enclosed porch that's kind of a spare room, and originally that's where I put my sewing machines and ironing board, but now they're completely covered with boxes of things, kind of when I want to make room, I sort of put things in that one room, and now it's like, it's not really very usable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "So there's definitely areas of your home that you can't quite use to the full extent that you normally would because of the clutter?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I would say that's true.\n",
      "I have one room like that, and then also the dining room table, if I really need to, I would have to just put everything, they're kind of in separate piles, and I would have to just stack them all somewhere to be able to use the dining table.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Other than the dining table, is there any other parts of the home that you don't use?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "No, not really.\n",
      "It's a fairly small house.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. Ok. Uh well, that is just about all the questions that we have for you.\n",
      "The last thing that we wanted was, if you could tell us, you know, what do you think are some of the biggest things that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh let’s see, I mean I think- I mean I think some of the- I think the research-- I know, I know that the research that you often are able to do in a graduate program, or something like that, with more subclinical folks-- That was more of an issue of how do you identify people when they’re earlier on?\n",
      "When they have some of the difficulties, but they don’t yet have the full fledge clutter problem.\n",
      "Then, how can you convince them-- Because then they’re kind of not likely to have so much of that interference at that point.\n",
      "So how do you convince them that its worthy of their time to try and nip it in the bud, rather than wait until it gets much worse?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Yeah, no definitely.\n",
      "Interviewee: And I guess if there’s other ways to identify people earlier on and to be shorter interventions, things like that, with college students or younger-- I mean with the college students and younger, its largely that their parents are containing their stuff, or their size of their dorm room is containing their stuff.\n",
      "And so, I guess maybe discussing it earlier in life with parents who have kids who are pack rats, or who that they describe as pack rats, or who have always had really messy rooms and have difficulty deciding which stuffed animals to get rid of, or things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah ok.\n",
      "Well thank you so much for agreeing to talk with us.\n",
      "I think we definitely got a lot of good insight from you, and we appreciate you taking time out of your day to help us out with this project.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yup, no problem.\n",
      "Good Luck with it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, just right before you go, are there any other people that you think its important that we talk to as part of this project that you might want to give us?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, yeah, I mean well I forwarded it to-- Well I don’t really know who is all going to be available-- I don’t know how much-- Most of the people that I know of, are the ones that are probably going to have some similar thoughts or that are from the same kind of group of people; but NAME [01:01:06] or NAME [01:61:14] might have some opinions.\n",
      "The woman that I work with, NAME [01:01:21], she does a lot of stuff with children of hoarders.\n",
      "But I don’t know how available those folks are either.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Alright.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "If we needed to, do you think you would be able to- would it be alright if we emailed you for those names for email addresses-\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer: - so that we’d be able to get in touch with them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Alright.\n",
      "Thank you so much, again, and we really appreciate it.\n",
      "Enjoy the rest of your day.\n",
      "Interviewee: You’re welcome.\n",
      "Take care.\n",
      "Interviewer: Aright.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Interview 004\n",
      "(part 2)\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Good morning, [NAME 2:13]?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, [NAME 2:15]?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, [NAME 2:17] is on the line too.\n",
      "How are you?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Hi.\n",
      "Interviewee: Alright, good.\n",
      "How are you?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Doing good.\n",
      "Doing really good.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Good.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Thank you for giving us a little more of your time today.\n",
      "We really appreciate it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So, kind of just to hop back into the interview, the next section that we had wanted… or the next few things that we had wanted to discuss with you were some of the explanations that patients with hoarding disorder have for their behavior.\n",
      "So, we kind of wanted you to think through some of the questions from the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale, and we have them here for you.\n",
      "We kind of want you to think about, in your experience, how your patients, or how you think your patients would respond to some of these questions.\n",
      "And um, just to kind of reiterate, the goal is to eventually do patient interviews and hopefully have them take a look at these questions as well, and kind of be able to compare the answers that we’re getting from clinicians and what patients are actually telling us.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: So, the first one that we had was… in the Brown Assessment of Beliefs it says, “What do you think has caused you to have these behaviors?\n",
      "Do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?” So, how do you think your patients would reply or respond to that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh.\n",
      "Let’s see.\n",
      "Certainly, I think it would vary from person to person.\n",
      "I think one of the responses is that “I don’t have enough time.\n",
      "I’m too busy, so I can’t get to doing the things I need to do to get rid of this stuff.”\n",
      "Sorry, I’m out of breath, I just walked up the stairs.\n",
      "In terms of biological cause, I think some patients answer that way, but probably the majority would not consider it a mental disorder.\n",
      "So, let’s see.\n",
      "I don’t think there will be one universal explanation on the part of patients.\n",
      "So, I think they will vary along those lines.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Do you think that there are things that would make a patient more likely to believe in the biological origin versus not?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think if they had recognized that in themselves and been trying to work on in and been unable to make progress, then I think they’re more likely to say it’s a biological cause, that “there’s something wrong with my brain.”\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "So, kind of to relate that back to something that we’ve been talking about earlier.\n",
      "How does that kind of tie into the insight question that we’ve been talking about?\n",
      "So, it seems like they need to have some insight in order to be doing the things to try and improve, that that’s kind of tied into their understanding of it as being biological.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think so, yeah.\n",
      "I think otherwise people may have tried to do something about it but sort of given up and convinced themselves that this is ok, that this is just the way I live, and it’s not a big deal.\n",
      "So, I think, in part, that’s a function of some defensiveness and a part of people… I think we talked about this last time.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "P3: Um well, thank you so much for you time and for your really wonderful and thoughtful answers that was a great interview, and we really really appreciate you talking with us about this.\n",
      "Um uh just kind of like as a closer, we were wondering if you could think of so um they ways that we’re are kind of going about doing this and getting in touch with all these people is by asking at the end of our interview if there is anybody else who they think it really important that we talk to about these issues or who they think um are the key people so that we don’t miss anyone important, so is there anyone you really think we should talk to?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um I believe you have you have many people many researchers in the field already on the list like NAME (1:07:48) and NAME (1:07:52) of course, I think of them.\n",
      "I wonder if you would like to talk to people who are not psychologist, because they are like the MFTs who are working with this population and I because I don’t know uh what kind of clinicians or what kind of researchers are you are targeting so I don’t know if you want more variety or less variety?\n",
      "P3: Yeah, no were trying to kind of get a pretty board I think um picture of what the clinical consensus looks like, so across the-\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm uh I see so maybe I can write you an email and just list a few names that I know locally that maybe you can pick whether they would be a good fit.\n",
      "P3: That perfect thank you so much I’ll follow up with you via email to get those names.\n",
      "I really appreciate your time um and it was really really good interview so thank you so much for you thoughtful responses.\n",
      "Interviewee: Thank you, oh thank you, good luck.\n",
      "P3: Thank you\n",
      "P1: Alright, thank you.\n",
      "Interviewee: okay bye, nice talking to you.\n",
      "P3: Nice talking to you, take care.\n",
      "Interviewee: You too, bye.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh yeah, homeowner’s associations certainly are, health departments, elder service agencies, child and family services, animal control, they all have stories, and they all have cases.\n",
      "I think health departments have a lot of them.\n",
      "Elder services agencies have lots of them.\n",
      "I doubt there’s an elder service agency across the country that hasn’t had multiple cases, hoarding cases, that they deemed some of their most difficult to deal with.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: I kind of wanted to hop in and ask you a question or two about something that you mentioned earlier.\n",
      "So, when you were describing the Buried in Treasures and really, kind of, marketed as a workshop as opposed to treatment versus therapy, is that because of the ideas about shame that you’d mentioned earlier?\n",
      "And, [INAUDIBLE 27:02].\n",
      "Interviewee: In part.\n",
      "Yeah, in part it is, but also because when we started, the reason we started these workshops was because there were very few therapists who know how to treat it, and this workshop was designed to be run by anyone.\n",
      "And so, the first set of workshops was run by my students, and these were not graduate students, these were undergraduate students, and then we moved from there to having them run by a peer, that is someone with lived experience hoarding.\n",
      "So, that was the idea behind these workshops, to make them affordable and increase accessibility to some kind of intervention.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "Ok, and I also wanted to… I’m not even really positive how to phrase this question, but something throughout the interviews and through our conversation with you that I feel like is continually resurfacing that I think is very interesting about this disorder is how external it is in the sense that a lot of it comes down to individuals who are interacting with this person in terms of making them aware of the disorder, in terms of helping them to get into treatment.\n",
      "Do you feel like that’s something that’s unique to hoarding disorder or more salient here than in other psychiatric disorders?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I think it might be more salient for people who are close to the individual because other disorders – anxiety, depression, and so forth – a lot of the behaviors can be hidden, a lot of the experiences can be hidden, but in hoarding disorder, for anyone who is in that person’s living environment, it can’t be hidden, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why.\n",
      "And definitely because this has an impact on everyone around the person, so other people living in the home, if the person lived in an apartment other people living in the apartment building, or in the condo, or even in the community, gets affected by this.\n",
      "And so, this is more than a mental health problem, this is a societal problem, because it has implications for lots of different parts of society.\n",
      "And that’s why, you know, in this disorder we have the health department involved, we have elder service agencies involved, child and family services, the fire department, animal control, all these agencies that have responsibilities to their community have a stake in hoarding, and that’s not the case with other mental health disorders.\n",
      "So, I think that’s why it looks that way.\n",
      "035\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "... the clutter that I've just, don't keep a neat house, et cetera, et cetera.\n",
      "Lots of tchotchkes, things and that, all over the place.\n",
      "Over the years, it has evolved into more of a hoarding thing.\n",
      "I think the biggest issue is clothing.\n",
      "It's crazy.\n",
      "That is, as far as taking up space and everything, it's clothing.\n",
      "But, the other thing that really affects me is not being able to find stuff, and either having to purchase to replace or whatever.\n",
      "Then, the third piece is the clutter hoarding originally, occupied two rooms, and it's growing.\n",
      "It affects my ability to use the space I have in my home, and makes me reluctant to socialize, invite people over.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you have any problems hearing me at any point, just let me know.\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Now we're going to move into the more, just conversational part of our interview.\n",
      "I'd like to start by asking you to tell me a little bit about what this has been like for you.\n",
      "How it began, how it became a part of your life, and how it moved to how it is now?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "How did it begin?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I've basically always been messy.\n",
      "I've always hung onto things, either because of memories or just didn't, getting used to, this is what it looks like.\n",
      "It started getting out of control where yeah, I had cluttered drawers, and maybe had too many knickknacks here and around, to instead of a cluttered drawer, it evolved into a junk room, maybe an extra bedroom that started filling up.\n",
      "I thought, that's okay.\n",
      "Everybody has some messy room, where bits and pieces of their lives lived, just to be pulling out the things that you need.\n",
      "Then, it started taking over, and again, it would turn into, good Lord, where do I start?\n",
      "Where do I start dealing with this?\n",
      "Just feeling helpless, and having that inability to get up and deal with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like it's always been with you a little bit, in the sense of, you've always had problems staying organized.\n",
      "It crept up on you in terms of its presence in your space, where first, it was just one room, and then it just evolved from there, of how much space was being taken up.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 035:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That does, yeah.\n",
      "At the same time, the depression overlays a lot of it.\n",
      "I'd be aware of my mood, and that sort of thing.\n",
      "It's like, oh, I can just sit here all day and not do anything, and there sits ...\n",
      "My bar is three inches deep in mail that needs to be just thrown out, this, that and the other.\n",
      "Just not being willing to get up and deal with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you notice that when you're feeling depressed, it's harder for you to deal with your stuff?\n",
      "So it tends to pile up more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Are there parts of your home that don't have any clutter?\n",
      "That maybe you keep a bit cleaner than other aspects or other parts of your home?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "They all have a certain amount of clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "In the rooms with the clutter, is there any sorts of organization or do you just kind of stack things and...\n",
      "Is there any sorts of way that you organize them?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "The magazines are kind of stacked on one little shelf, big shelf actually, and the papers are mostly on the dining room table, and I do have, I have books and I have... I have like three bookcases, but they seem to always be overflowing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I guess I kind of, they're kind of clustered in piles that make sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So there is a level of organization then within the things that you collect?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Now I want to talk a little bit about what you would ideally like your home to look like.\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Well, I would like to be able to use the tables for tables, and not for, yeah, I think I would like it to look a little less full.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So ideally, you would like it to be a bit neater and have kind of less stuff?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you think about your possessions, what do you think makes them valuable enough to keep around, and how do you determine whether something has value or if it doesn't?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "I think it's, a couple of years ago my mother had downsized, moved from a large house to a smaller house, and she got rid of everything.\n",
      "Any kind of family things, she didn't keep.\n",
      "She doesn't have an attachment to things so she told me whatever I wanted, I better take it so I have several boxes, that I've had for a year or two, and I haven't even opened them.\n",
      "I think a lot of it is family things, especially things that remind me of visiting my great aunts, and some of them have some value in themselves.\n",
      "Like one thing I have, I have an original Charles Schultz' drawing, but a lot of it is not really of any value to anybody else, but it just sort of, because I attach memories to things, I think it's hard to let them go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So for you, sentimentality is a big aspect of it?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know you said you had some maybe monetarily valuable things, but it kind of sounds like that's less important to you than if something has sort of family attachments to it?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Mhm. Another question on the BABS that we kind of wanted you to think through how your patients might respond is, “How convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that something bad will come of discarding them?”\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that’s… if it’s worded correctly, I think patients will say that they are convinced.\n",
      "And a large number of objects collected and saved by people with hoarding disorder, they want to save because of this personal, emotional connection.\n",
      "There are a lot of people with hoarding disorder, and these things aren’t mutually exclusive, but a lot of people with hoarding disorder keep things they don’t want, and they do that because they can’t get rid of them appropriately.\n",
      "They have to find a good home for it, they have to make sure it’s not wasted, they have to make sure it’s not harmed, and those things require so much effort that they simply don’t have time to process all the stuff they have to get rid of things.\n",
      "And so, they would say they need to save these things, but not because the necessarily want them but because they have to make sure they’re not wasted in some way.\n",
      "So, I think that’s a subtle part of this that… it depends on how that question gets interpreted by the person being asked.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Well, something that we’re kind of trying to do… these questions have been kind of challenging, more challenging for us to develop because the Brown Assessment of Beliefs is much more geared towards Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and [INAUDIBLE 16:01].\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right.\n",
      "We struggled with that for a number of years trying to figure out a way of asking questions that would elicit insight, and it’s not easy.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And so, I think that’s part of the project that we’re also interested in.\n",
      "I guess, what did you come to with that?\n",
      "How do get an insight through these kinds of measures?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Well, the other complication for this, with respect to that question, is if you’re asking people about their reasons for saving things, is that a question of insight or is that the disorder itself?\n",
      "And I think that’s an important question because the disorder involves these reasons for saving and their beliefs about these reasons for saving, so if they have strong beliefs about saving something for sentimental reasons, is that a question of insight or is that a question of the severity of the disorder?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah.\n",
      "So how have you, kind of, come to deal with this problem?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, if you want to talk about insight, I think for hoarding you want to go back to its original definition.\n",
      "You want to talk about the belief about whether a disorder exists, a belief about whether this is interfering with my ability to live.\n",
      "That’s probably the place to go with defining insight and hoarding, because otherwise you get all mixed up with this process, and if you define the belief about possessions and the strength of those beliefs as insight, then what’s the disorder?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm.\n",
      "And have you developed, kind of, good questions for asking people with this disorder that you feel reliably and consistently get at this?\n",
      "Because I know last time we had talked about how insight can be kind of a shifting target.\n",
      "[INAUDIBLE 18:02]\n",
      "P3: Mhm, like what is the process for patients that they are able to transitions from low insight to a place where they are able to get treatment?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm um, I remember a few people that shared with me that they were they were in the beginning very ambivalent about where they had a problem or whether they want to get treatment, and so they they started to to enter this ambivalent and because somehow they they started to realize this is not normal or not everybody or not many people can encounter situations like this and I think they actually some of them mentioned that they were watching the hoarder show, and then it was kind of making them like to think ‘ am I like that?’ or ‘how much am I not like them’ and they started to like have a context of ‘oh how that’s like’ or ‘how I can compare to this person in the TV show’, so that has pros and cons and that sometimes encouraged them to to want to um get more information’s about, it sometimes is makes them feel like um they’re very scared to come out because the hoarders show is very extreme and so they will start and then then look for more information and um an then almost like staring to open their eyes up and starting to pay attention to to things and resources and a lot of my um our folks are familiar with the local organization, um mental health association, they do um a lot of outreach to to different settings so they they start to get in touch with this organization so they start to get in touch with their peer group and a lot of people in the peer support group they are still um kind of like feel like they are just clutter-ers they are not hoarders, they are very sensitive about the the differentiation of the two different types of people.\n",
      "Yeah so I think that that’s how I imagine that they start like just sitting at home thinking there’s no problem and then they start to reach out to resources for help, yeah.\n",
      "P3: Um and how long has their behavior typically been going on by the time you see them in treatment?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm, um I would say decades.\n",
      "P3: Decades?\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm, yeah.\n",
      "P3: Uh, and\n",
      "P1: Um\n",
      "P3: Go ahead NAME (1:01:38)\n",
      "P1: No go.\n",
      "P3: No it’s okay, you take the next one.\n",
      "P1: Mkay, um so when you will first see a patient how aware are you, or how aware are the typical patients that they have hoarding disorder when they first come in?\n",
      "Interviewee: How aware are uhuh.\n",
      "P1: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: The people I would see they would they would typically they would already say they have hoarding problems; I want to see you yeah they would already self identify as someone with hoarding problems\n",
      "P3: Oh okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "P3: And what do you think the role of family and friends in kind of getting to a hoarding diagnoses are?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah they are they are, I would say I’ve met some of them they were encouraged by their family members yeah-\n",
      "P3: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewee: So they-\n",
      "P3: Which which of their family members most often are involved?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh which one, which of them?\n",
      "P3: Mhm, which family members most often kind of help them to to reach their-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I remember you saying that you had been retired for a while.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "My next question is how have you been coping since COVID-19?\n",
      "What sorts of techniques have you found helpful in coping with all these changes?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "It's kind of hard to say because I don't really feel like the changes have effected me that much.\n",
      "I kind of joke to some of my friends that it sort of brought out my inner hermit.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:58:53] I've actually been reading a little bit more, which it seemed like I never had time to do so yeah, I don't feel like it's effected me negatively, at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "My next question was actually about where you seek comfort, and if you sought comfort from your items, but it kind of sounds like most everything has remained the same for you then?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah, pretty much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you've had no changes to the people that you are living with during COVID or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "No. Not, yeah, because it's just my husband and me.\n",
      "I don't think it's effected him.\n",
      "He's kind of doing what he's always done.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about your family members that don't live with you and your friends that don't live with you, do you keep in contact with them?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "My mother is 90, and a couple years ago she moved into one of those places, but it's not assisted living.\n",
      "It's residential living.\n",
      "[crosstalk 01:00:05] They have a dining hall and recreation and she's actually coping really well.\n",
      "[inaudible 01:00:19] ... this is the way I grew up, it's like no big deal.\n",
      "But I think it is becoming, they're very, some people would say overly cautious because in theory they're not even supposed to visit their next door neighbor, but I think that's started to happen because you can do that for a couple, three months, but after that, at some point people are just, I think it's harder on her.\n",
      "I think she lives about 500 miles away, and if we had a bigger house, she might consider moving in with us, but she's not at that point yet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about your own sense of isolation?\n",
      "I know you said your mom definitely felt that it was a bit isolating during COVID, but how about you?\n",
      "Have you been effected at all in that sense?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "[inaudible 01:01:40]\n",
      "... women and I think it's a little bit harder for them.\n",
      "One of my other single friends works in financial services so they're considered essential so she's still working, and it hasn't really effected her and she still goes out and plays golf.\n",
      "I do have a couple of friends who pretty much stay inside all the time, and I think it's a lot harder on them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But for you, it's mostly been just neutral, no big changes or anything?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I just have a couple of demographic questions to ask you really quick, and then I'm going to ask for some info so that we can send you your card.\n",
      "First off, what's your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 30:\n",
      "Ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And one thing that we’ve heard from clinicians when we started doing these interviews is around the concept of insight is “well my patients already have insight when they seek treatment and so, you know, this isn’t something that I really go through with patients so much because, you know, they have to have some insight in order to get to my office.”\n",
      "And so I’m wondering if you can talk about how this process can occur for patients who are kind of on their own, when they don’t have someone helping them through it.\n",
      "How do patients come to this realization themselves sometimes or not?\n",
      "Interviewee: You mean the realization that I have a problem?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Mmhmm.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The realization that they have a disorder that might need treatment.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "I think largely it’s family and friends and criticism they receive and the depression they experience and the social isolation that comes along with the lifestyle.\n",
      "Because if you got a home that you don’t invite anybody over to, you got a car that’s full of stuff so you’re embarrassed to have anybody ride, your life becomes narrow and a little bit isolated because you can’t reciprocate dinner parties, or visits to people’s homes, or going places with people, and so forth because you don’t invite them over to your house.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "And that kind of arises just from interacting with people and recognizing the damage it does to your things that you value on your own?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Um, I want to be very respectful of your time because we’re at an hour and that’s what we asked for.\n",
      "We have more questions for you and I wonder if and NAME [57:55] you can jump in here if you don’t think that this is right.\n",
      "I don’t know what the rest of your day looks like, and you probably have an appointment or not, and we can talk about the best way to proceed, but I think it would be very helpful for us to talk to again at some point as we kind of done more and more of these clinician interviews and to have you kind of talk through what we find and to hear your thoughts on kind of our evolving understanding of this as we move through the interviews.\n",
      "So depending on what, you know, if you’re able to continue and answer the rest of the questions now or even kind of if you do have time, I think we would be really well suited for, if you’re open to it, talk to you again at some point and to kind of get your thoughts on our findings and to talk through some of these issues in greater detail later as we hear from more and more people.\n",
      "NAME [58:48], what do you think about that?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Well I think I’d first like to hear about your availability NAME [58:56] for, if we would have some more questions for you today, would you be able to…\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Unfortunately, today I don’t have more time.\n",
      "So I do have to go in a minute, but I would be happy to talk with you again sometime.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. Ok, excellent.\n",
      "Thank you so much for your answers to those prompts.\n",
      "Now kind of to move into the next section of the interview, would you mind giving us a little bit about your background related to hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "So, my post B.A. work was in- with NAME [00:16:23] and NAME [00:16:24] and NAME [00:16:25] doing some of the early research on separating O.C.D from Hoarding.\n",
      "So, I worked- so, that was kind of my initial training on how to assess hoarding and how to go out to homes.\n",
      "I worked specifically on an MRI project, primarily an [inaudible 00:16:56], and for that project I did a lot of interview assessments of hoarding to varying other mental health problems; tasks where we would have folks choose, let’s see- they would bring paper items from home and we would scan them, and while they were in the MRI they would choose whether to keep the items or not, or we would shred it while they were in the MRI if they chose to discard it.\n",
      "And then, you know, have various tasks related to categorization, related to organizing memory, different stuff like that.\n",
      "Let’s see, and then household assessments of hoarding and discarding tasks and shopping and non-shopping trips, and then-- So that was all before graduate school, and then in graduate school I did some research on perceived deficits of hoarding for my masters and some other smaller projects related to hoarding.\n",
      "And then since I’ve been in post-back and since I’ve been licensed, I have patients that I see with hoarding, and I work with another-someone in Louisiana that specializes in hoarding as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok excellent.\n",
      "So, could you talk to us about-- Well what are some of the most important features of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "You know, what are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, like collecting or something like that, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well that they don’t actually have their stuff on display.\n",
      "They don’t really use their items in the way that they’re intended.\n",
      "So, like they may have all sorts of crafting supplies, but then not actually have any place or time to set aside that they use them.\n",
      "And so, it’s usually kind of too much of the materials that they would actually use in a reasonable time-- And like not…yeah, basically that-- Or not having space for it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Are there other really standout features that define hoarding disorder, clinically?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm standout features, I mean certainly the amount of clutter is going to be-- Like some, like-- Once in a while people will think that they have a bad problem and its really not that cluttered.\n",
      "So usually how they describe [inaudible 00:20:24] hoarding; or if you have home visits and are able to see the mount of clutter; certainly, if they have damage-- Like here there’s a lot more issues with termite damage that will come up, or infestation from bugs, things like that.\n",
      "Certainly, if they have financial problems from it, we’ll indicate if it’s a problem.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "I've not collected more things other than a few rusty things I've picked up during walks and stuff, but you know, I'm not going to thrift stores.\n",
      "I haven't been buying supplies for my business, jewelry business, and I like being by myself, so sheltering in place was fine, and eventually I started seeing my friends out on walks and stuff, so how has it affected me?\n",
      "I ended up doing a lot of drawing which was not the first thing I thought I would be doing.\n",
      "I did a lot of doodling and drawing and coloring, and stuff like that.\n",
      "It was sort of meditative and kept me calm, especially when I'm watching the news.\n",
      "And from all those drawings, I decided to make greeting cards out of them.\n",
      "I made prints of them and made greeting cards, so that's been a big part of the last few months.\n",
      "It's been good mental health wise.\n",
      "I've enjoyed it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And have you, like with the extra time, has there been any extra motivation or energy to declutter, or has there been any extra energy for other projects, too?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "No. I think the energy is really low, and I've tried to be really aware of not getting depressed, and having some routine in my life.\n",
      "I do yoga and I've been pretty disciplined about that, at least an hour a day, but generally energy is quite low and I'm not very self-disciplined.\n",
      "I judge myself on that, too, although my friends would say that's not true, I'm really self-disciplined.\n",
      "I'm a harsh critic of myself not getting certain things done.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That tends to be the case.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Like decluttering.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "They go hand in hand.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It sounds like there might be more time in the day, but there isn't necessarily the energy or the motivation, because you mentioned there aren't those deadlines there, too, either, to work towards making more for your business, or being held accountable to any sort of timeline.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "Yeah, you know, I'm just remembering a year ago or so I did a three month coaching session through my job.\n",
      "We got a wellness coach, and we were supposed to make goals at the beginning of the three months, and generally it was supposed to be about physical health, but I chose to make my goals around decluttering for those three months, and I really worked on it with her.\n",
      "I saw her once a week, and I had to say each week what I was going to do, and I did a bunch of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like the ... yeah, continue.\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "I kind of forgot your question, and I'm on kind of a rampage here, but, oh yeah, why I'm not getting rid of things.\n",
      "For all those years, I thought, \"I'm saving it for those days when I have time to do whatever I want.\"\n",
      "And now I have that time, and I'm struggling with not doing what I thought I would do.\n",
      "I still think that's a head, like I'm evolving into that, but am I totally wrong about that?\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "In the midst of this, I need to analyze either I clear this stuff out because I'm really not going to be doing all of those things I thought I would, or I get to it and do those things, and in the midst there's distress because I'm not doing either.\n",
      "You see what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so is there any ... ?\n",
      "Because you did mention that there was some effort towards getting rid of items that you haven't been using and that you don't have a use for, and putting them in the box, and potentially giving them away if one spent enough time.\n",
      "What inspired starting to do that, like starting to make moves towards getting rid of some items?\n",
      "Participant 28:\n",
      "That was because my studio was getting out of my control.\n",
      "It's a limited space and I love that space, so I want to continue loving it, and I wasn't loving it so much anymore, so you know, I started in a corner and just put some things away, and made that goal for myself.\n",
      "Then I got distracted and stopped doing that, but this has been a good conversation, Interviewer, because I might be able to get back to that and some other things that this has made me think about, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, it seems that you're a very creative person, and I love hearing you talk about your items, and it gives me a different view on why you would want to keep these items and why you might want to collect them in the first place.\n",
      "You mentioned that having more time since you've taken a step back from jobs and not had to be a mother, like as a mom directly caring for small children.\n",
      "How has quarantine specifically affected, and shelter in place, how has that affected your collecting and discarding?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Thank you so much.\n",
      "You have actually added to our list now just off the top of your head, so I really appreciate your effort in doing that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh, there’s a couple more who occurred to me.\n",
      "NAME [1:05:47] that’s with, he’s also out of San Diego.\n",
      "And actually would you take a look when you’re in touch with NAME [1:05:57], he can give you the list of the names of the people who are involved in the hoarding special interest group at the International OCD Foundation, IOCDF, and that group tends to have several people in it that are more clinically based.\n",
      "NAME [1:06:15] is one of them.\n",
      "Uh, these are mental health clinicians.\n",
      "Um, NAME [1:06:23].\n",
      "Uh, I know there are others.\n",
      "Well those are just popping into my head.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Thank you.\n",
      "Thank you so much for your time today.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "Much welcome.\n",
      "Bye-bye now.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Take care.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "We don't usually focus that much specifically on the OCD type stuff now but my doctors told me that since ...\n",
      "I've been diagnosed with a brainstem tumor and since that time he told me that there might be some correlation between brainstem tumors and OCD.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "It seemed like at first after my surgery, it was better for a bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Why do you feel that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Because it's embarrassing and it also can be hazardous.\n",
      "Actually, last October, before I started with the organizer, the ambulance had to come give me ... I had pneumonia and the first responders I guess told the people who ...\n",
      "I'm in a senior housing complex.\n",
      "The first responders told the two staff people who were there when they came that my place was a safety hazard.\n",
      "I ended up moving to a larger unit with another room and stuff and it's not as bad anymore.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I can imagine that was a difficult situation.\n",
      "How do your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I don't really have any family anymore.\n",
      "Friends, I had one friend who basically was ...\n",
      "She knew that it was a problem and she didn't understand it so she basically ...\n",
      "She'd say, \"I'm going to call this organization to come help you\" or something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned that when the ambulance came, they kind of expressed this sort of how your space was maybe considered hazardous and it was maybe difficult to get around.\n",
      "Have you ever had conflicts with anybody close to you like your friends or people who may run the senior complex?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Not really but my dad when he was alive had ... I had a condo that I owned and lived in.\n",
      "He ended up paying for me to get my kitchen remodeled.\n",
      "At that time, I had gotten things cleaned up.\n",
      "Then he was disappointed when he heard that things were getting messy again.\n",
      "It was a case where my brother was a responder to my Lifeline and he had come up and when the ambulance came, they had told him that it was a safety hazard.\n",
      "Apparently, he had told it to my dad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "He was maybe a little bit disappointed with you.\n",
      "Was he worried when they told him that the space may be a hazard?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I think he was more disappointed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know you mentioned that you're living in a senior complex and that now you're in a bigger unit so you have an extra bedroom so there's a little bit more space but do you live alone?\n",
      "Can you describe what this space is like?\n",
      "Interviewer: And, so how long has it…how has the illness progressed over time, how has it come to…?\n",
      "Interviewee: Over time, it seems to get worse.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And then as they age, do you feel like the illness worsens or do you feel like, um, for instance social factors like the isolation of children leaving home or spouses dying or…\n",
      "Interviewee: Well those things have an influence because if the kid’s living at home, the mother might force them to clean up their room so when he leaves to live on his own, he can do what he wants because mom isn’t there to force him to clean up.\n",
      "If someone’s in a relationship, often the spouse will say, will force the hoarder to clean up or at least allow…you know, if the hoarder’s a woman, maybe the man will clean up because he can’t stand the hoarding, so a divorce, a death allows the hoarder to essentially live any way they like and often that’s an opportunity for the hoarding to get out of control.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "A lot of the experts that we’ve talked to have said that hoarding tends to be more of a problem on elderly people.\n",
      "We’re kind of trying to get at whether that is because it is a progressive illness that worsens as people age or whether that’s a result of, you know, possessions accumulating over time, perhaps changes in levels of their social support as they get older…\n",
      "Interviewee: I think, I think all of the things contribute because a) they might not have a spouse to keep the hoarding in check, b) they’re older, so they’ve accumulated stuff over a lifetime so they probably have more stuff or they have a large house and the kids are out of the home so there’s more space to accumulate stuff.\n",
      "And, you know, lastly, they may not be working, so when they’re working, maybe they don’t have the time or energy to put into the hoarding, but if they’re out of the workplace, they can spend as much time with hoarding as they want.\n",
      "So there’s all these factors that seem to contribute.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And I appreciate that you talked through that for me.\n",
      "The final question is kind of about research related to hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And when you look at the current state of research on hoarding disorder, what for you are the biggest unanswered questions about this disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Could you repeat that?\n",
      "I lost just a little bit of what you said.\n",
      "Interviewer: Oh no. I said, as you kind of look over the current state of research regarding hoarding disorder, what are, for you, the biggest unanswered questions or the biggest things that we still don’t know about this disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, there are a number of things we don’t know.\n",
      "We don’t know exactly what causes it.\n",
      "Most experts think it’s a combination of environment and genetic elements, but there, you know, there may be other factors at play.\n",
      "The other thing is: we really don’t know how to treat it.\n",
      "There are models to treat this with CBT, medication doesn’t work particularly well, so we need to figure out treatments that are more effective.\n",
      "Interviewer: And for you…\n",
      "Interviewee: So there’s this unaddressed need to develop effective treatments.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "What would be your process of choosing between things?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Hopefully the biggest items first.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you think you would start from big to small, so some bigger furniture pieces and go from there?\n",
      "Or bigger boxes?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Bigger boxes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Bigger boxes, yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what's trash for you and how do you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "That's difficult.\n",
      "When the dogs chewed it to oblivion.\n",
      "I have a hard time throwing things away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, when it's unusable to the point where it's chewed up by the dog.\n",
      "What else would be trash?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I might figure out that I have way too many plastic bags.\n",
      "I might throw one away and then next week I'm going to need one just that size and it's not there.\n",
      "So, I won't do that again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so you hold on to those things that might be trash but you feel you might also need it in the future.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yeah, and if I was organized, which is never going to happen, and knew where everything was, I might know when I had too much of something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, thinking about what do you think are the most important differences between saving or collecting and hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Well, the mess is the hoarding.\n",
      "Saving and collecting, it should be organized where you know what you've got and you know where to find it.\n",
      "And you know who could use it better than you and that sort of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so when it becomes just a mess and things are piling up, that would be hoarding.\n",
      "But if it's organized and kept in the place it needs to be, that could be considered saving or collecting.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what does hoarding disorder look like and how is that same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Let's see, I like to blame it on not having the energy to take care of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you say hoarding disorder looks like?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Messy, dangerous, wasteful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And would you say that's the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "That's not nice.\n",
      "It's certainly there, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "I know you mentioned messy house.\n",
      "But is there a way to tell someone if they have hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I would think so, but I could be wrong.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's okay.\n",
      "And where you do you get information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where have you heard of it before?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "On television of course, my husband turned it on all the time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, yeah-\n",
      "Interviewer: As I mentioned the last time we talked, but I’m not sure you could hear me then, this is obviously all confidential.\n",
      "So what will happen at the close of this interview is we will have… we’re gonna make a recording once the interview begins and that will be transcribed.\n",
      "Anything that could identify you in any way will be removed from the subsequent transcription and then the original recording will be destroyed.\n",
      "So there shouldn’t be anything to identify you and obviously nothing identifying you will be published or released from our university.\n",
      "Is that all okay with you?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that’s fine.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, ok so they might come in because they’re personally distressed by their behavior because they’re encouraged by their friends or relatives or because there’s a local agency that’s intervened in their lives somehow and are forcing them to deal with their…\n",
      "Interviewee: Well the agency can’t force them to do anything, but the agency can force them to clean up or may go in and clean up their yard and send them a bill, and then the patient might be personally distressed and because of that experience it may contribute to them coming in.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Those are the lists that we have for you today and to kind of move into the interview, I’d just like to start by asking you to describe for me a little bit of your background relating to hoarding disorder, your training, and your current either research or practice.\n",
      "Interviewee: So I’m a psychiatrist.\n",
      "I’ve been treating OCD, hoarding, and related disorders since the late 1980s.\n",
      "I’ve conducted research over the years.\n",
      "I’ve published widely on OCD and some on hoarding, I give lectures on OCD and hoarding disorder, and I personally treated dozens, uh probably dozens of hoarders and probably a couple thousand OCD patients.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Are you currently seeing patients with hoarding disorder clinically?\n",
      "Interviewee: A few.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So to kind of start the conversation about your views on hoarding, if you were to explain to someone who knew nothing about hoarding, what you think the most important differences are between normal saving behavior, such as collecting perhaps, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "How would you distinguish hoarding disorder from normal saving behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: That the person is unable to discard unimportant items or items that otherwise lack value and because of the that, the living spaces become unusable.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: Or they become cluttered and in the worse cases, they’re not usable.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Is it possible to hoard items that have, um that have value?\n",
      "I mean can one be a hoarder if one kept valuable items instead of worthless items?\n",
      "Interviewee: So you’re asking if someone can hoard things that do have value?\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And can you think of a case or…\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t recall having a patient like that.\n",
      "I have had patients who save valueless items as well as items that arguably have some value.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mm-hmm.\n",
      "So it seems like for you the question of valuation, perhaps it’s a matter of not distinguishing between valuable and unvaluable items when you see them.\n",
      "Is that, would that be correct?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Well, because I was a collector with coins, I know how valuable a coin is or a bill is based on how old it is, what condition it's in.\n",
      "So I have books that tell me how much they're really worth.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So monetary value then.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, monetary value.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I have clothes that are like retro clothes.\n",
      "I did do the whole one of those clean books say take all your clothes and throw them in the middle and then sort them out.\n",
      "I did do that, but I did keep some clothes that were retro, and I was actually an extra in a movie and they said, \"Where did you get those retro clothes?\" I'm like, \"In my closet.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow, that's so cool.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "So was makes it valuable is the sentimental value, that monetary value.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Just kind of the emotional value.\n",
      "I still have a couple dolls.\n",
      "I remember my godmother that gave it to me.\n",
      "She hardly had any money herself and she gave it to me, a doll my mom wouldn't let me touch because she only had one doll in her life, and her brothers tore it apart.\n",
      "Here this was the doll that she ...\n",
      "She kept telling me, \"When you get a place of your own, I'll send it to you,\" but she never did because she actually wanted it herself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It was sentimental to her.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Then photographs too.\n",
      "I have a hard time with photographs.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Photographs, okay.\n",
      "So now what do you consider to be trash?\n",
      "What are the kind of times that you discard, other than the papers that you've said?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Oh. Well, things that are ... if they've got stuff on them, like food on them, or if they have any type of mail.\n",
      "As soon as the mail comes in, I automatically get rid of anything that isn't a bill and just advertisement.\n",
      "That's trash.\n",
      "I'm realizing now I need to ... we already talked about anything that's really old.\n",
      "Just trash, trash.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so just normal trash that you don't want.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So what do you consider the most precious item in your house, if you can choose one?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I'd say photographs.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So why do you consider photographs to be the most valuable thing you own?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Well, before we got smartphones, that was our way of kind of taking a moment and keeping it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I have pictures of my parents and my sister that I cannot retake.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "They're moments frozen in history and they're precious because you remember back to that time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "So I guess those are-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's like the memories that you were talking about.\n",
      "The memory of it you don't want to part with.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Not an organizer, I did Google ads, but it didn't appear that it was covered by insurance, but I am in the care of a counselor and I am on medication and I have done group study things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "So you've done the hoarding group?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how did you find the person who you're seeing now?\n",
      "How did you originally locate them and choose them?\n",
      "And also how is the experience for you?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I think I saw something like a flyer or something on the internet when I was trying to Google for help and it talks about going to get help and I put it in when I realized that this isn't something that I'm going to be able to ...\n",
      "It's also when you feel like you're not the same person and that this is the one area in your life that for some odd reason you're missing the genes.\n",
      "I did find something on the internet that led me to the place where I'm getting treatment and everything.\n",
      "It took a long time for them to call me back and to the point where it was really bad and I was almost crying because they hadn't called me back.\n",
      "But it's been really good.\n",
      "I finally found the right person for me because there's no judgment and which gives me sometimes practical issues for my problem.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "And I don't mean it's not the 10 steps that you can find on the internet about cleaning your house, but just realizing that those 10 steps don't work for you because you don't process like other people.\n",
      "And just being able to bounce things off to prioritize as well too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like it was really important for the counselor that you're seeing to kind of validate that it's not your fault that you can't just clean up your apartment.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I think that's right.\n",
      "Interviewer: What would you want to tell someone who was about to start cognitive behavior therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: I would say not to fear it, not to be stressed out about it.\n",
      "Having seen what I have seen here, and when I say that I mean just seeing some of the people that have come in, some of them, which go to my daughter’s school, you have no idea that “Wow, she’s here too” or “He’s here, I had no idea.”\n",
      "It’s something that a lot of people, I guess the ones who have been willing to talk about it or have had someone who has perceived intentionally that you could get help like this, that it’s available; you shouldn’t be stigmatized about it, you shouldn’t worry about it.\n",
      "It’s not a big deal.\n",
      "You know, if people only realized you probably would find about a third of the country is in some kind of therapy or is taking some kind of a drug, unfortunately, to assist them with depression or something like that.\n",
      "I have been surprised on a number of occasions with former friends [9:05]\n",
      "and to find that half of them were on antidepressants in their 30s or 40s you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Think of three things that describe you felt about CBT when you first heard about it.\n",
      "What would those words be?\n",
      "Speaker: Words about how I felt about CBT…\n",
      "Interviewer: So think about three words that described how you felt, when you first heard about it, and what would those words be?\n",
      "Speaker: Helpful… non-threatening…common.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, helpful, non-threatening, and common.\n",
      "If you were to add a picture to each of those words, what would it be?\n",
      "Speaker: Add a picture to each of these words… helping a kid with like, homework.\n",
      "That’s what we’re talking about.\n",
      "Non- threatening, talking to a police officer.\n",
      "Interviewer: who’s talking to a police officer?\n",
      "Speaker: Anybody.\n",
      "Interviewer.\n",
      "Anybody.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Kids today are afraid of police officers in many cases… what was my last suggestion?\n",
      "Interviewer: Your last one was common.\n",
      "Speaker: Common, just looking at a crowd of people and probably a third or half of the people either could use therapy or are in therapy in some way, shape, or form.\n",
      "Interviewer: So the goal of CBT is to reduce anxiety.\n",
      "If someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life, what would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: Not noticing either the symptoms, case in point, or not being informed, which I guess is\n",
      "of this session, trying to find a way to inform people of what people have, and that there are solutions to deal with, and they are readily available if you have insurance or maybe even if you don’t.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "What is important for other patients to know based off what you said earlier about…\n",
      "Speaker: That the three descriptive things is essentially that this is accessible and it is there to help you, and it will help you if you’re dealing with anxiety.\n",
      "It can be healed.\n",
      "You can be healed.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you tell me if there are any specific skills or areas that CBT targets?\n",
      "Speaker: Any specific skills…\n",
      "Interviewer: Or areas… what about thoughts, feelings, and actions.\n",
      "Do you feel that CBT targets those areas?\n",
      "Speaker: Well absolutely, I mean those are all anxiety base type [13:05]\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes it does affect all of those in the person’s life, and so yeah you need to find a solution [13:20]\n",
      "therapy certainly addresses that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Are there any questions you wish you had asked before you started the CBT in the context of the previous question.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah. Yes. And then also I think it has something the more I read about it as stuff like that.\n",
      "And I think it's true.\n",
      "Because when I do want to clean, I want to clean.\n",
      "I want to move everything out in the baseboards, clean the thing and then start putting things back and throwing things away.\n",
      "So I think there's also a perfectionist.\n",
      "Well, for me personally, a perfectionist thing that's going on too.\n",
      "Where it's like, I'm not going to do it unless I have the time to do it right.\n",
      "I have to get a burr up my butt to get that particular thing.\n",
      "And also the time available.\n",
      "And that takes that's a blindness too, in the sense that you could do little things, but you want to tackle the whole thing because I think it becomes painful.\n",
      "And so a little bit, isn't going to it's only going to put a scab on the wound, it's not going to heal the wound.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That totally makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "And so you don't see that as something that I feel like a normal person would be able to see, but I can't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's like, you don't just want to throw out one thing, you want to make the whole apartment perfect.\n",
      "And you also can't see that that's hard to find time to do.\n",
      "So it ends up not having anything be done as opposed to just a little bit at your time.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you think that there's a way of telling that somebody has hoarding problems without going and seeing their space?\n",
      "Do you think if you met somebody who had these problems and you didn't see what their house looked like and they didn't tell you, you would notice this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I think that you would have a sort of clue about me in the sense that I can live with a lot of stuff around me at work.\n",
      "So, if they passed that about my desk.\n",
      "Sometimes to them, it just looks like a bunch of stuff.\n",
      "But to me it looks like, I had to drop this because someone came and got me for the kitchen overflowing and then I had to stop this where I was going to put that back.\n",
      "But then you asked me where there was more paper or there was somebody at the door.\n",
      "So for me, I am willing to drop what I'm doing to take care of you, where someone else that has the ability to say, \"Well, I need to finish this first.\"\n",
      "But I have a tendency to drop what I'm doing to take care of what's in front of me.\n",
      "Because I see there's a payoff in the sense that it makes me feel good to go to other people's rescue, but I can't do the same thing for myself.\n",
      "Interview 011\n",
      "Interviewer: Hi NAME [00:01] how are you?\n",
      "This is NAME [00:02] again.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Well that sounds like a better connection already.\n",
      "Interviewer: I’m really hoping so.\n",
      "I just gave it a couple of test calls to make sure that we would be clear, but uh…\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: I apologize in advance if we have problems.\n",
      "I really can’t figure out what is going on.\n",
      "Well I appreciate your time and trying again to do this interview with me.\n",
      "I will very briefly kind of re-explain what we’re doing and then we’ll just get into it so that I don’t use up any more of your time, if that’s okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So this is a project that is aimed at gathering expert knowledge on hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And we’re kind of looking at the disorder from a, I don’t want to say theoretical level, but at a high level to try to understand the ways that experts conceive of what constitutes hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So we’ll be talking about kind of the boundary between hoarding and normal behavior and what, in your mind, really are the hallmarks of this disorder.\n",
      "The aim of the study is to try to understand kind of two-fold.\n",
      "One is to understand the state of our clinical knowledge of hoarding disorder at this point.\n",
      "Then, what we’d like to do is to compare the perspective of experts to the perspective of patients.\n",
      "And the purpose of doing this is to try to understand patient insight and to try to understand if there are disjuncts in the ways that patients and experts understand what constitutes hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And if we can perhaps leverage our understanding of those maybe different perspectives to try to get people into treatment for hoarding sooner.\n",
      "So that’s the purpose of what we’re doing today.\n",
      "The way that the study is organized is we are employing a snowball sampling methodology.\n",
      "We started with a core group of experts and then they recommended the people that they think know the most about hoarding disorder in the world, and that’s how we got your name.\n",
      "And what we’re going to do today has two parts.\n",
      "One part is called free-listing, and that’s kind of, uh, an exercise in which…\n",
      "Interviewee: What did you say that was?\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s called free-listing.\n",
      "Interviewee: Free-listing?\n",
      "Interviewer: Uh-huh.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s a social science methodology where we ask participants to generate a list of items off the top of their head.\n",
      "And then we’ll statistically compare the different lists that people produce to see if we can understand differences in the ways they think about topics based on items that are in their lists and the order that they’re in.\n",
      "So we’re specifically gonna compare the lists generated by experts with the lists generated by patients.\n",
      "And then the second part of our talk today will be kind of a semi-structured interview, so it will be much more conversational and freeform.\n",
      "And I’ll kind of walk you through some questions on this topic.\n",
      "Does that all sound okay with you?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "I'm at the one end of the spectrum of slowness and she's at the opposite end for swiftness of throwing things away just so fast.\n",
      "Now she has a better knowledge of what she likes and doesn't like and I have to look at an object a really long time usually to know and get centered and slowly concentrate to figure out how I even feel about it and sometimes it takes days for a simple object.\n",
      "Well, that would never do.\n",
      "I mean 30 seconds is too long for her.\n",
      "So, yes, that was one example of a big problem because we had a huge amount of stuff to go through and then my mother had saved every little kind of ... like if you got yogurt in a little yogurt carton she saved every one.\n",
      "They were all washed and cleaned and stacked up but you can't imagine what was in those cabinets.\n",
      "I think it was everything that came in got washed and saved.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "After her Alzheimer's kicked in and probably not everything but enough so that it was a challenge.\n",
      "And then that made it quadruply hard for me because my sister soon just abandoned the whole project, understandably but she abandoned the whole project and so then the very person that was least equipped and able to go through ...\n",
      "Same thing, they had 60 years or 70 years of things, back to the 30s.\n",
      "I have clothes here from the 30s.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "That my parents had in trunks and things.\n",
      "So now the whole ... it's like the universe is saying you've got to learn how to do this and I'm going to keep piling this on to it until you get it right and move along on this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "So it's that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so then, you've had pretty heated conflicts then with family members about this?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I have the one sister.\n",
      "She just runs from it and doesn't want to come here, nor do I want her to come here because I feel such shame and she's a highly critical person.\n",
      "Well, I think it's fair to say, she's a pretty critical person to begin with, the kind of person who can't tolerate a painting that's not even lined up exactly right on the wall.\n",
      "It just drives her insane.\n",
      "She has to go fix it immediately.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Are you still living in that same house and do you live alone there right now?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yes and yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how would you describe the space?\n",
      "What does it look like inside?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Very bad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So would you-\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Seriously, I don't know if you've seen bad clutter situations I suppose.\n",
      "It's as bad as you can imagine I would say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so there are parts through homes that you don't-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I can see that.\n",
      "So you mentioned collecting those airline tickets, and the baggage tickets, and all those things.\n",
      "So where do you draw the line between collecting and hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Well, if there's literally no objective value, and if there's an extravagant surplus.\n",
      "For example, I don't need any more notebooks.\n",
      "I have enough notebooks.\n",
      "I could part with some of the notebooks that I have.\n",
      "But that's like a pretty hard thing for me to do.\n",
      "Also, a number of things that I have here are things that I intend to sell.\n",
      "There's several things in the bags here of things that I intended to give to Goodwill or the Salvation Army.\n",
      "They're closed down, and I don't know what to do with it.\n",
      "All the thrift stores effectively are shut down, so it's just taking up space here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So your consideration of hoarding would be an extravagance surplus of items.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Or things that I can't perceive of an immediate use.\n",
      "Things that I don't see as having a specific active on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So in our list making, you mentioned some behaviors contributing to hoarding disorder that are not related to inside the home would be individuals' interactions and their lack of social engagement.\n",
      "Are there any other ways that you can tell if someone has hoarding disorder or issues with hoarding without being in their home.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Again, other than just seeing them actively keep things that other people would discard.\n",
      "Other than that, I don't really know how I'd recognize a hoarder without seeing the direct evidence.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Are there ways?\n",
      "[inaudible 00:51:13].\n",
      "Eliminate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, this is, we are trying to get all of your perspectives on that.\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Okay, all right.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:51:23].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "So, no, that's great.\n",
      "What you said is great.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Oh, come to think of it, the homeless people who have parts of things.\n",
      "I recognize that as hoarding.\n",
      "And I understand where they're coming from, so seeing things that other people have thrown away, that they're keeping to have something, just to have stuff, I recognize that.\n",
      "It's not useful to them.\n",
      "It's a burden to them.\n",
      "It makes their lives more difficult.\n",
      "That's hoarding.\n",
      "I can see that.\n",
      "But as far as the people walking around shopping in stores and stuff, I can't tell who's a hoarder and who isn't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Where did you get information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I'm online a lot.\n",
      "I read a lot.\n",
      "I read at a postgraduate professional level.\n",
      "I keep up with the National Academy of Sciences.\n",
      "And I am ancillary membership to a number of different paraprofessional, professional things online.\n",
      "And my therapist, she suggested a couple of books and gave me some handouts and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So online, your therapist, and books.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "That's a good question.\n",
      "That's a really good question.\n",
      "I hope not.\n",
      "I hope not.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "That's kind of like trying to look at me from the outside.\n",
      "Maybe because I'm kind of insecure, because there's an insecurity to it.\n",
      "I don't know for everyone, but I think that's a generalization maybe that there's an insecurity.\n",
      "There's a vulnerability.\n",
      "Maybe a little bit up and downish with the moods, but I'm not sure if that [inaudible 00:39:43] everyone or not, but I think it's a psychological problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "So if somebody looks a little bit off balance, you might think, I wonder what that entails.\n",
      "Maybe things aren't up to snuff in their house.\n",
      "I don't really ...\n",
      "When I see a person on the street, I can't really see that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You don't just think, oh that's hoarding disorder.\n",
      "It's difficult, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I was at work as a nurse, and I don't think people saw that in me.\n",
      "At work, I was very tidy and clean.\n",
      "I don't think people realize, people I don't have as close friends, that my house was a big mess.\n",
      "Although, some of the nurses I worked with said, \"My kitchen is terrible.\n",
      "I clean more at work than I do here,\" because it seemed like we spent more time at work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "So I don't think people can see that automatically, but I don't know.\n",
      "I think if a person is kind of falling apart at the seams in other ways, you might maybe wonder if they're finding their security elsewhere.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where have you heard of it before?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Well, after I kind of realized I had it, I just looked it up on the internet.\n",
      "I've taken psychology classes.\n",
      "I've gone to counseling.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I just looked it up there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so the internet definitely was one of your sources.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So is there-\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I got a book on it too.\n",
      "There were different degrees and they showed pictures and stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "My last question for you is what do you think of when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Oh, just really bad, super bad looking house and a person who's kind of messed up inside.\n",
      "They're messed up so their house is messed up.\n",
      "Their house kind of represents their brain kind of, just cluttered and just-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's interesting.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Oh, you're working from home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Of course, everyone is now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's my dog.\n",
      "I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "No, no. I'm glad you're still able to ...\n",
      "Well, you're not working ... you're working at school.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And I really appreciate, again, your time and your thoughtful responses to these questions, which are really interesting and will help us a great deal.\n",
      "So, just to give you some information on what we’re hoping to accomplish, we are now doing our interviews with clinical experts.\n",
      "We’re hoping to do about 30, although it may be more depending on how willing people like you are to share their time with us.\n",
      "And, we’re going to look at those just kind of as a set and kind of see where the group is in terms of their consensus on these issues, where there is a departure, and then we’re going to be recruiting people with problems with clutter, with just the hoarding disorder and talking to them about the same issues.\n",
      "And, hopefully the end product will be to be able to compare the understandings of the providers with those of their patients to see if we can learn a little bit more about where additions might occur and how to develop insight and to people that might still have very low insight.\n",
      "So, that’s our kind of research plan.\n",
      "And, we really appreciate you being part of it, again.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh, happy to, it sounds really cool.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, so far it has been a very cool project.\n",
      "It’s a very interesting project, yeah.\n",
      "And so, if you have any questions about it as we go forward or you think of anything or you just want to follow up and see how it’s going, we’re hoping to be able to follow up once we’re done.\n",
      "But, please feel free to reach out, and again thank you so much for your generosity with your time.\n",
      "It is really valuable for us.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, thank you.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, thank you, I’m definitely wanting to see what the results are and see where it goes from there.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Thank you.\n",
      "Well, we’ll be sure to follow up once we finish with our interviews.\n",
      "So, thank you again for your time and have a safe drive home.\n",
      "Interviewee: You’re welcome.\n",
      "Thank you very much, I’ll hear from you later.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, take care.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think one of the big pieces is what’s the purpose of that home?\n",
      "So, is it being shared with other people, what other goals that the various residents have?\n",
      "So, like I mentioned at the workshop I did today, the standards are going to be very different if there’s a 3-month-old in the house versus a 3-year-old versus a 13-year-old.\n",
      "And, kind of gauging your threshold for is the stuff interfering based on the safety of the different people living in the home and how they would want to both developmentally, but also just personal interest wise, how they would want to make use of the space.\n",
      "So, the threshold for clutter is going to be a lot lower for the 3-year-old than for the 13-year-old, as in needed to get maybe call CPS or get other involvement.\n",
      "And, then I also want to look at the specific circumstances or how are the spaces of the house being used?\n",
      "So, if there’s a bedroom upstairs that is filled with clutter, but it’s kind of been agreed upon that that is a storage room rather than a used space, as long as the family is in agreement of that, then I think it’s ok.\n",
      "I think it’s when one person’s decisions about the stuff is then infringing upon the living choices for the other family members.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Do you think home size plays any role in being able to tell or how quickly you might pick up on it?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it does.\n",
      "If you’ve got a mansion it can take a lot longer to fill it up than if you’ve got a studio apartment.\n",
      "But, I do think that if you’ve got a smaller living space it may seem more like a hoarding situation when it isn’t necessarily just because maybe multiple, there’s multiple uses for one given space.\n",
      "There was an article in the newspaper about someone living in a very small basement level apartment in I think Boston, and they didn’t have excessive stuff but because they only had like one closet the laundry basket was perpetually sitting out in the main living area, and because there was only one room, basically the laundry basket filled with dirty clothes was sitting in their living room.\n",
      "And, they felt much more overwhelmed by this than they would have if they had a two-bedroom apartment with a space where they could tuck it behind the door somewhere.\n",
      "Interviewee: When I see them or the patient sees them?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "I mean…\n",
      "Interviewee: The patient, the patient sees everything as having some value to them, whether it’s monetary, or sentimental, or other.\n",
      "But, I mean, clearly some of the things they describe to me you can, you know, you can sell on the internet, or garage sale, you can return them to the store and get some money, and so it’s, you know, it’s kind of a combination.\n",
      "Interviewer: So would you characterize hoarding disorder as being a problem with valuation, so an inability to distinguish between items that are valuable and items that are not valuable?\n",
      "I don’t know if that question makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewee: That can be part of it.\n",
      "I don’t think that’s an important element though.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "When you think about the patients that you’ve seen with hoarding disorder, can you think of a specific case or cases that were perhaps challenging to diagnose either clinically or in research because it was on the border between pathological and non-pathological behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: I can think of one case where a man collected books and his wife was quite distressed by it and the way she described it, he sounded like a hoarder.\n",
      "But he denied that he was a hoarder and said that all the books were valuable and the living spaces were usable, so I basically considered him a collector.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And that was because…\n",
      "Interviewee: But that was, that was an example of where it was hard to draw the line.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how did you draw the line?\n",
      "I mean it sounds like it was based on the…\n",
      "Interviewee: It was based on the fact that, at least by his description, you know this was a while back, I can’t remember what his wife said but the living spaces were usable and in fact everything he had could be sold, had some value.\n",
      "So he wasn’t just saving food wrappers or, you know, trash, or things like those.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it wasn’t indiscriminate?\n",
      "Interviewee: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "We’d like to talk for a minute about the DSM five criteria for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "We’re talking these through with clinicians because we would like to see how different clinicians apply them in practice.\n",
      "Are there any particular elements of the DSM five criteria that you regard as particularly difficult to apply or that you think that different clinicians may apply differently due to things like the language or clinical judgement?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, let me look up the criteria.\n",
      "Interviewer: I’m gonna…I have some phrases from the criteria…\n",
      "Interviewee: I have a DSM five right in front of me.\n",
      "Now let’s see…a persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions – now that’s fairly easy to assess.\n",
      "The difficulties due to perceived need to save the items and the distress associated – that’s fairly easy.\n",
      "See the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions – that’s pretty easy.\n",
      "Although, sometimes patients don’t accurately describe what they’re doing but relatives, if a relative’s present, they usually help.\n",
      "The hoarding causes distress or repairment – that’s usually self-evident.\n",
      "The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition – that’s usually easy to use.\n",
      "The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder – I have some problem with that and if you want me to explain, I will.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I see a therapist.\n",
      "I've been seeing her for like five years.\n",
      "The hoarding is a side issue.\n",
      "And there was a time when she wanted to focus on that.\n",
      "And she sort of suggested that she could get a social worker to come in and mirror me, double for me, keep me on focus, and clean it up that way.\n",
      "I was very resistant to that idea, because it's embarrassing.\n",
      "And I don't want to explain, \"This is important to me because, and this is why I want to keep it,\" to somebody who also looked at it and sees no value objectively.\n",
      "So I changed.\n",
      "I also take [inaudible 00:25:06] and Bupropion every day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so how did you find-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "And I read books about ADD, hoarding, and try to keep up with the latest on the issue, mental health wise.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "How did you find your therapist?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I was in a program where, a jobs program, and that's when they learned about traumatic brain injury history.\n",
      "And that was the first time, it was like 10 years ago, and that was the first time that I ever got any specific [inaudible 00:25:50] for it at all.\n",
      "Even after being in a coma for five days and [inaudible 00:26:02] when I was 17.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you're seeing your therapist, you're taking some medication, you're staying up to date on what's going on in the mental health world, yeah.\n",
      "And I know you mentioned-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "And I'm always cleaning.\n",
      "I'm always actively repairing the problem, and I don't really make much progress.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That must be difficult.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "The thing is, I'm still optimistic.\n",
      "I still think that I can do it in two weeks.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:26:26]-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Hey, optimism is great.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yeah, but I totally believe that in two weeks [inaudible 00:26:34] will be the day that I will get into focus and start realizing that I have this space, and I know what I want this space to look like, and all the stuff that's in this space that is not where I want the space to look like, has to go.\n",
      "Has to go.\n",
      "Has to go.\n",
      "But piece by piece it's a lot harder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Understand.\n",
      "So I know you mentioned before that your behavior's kind of upset your roommate, even though she kind of deals with some issues with hoarding as well.\n",
      "And then you also mentioned prior that there's this kind of scurry when you find that there's going to be an inspection to clean up some things.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Always.\n",
      "I try-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "How do your other family or friends or landlords, any of that, feel about your behavior?\n",
      "And have there ever been any conflicts?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Someone gave this one to me.\n",
      "They're not around anymore.\n",
      "There's a friend that disappeared and she gave that to me.\n",
      "So when I drink out of that cup, I think of that person.\n",
      "I know it sounds stupid, but every one of my cups, almost every one has some meaning.\n",
      "I know exactly where they came from and what was going on at that time.\n",
      "So it's really hard for me.\n",
      "Then my daughter-in-law, who is the opposite of me, she doesn't save anything.\n",
      "She came in and went through my food cupboards and got rid of two huge garbage bags full of food that she saw was expired and don't need anymore.\n",
      "The only thing of that bunch, it really hurt.\n",
      "That one really hurt.\n",
      "It was more the way she did it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "It was kind of like she was disgusted with it.\n",
      "It was pretty hard.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, of course.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "There were some things that I could use, like the food dyes and stuff like that.\n",
      "My grandson likes to play with some of that stuff, but I didn't have her come back again because it was just the feeling I got that I wasn't ...\n",
      "She doesn't have any training or anything like that.\n",
      "It was totally unintentional on her part, but I think the way that people help you really makes a difference.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:22:41] very nonjudgmental and very good, but very expensive.\n",
      "I could only do that one time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The expense is a big thing.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I think I have talked to ... [inaudible 00:22:56], I did mention that too.\n",
      "I have gotten a bunch of books on hoarding and collecting, and all those books by all those authors like how to clean and just pick the things that are joyful to you.\n",
      "So I have done that.\n",
      "My mind, I'm not dumb.\n",
      "I've been to school.\n",
      "I went through nursing school and got my bachelors degree.\n",
      "I went through social work, almost finished that degree.\n",
      "So I know what I need to do, but it's the getting started and following through that's really hard for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "It's very emotional based.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, of course.\n",
      "Yeah, it's a very emotional thing.\n",
      "So you mentioned that you did go to a counselor.\n",
      "How did you find this person?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I think through recommendations from my doctor-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I went just recently, it was for something else.\n",
      "It was for work.\n",
      "When my mom died, I kind of had a little breakdown.\n",
      "It was just really hard.\n",
      "So I was kind of dealing with that and letting the other thing kind of slide.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "It was basically something my insurance was on the insurance list, and I tried to find someone who specialized in things that looked like my problems.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And is that because the behavior of depression might cause someone to accumulate things or be unable to clean [INAUDIBLE 34:04]?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think just the behavioral activation [INAUDIBLE 34:10].\n",
      "Is it the lethargy and the low self-esteem and the feeling not deserving of living in a cleaner space and kind of an apathy about the living environment as well.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Mhm, that makes total sense, yeah.\n",
      "Ok, I can understand that.\n",
      "Ok, now we’re going to ask you some questions about the DSM 5 criteria specifically, so we’ll read you one of the criteria and then ask you some questions about how you apply them.\n",
      "So, the first criteria is consistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value.\n",
      "And, we’re kind of wondering how different clinicians might determine that term “actual value.”\n",
      "What makes the value judgement for a person with hoarding disorder inappropriate?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s more… I mean one of the challenges I feel here is when I ask somebody, and this is like a fire marshal, “How do you know if it’s a hoarding disorder situation?” He’s like, “Well it’s like porn, you know it when you see it.”\n",
      "That’s not helpful because it’s such a subjective evaluation.\n",
      "How do you attach value to something?\n",
      "I feel it’s incredibly subjective as well because, so it may not be the value attached with one individual item, but is this a pattern I see repeated across multiple items?\n",
      "As compared to the value that might be determined by my own subjective standard of the items compared to how something might sell on EBay.\n",
      "But, I think it’s more… is the individual… how much are they trying to explain or justify the value that they attach to the item?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: So, it sounds like you make the determination less about each item and more about the pattern of items.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Well, that's obviously something that I've been doing since I've been five years old.\n",
      "I call it gleaning.\n",
      "I'll keep this, but I'll get rid of this [inaudible 00:41:36].\n",
      "Things that don't fit, things that are worn, boxes that are... I really like containers and jars, particularly unusual ones.\n",
      "But there comes a time when I have too many, and I can't make up a need for them.\n",
      "There's, I have a really hard time sorting letters.\n",
      "And cleaning up, I'll come across a letter that my dad wrote me in 1992.\n",
      "And I'll sit and read it and remember those times.\n",
      "And that's not something that I want to throw away.\n",
      "I have a lot of stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so for you choosing your items comes to, \"Okay, so if I keep this, I can get rid of these five things that maybe I don't hold so much of a connection to.\"\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And thinking about your items, what do you think is the most precious item to you in your house, and what would happen if you lost it?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "My books, my first edition books, valuable books.\n",
      "And I did lose almost all of them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, you mentioned.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Ninety percent of them.\n",
      "And it was traumatic, you know?\n",
      "The whole event was traumatic.\n",
      "I mean, like PTSD big time.\n",
      "And I was in shock for a week.\n",
      "And the people around me were not nice, not helpful, not nice.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I imagine that's hard.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "But eventually I came through it, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So yeah, your books.\n",
      "And you would, it would be another traumatic thing if you were to lose them?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Truly.\n",
      "There was a time when, as a late adolescent, I was like 20 years old, 19 years old.\n",
      "Got arrested.\n",
      "Did something stupid.\n",
      "My parents decided to leave me in jail, even though they had more than the means...\n",
      "Posting my bail would not have been any problem at all.\n",
      "But they decided to leave me in jail because he had, they were exasperated with my behavior.\n",
      "And I was living in an apartment in another town.\n",
      "So my dad and my brother went to my apartment, threw away all my stuff, didn't throw away all my stuff, so that I wouldn't lose it, not being able to pay the rent on the apartment, because I was in jail.\n",
      "I was only in jail for like six weeks or so, but five weeks of that were solitary.\n",
      "And when I came out and learned of that, I was really distraught and disappointed.\n",
      "There was a lot going on that was also traumatic and harsh.\n",
      "The time when the world would definitely bent to, my [inaudible 00:44:38] to cross.\n",
      "047\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So now that we have that done, again, thank you so much for participating in the research.\n",
      "So as you know, the study is investigating individual attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question I want to ask you is what term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter.\n",
      "So if you are uncomfortable with calling it hoarding disorder, some people prefer problems with clutter or-\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, well I like the word collector.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Collector.\n",
      "So would you say problems with collecting or just collecting in general?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Well, collecting and keeping.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so collecting-\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I like the word collector rather than hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now we're into the second part of the interview where we're just going to have a normal conversation.\n",
      "First, can you please describe your collecting and how long this has been going on?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I think ...\n",
      "I'm trying to remember when I left home.\n",
      "I've always collected books, and my dad was a stamp collector and coin collector.\n",
      "So he started us off on those collections.\n",
      "I didn't continue with stamps, but I continued with coins.\n",
      "So I have coins.\n",
      "I have the president's dollars.\n",
      "I have Sacajawea.\n",
      "I've got currency, I've got coins of different types.\n",
      "They're not too organized, but I have those.\n",
      "Then my main collection is agates from the beach.\n",
      "So I have jars with agates and rocks, and some driftwood, and some sand dollars and stuff like that.\n",
      "So those are the current things that I have.\n",
      "I don't presently really collect other coins, but people will give me coins because they know I like them.\n",
      "I do collect agates.\n",
      "The book thing started as soon as I left home, and I remember my mom, when she had to move me one time, she's like, \"Get rid of these books.\n",
      "You can just get them at the library.\"\n",
      "But the books were really ... to me, it felt like it was a safety kind of comfort thing, because books felt like friends to me and I felt like, if I could take them with me from place to place, it was like I was taking a part of me that I couldn't lose with me.\n",
      "So I have tons of books.\n",
      "Papers, I write a lot.\n",
      "I've been to school, so those started accumulating and I didn't get rid of those.\n",
      "I think it was maybe after I had my son.\n",
      "I was pretty poor with him.\n",
      "I was a single parent.\n",
      "I started just organizing and saving all the bills and organizing them according to alphabetical and all that.\n",
      "I finally got rid of those.\n",
      "I just have current, very, very current bills.\n",
      "I went to paperless on a lot of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think one of challenges, because there is the assumption, the faulty assumption that people who struggle with hoarding don’t want to get better, are treatment resistant.\n",
      "There do tend to be a lot of negative pieces in there.\n",
      "I’m trying to think of how to counteract that, because I don’t think that that’s the case at all.\n",
      "And, I think that’s more of an education and outreach piece as opposed to an understanding of the diagnosis and the treatment approach.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm, mhm.\n",
      "Well, we really appreciate your time, that was our last question.\n",
      "Just kind of to close out, we were wondering if you wouldn’t mind telling us, so we’re trying to, as I said, get a really good picture of the clinical community as it exists right now and the way that they’re working through these issues.\n",
      "And so, if you were to think about the people that you would think we should talk to, thinking especially about people that we might not have heard of, we aren’t in contact with the same network.\n",
      "If you could come up with some names that we could try to find, people who you think would be valuable additions to the study, we’d greatly appreciate it.\n",
      "Let me know if anybody comes to mind.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I think, I mean the email that [NAME 86:34] sent out, it kind of covered everybody.\n",
      "Oh… yeah, I mean there is nobody in particular that comes to mind that he wouldn’t have already covered.\n",
      "Yeah, I can kind of think and go through, you know, my address book to see who else I think of.\n",
      "But, the main names of who I would think of like [NAME 87:12] and I know that they’re all kind of already on that list.\n",
      "Unfortunately, there’s not that many treatment providers.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Right, that’s why we’re kind of asking to make sure that we’re just comprehensive.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think that it’s pretty comprehensive.\n",
      "I mean, you could go through, you know just who is listed on [ORGANIZATION 87:34] website or the [ORGANIZATION 87:36] website and the [ORGANIZATION 87:37] website.\n",
      "Or, I think the hoardingcleanup.com, that listing is a consolidation of [ORGANIZATIONS 87:53].\n",
      "But, then that runs into the challenge of are these people who have self-identified in working with hoarding?\n",
      "So, you don’t necessarily know what work they are doing.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: That’s a good suggestion, I mean maybe we’ll go through that list and see who is on it and why.\n",
      "Good point.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Using it up is the way to get rid of things.\n",
      "Until it's the shoes half falling apart then even I realize ... I mean, I took a pair of shoes to a shoemaker recently and she says that, \"No, there's no way we can save these.\n",
      "We can't put new heels and stuff on them.\n",
      "It just can't be done.\n",
      "They're gone\".\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And that's when you decided to throw it away?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "No, I found a way of rebuilding the bottom with shoe glue.\n",
      "I didn't throw them away and now I'm locked in but I need one more shoe glue and I think I can build it up and use them longer.\n",
      "The tops were in very good condition.\n",
      "It's just the bottoms came apart.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So does something have to be I guess basically everything is falling apart for it to be thrown away for you then?\n",
      "In regards to shoes or clothes and stuff?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I can comfortably, to comfortably throw it away, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Comfortably.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I mean, shoes are an example where if they're not in very good shape any more I probably wouldn't spend a lot of money resoling or re-heeling them because I would see that there wouldn't be sufficient value or if I did then I would be stuck wearing them for a really, really long time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So how do you determine that value though?\n",
      "How much value something's worth?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Shoes are a little bit easier because getting them resoled and re-heeled it has become pretty expensive but if I really, really love them, also if they fit well, I have a little bit of a trouble getting shoes to fit well.\n",
      "With clothes, you repair them until ... and then I hate it if they become rags.\n",
      "I don't like that at all but ... and if somebody gave it to me then it's really sad.\n",
      "It seems really wrong to use something cut up as a rag.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "So it's back to that respecting the thing and a thing actually is mistreated it's like it has a life, it's a living thing almost.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So hmm, how do you choose between your items, about ...\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "That I want to keep?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay, so if you had to choose between items, like you had to keep these and you had to get rid of some, how would you choose?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So I think that segues perfectly into the next section which is going to be really talking about value.\n",
      "So when you think about your possessions what really makes them valuable and how do you determine if they're valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, I've probably done too much of that.\n",
      "I think it's all valuable but I'm trying to learn about that.\n",
      "I mean there are certain books I like better than other ones.\n",
      "Most people say once they've read a book they would get rid of it but I love to return to them.\n",
      "I love to return to what I've underlined and go back to it.\n",
      "So unfortunately I don't get rid of books and that's a huge problem.\n",
      "Books are big problem.\n",
      "Then my mother left, my parents, but unbelievable boxes of photographs and then other people just dumped off boxes of photographs that maybe I'm in some of them but I have been a bit of a dumping zone for people.\n",
      "I also had a business partner that dumped things on me.\n",
      "He left three storage lockers and I just took forever to get rid of that.\n",
      "I finally did.\n",
      "The whole business offices I had to clear out and it took me years to do.\n",
      "I mean, it's just ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you were saying you cleared those out, how did you decide what was trash, what to actually get rid of?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "In those storage lockers that weren't my things?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Or in my own?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, honestly both.\n",
      "I'm curious about both, [inaudible 00:33:04]-\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, it's a lot of paper usually.\n",
      "Papers are problems.\n",
      "And if it's repeated and repeated and repeated you can only keep one set right, and get rid of all the duplicates, multiple.\n",
      "There are a lot of duplicates of things in my life.\n",
      "Old saved junk mail surely can be thrown out and then my OCDs a problem.\n",
      "I'll take the glue off of these things before I recycle them so the glue doesn't get into recycling or make sure that there isn't a credit card or some kind of plastic card that needs to come out so it can go into the paper recycling.\n",
      "The agony I go through with recycling has only recently mitigated because where I live accepts very little recycling now because there's no longer much of a market for most things and if they can't sustainably recycle effectively they won't accept it so far more things go into the black bin, or the throwaway garbage, landfill, if you will [crosstalk 00:34:30]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so what I'm understanding is when you have multiples of things it's easier for you to get rid of something, right?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "If they're identical, usually, now that might not be true with clothes because I always try to use up things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, well-\n",
      "Interviewer: Well thank you for your feedback and thank you again for participating in this.\n",
      "I know it took time out of your day but we really appreciate it.\n",
      "And hopefully we can get a lot of feedback from this and develop an educational video to explain a lot of this to future patients in a way they can understand before they start therapy.\n",
      "Speaker: But I think you understand me and think you can sit there with someone who’s doing the art and your conception is so on that you can say “that’s not going to work.”\n",
      "You can say it and you have to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well thank you for your time again.\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you for meeting up with us today.\n",
      "So we’re working with a group of psychologists and psychiatrists, basically trying to get feedback about people’s experiences, patient’s experiences about the work that we do here, the therapy, more specifically cognitive behavioral therapy, and I’ll be saying CBT because it’s a lot to say cognitive behavioral therapy, so I’ll be saying that.\n",
      "We want to develop a few short educational videos that will help future patients and parents understand exactly what CBT is, especially the therapy for the children.\n",
      "So to start off, please tell me what comes to mind when you think about CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: Well in my daughter’s case, its anxiety issues.\n",
      "Being around other people, what other people think about her; she’s always thinking about that.\n",
      "Interactions with other people, going into places, like a dressing room, for instance in a store, she just feels very comfortable about doing that.\n",
      "In some cases she doesn’t feel like she belongs there; she’s not worthy.\n",
      "Another example is she was getting rewards at school, and she didn’t think she was worthy of getting them.\n",
      "She didn’t want to get up in front of people.\n",
      "So that’s kind of what I think of.\n",
      "In essence, I guess it’s another disorder, and I guess that’s how I look at it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you tell me about what you know about CBT?\n",
      "In your own words, explain what CBT is, that’s cognitive behavioral therapy.\n",
      "Speaker: Well behavioral therapy… cognitive thinking about your behavior.\n",
      "So I would assume we’re talking about how we’re addressing people who have behavioral issues thinking.\n",
      "Which for me goes back to my daughter’s anxiety.\n",
      "Is that essentially what you’re looking for?\n",
      "Interviewer: So I can’t answer the questions, it’s more so getting your complete perspective about what you know about CBT and therapy.\n",
      "Speaker: Outside of just my experience here, I haven’t done a lot of research into it.\n",
      "I mean in all honesty, I was probably the one most unaware in my family of what was going on with my daughter.\n",
      "To me, it’s like what I was seeing was so different than what I was seeing with my other daughter, and really had no idea.\n",
      "It was more of a daughter- mother communication that was going on initially, then I got included.\n",
      "So it can be, I think, very difficult to assess, and I see my daughter probably more than my wife does because I’m a stay at home dad, basically feeding and getting them off from school, and everything else, so yeah, pretty much…\n",
      "Interviewer: So as far as scientific research, given to patients or parents, do you think it’s something we should talk about in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: I honestly think that’s just going to, again, now I’m sure there are a lot more severe cases than what my daughter has, so depending on the severity of the situation, I think you may find a parent a lot more involved or concerned about what’s going on.\n",
      "In that particular situation, yeah, they may need a lot more support in terms of what is happening with their child.\n",
      "As I said before, in my particular situation, I didn’t deem my daughter’s issue to be that severe, although, you know, I don’t know how it compares to some other people, but there were some moments, according to my daughter, where she was freaking out inside, so she wasn’t able to do certain things or didn’t want to go do certain things, and I guess that could metastasize into something else later in life.\n",
      "So, level of seriousness, yeah, it’s hard to gage, but I didn’t need that, I didn’t feel that I needed to have that kind of research.\n",
      "So like I said, I didn’t go look it up.\n",
      "My wife being a physician, you, know, we basically just said, “Hey this is available to us.\n",
      "The kid’s complaining of a problem, let’s go check this out.\n",
      "Transcription paused by Aqueena @\n",
      "Interviewer: Did you know about somebody else’s experience with CBT, if so, was it positive or negative?\n",
      "Speaker: I did not... nobody that I know was I ever told went into any kind of therapies.\n",
      "I mentioned before I had friends… we moved to Florida 3 years ago, and come to find out a number of our close friends, half of them, are on antidepressants or undergoing therapy.\n",
      "I had no clue.\n",
      "It’s one of these things that ultimately gets around to some of the husbands who talk.\n",
      "So no, I really had no experience at all with CBT.\n",
      "Interviewer: So as we said, this interview is all about developing the new videos and also getting feedback on that as well.\n",
      "So first we need to decide who would be in the video, before I show you this actually, like who would be in the video, what characters do you think it should [21:07] ___?\n",
      "Speaker: Well who are you going to be showing the videos to?\n",
      "Interviewer: Patients, children, parents.\n",
      "Speaker: So it’s the first time type.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Also even adults, adults who are actually patients themselves.\n",
      "So with that in mind, who do you think, who do we need to decide will be in the videos as far as characters?\n",
      "What characters should we include?\n",
      "Speaker: Well, I mean, if they’re going to be doing this with kids, if you’re going to be showing this to adolescents, I would want obviously adolescents talking about it.\n",
      "Girls to girls, boys to boys, type of thing.\n",
      "As I mentioned to you, I’ve seen a number of kids from my daughter’s school here, and that kind of surprised me.\n",
      "There’s been a couple of incidents where I’ve found out that other kids [22:03]\n",
      "even after we started here, and I don’t know if my wife talked to them or not, the parents of the other kids, but in terms of… I was getting off track there for a second… but yeah, I’d stick to basically if you’ve got kids, then show other kids, and if the parents of the kid, then you need to possibly have a video that speaks to the parent of that child as well, or you know the parent’s obviously going to be savvy enough to sit down and understand their kid watching another kid and what’s going on.\n",
      "044\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Well, those are some great lists and that concludes our list-making section.\n",
      "So, now we're going to move into the more discussion portion of the interviews.\n",
      "My first question is please describe your issues with collecting treasures and how long has it been going on?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "It's gotten progressively worse over the last 10 years.\n",
      "My husband passed a year-and-a-half ago.\n",
      "He kept turning on Hoarders on television, the television show.\n",
      "And the dining room is totally full of stuff.\n",
      "And I haven't moved any of his stuff out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you mentioned that your husband passed and you're still holding on to some of his things and that's contributed to some of the clutter and such.\n",
      "And it's gotten worse over the last 10 years.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes, it's got worse over the last 10 years.\n",
      "I've got a lot of stuff in here that's Christmas stuff and things that I've bought online and paperwork that I need to be doing and his clothes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative) okay, so clothes and paperwork.\n",
      "How severe would you say that this problem is now?\n",
      "And do you believe your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I went to some program they had at the senior center about falling because I do fall a lot.\n",
      "And they had a grant from Stanford to come out to your house and help you.\n",
      "And I'm like, \"I'm not calling them to come out to my house.\"\n",
      "So, yeah.\n",
      "It would have been useful for me but I sabotaged myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "And how severe do you think this problem is?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Want me to take a picture for you?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, that's fine.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "It's pretty severe.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "My bedroom is really bad, it's hard.\n",
      "And I have to go to the other end of the house to go to the bathroom because the main bathroom, the part that they don't carry in California anymore that needs to be replaced.\n",
      "And it's just deferred and ridiculous.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, you mentioned this possible program.\n",
      "Other than that, have you ever sought to change this behavior or gone to a professional?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "For hoarding, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Why or why not?\n",
      "I'm not sure what a professional would do for that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "And so you mentioned your husband would turn on the TV with the show about hoarding, but how did he feel about your behavior?\n",
      "And how did other friend and family feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Well, there was a couple that we played dominoes with, go to dinner and play dominoes once a week.\n",
      "And we used to go to either their house or my house.\n",
      "We stopped going to my house because it was too messy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how did they feel about it?\n",
      "How did they feel about that?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I don't think they cared.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And, do you feel like, is it… Do you feel like this is more difficult more or less when we’re talking about items that are of low monetary value?\n",
      "Is it harder to make the distinction when you’re talking about emotional value or aesthetic value?\n",
      "And, does it matter which culture the patient is from or what their beliefs about items might be?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s harder when it’s the emotional attachment to items or the emotional value because that really is so strongly based on an individual’s experiences, or kind of how they define their identity.\n",
      "Whereas if something has more monetary value, we can even just look up what’s the resale value of “x” item?\n",
      "Or if you’re looking at maybe aesthetic, you know, we can discuss what is appealing about an item.\n",
      "Just the visual attractiveness.\n",
      "But, if you’re going to talk about the importance of a child’s stuffed animal, I have no perspective as to which animal is of greater value than another unless I truly know that person and that person’s relationship to each of those stuffies.\n",
      "And then you layer on the more intense emotional connection, and if you look at kind of the object relations and how these items are acting as extensions of those relationships to other people.\n",
      "I don’t have that background of who those people are and what they’ve gone through.\n",
      "So, I think that’s what makes it much more difficult.\n",
      "I’m thinking from different cultural backgrounds… I’m trying to think of how that has come into play, and I think it’s more asking to be educated by the individuals about where they may be coming from if I’m not aware.\n",
      "But, it can be really hard to… and I’m just trying to think of what backgrounds various clients have come from.\n",
      "And, it’s much more kind of giving them the opportunity to share what their stories are and why something would be important in that context and kind of checking my own assumptions at the door as best I can.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm.\n",
      "Yeah, that makes total sense.\n",
      "The next, kind of, criteria that we’d like you to talk through with us is the one that begins, “The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.”\n",
      "So, again, we’re kind of interested in this question of how you make the determination of how much stuff is too much, especially perhaps considering things like home size or other people in the home that might affect the degree of clutter that you see.\n",
      "Speaker: I think in most people’s case when it comes to therapy, you kind of like to have an idea how long something will take.\n",
      "That was the one thing I never thought about asking because you want to follow it through as much as you’re able to make sure your kid, or daughter, or whoever gets the treatment that they need.\n",
      "So there was never really any kind of a period that was set down.\n",
      "I mean unlike in other therapy sessions, like you go to a chiropractor and your insurance company may allow you to do 25, 30 visits.\n",
      "I have no idea what we’re able to get, you know, if there’s a limit on that.\n",
      "I would like to think I’ve got a pretty good insurance package with my wife ___ UF, but that was one thing I think some parents may like to know.\n",
      "You don’t know what this is going to cost, how long it’s going to take.\n",
      "Then again, obviously it depends on the subject.\n",
      "Whether or not the therapy is working on the person.\n",
      "Interviewer: Are there any other questions that you would want to know before we started the CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: It may be helpful to kind of give people an idea of what is the therapy, because that was never really explained.\n",
      "It was like we go, we sit down in a room, we start asking questions, “who are you?\n",
      "What do you do?\n",
      "What’s going on with you?” and you never really find out “here’s how we’re going to treat you.”\n",
      "Now maybe that’s something that just happens between the parent and the therapist, so there was never really any discussion of that.\n",
      "Ultimately we did get to “okay there’s going to be some things that we will go over and over, then here’s some tricks to learn how to trick yourself basically into believing nothing’s really wrong.”\n",
      "So that might have been very useful.\n",
      "Interviewer: What was your involvement in CBT?\n",
      "What would be useful for other parents to know if it’s not different from what you’ve already shared?\n",
      "Speaker: My involvement in CBT primarily was ensuring that to a certain extent, and this was minimized, really, in my case, that I tried to get my daughter to do certain activities so that we could have this repetitive testing, if you will, going on.\n",
      "Because you just can’t walk into the session and expect your therapist to give a 45 minute to an hour “here’s what’s going to happen,” the kid leaves and the kid doesn’t do anything.\n",
      "If you can’t find a way to get your child to actually continue to challenge themselves, then they’re really not going to improve all that much.\n",
      "So, you’ve really got to, with the approval of the therapist, find a way to challenge your kid, push them on multiple occasions.\n",
      "We didn’t do it a lot, we could’ve pushed a lot more, but I was told, “You don’t want to do it too much, within limits.”\n",
      "I would bring up ideas.\n",
      "I would get an okay, “yeah that sounds like a good idea, do that.”\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you ever read or heard about any scientific research about CBT?\n",
      "Is it something we should talk about in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: I did not at all.\n",
      "I mean in all honesty I did not see coming here as being in any way, shape, or form threatening, although as I mentioned before, any time you talk about therapy, I could see from the perspective [17:56]\n",
      "in the future, that in the case of a parent, yeah there’s a little bit of stigma.\n",
      "“Why is my kid having to go to therapy?\n",
      "What did I do wrong?” That kind of a situation going on in my head.\n",
      "And we, my wife and I, did have some discussions on that.\n",
      "As it turns out, my mother in law is also a therapist in this area, so we got her feedback on some things.\n",
      "I don’t always agree with her.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. So these articles that you said you read, were they scientific papers, or were they kind of like an CNN article or New York Times kind of article?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "They're probably more New York Times.\n",
      "Every now and then, they might be something from a journal.\n",
      "The article my therapist gave me was from some journal.\n",
      "And so, if I get a reference to a journal article, I'd rather read that, or New York Times that I trust more than ...\n",
      "Psychology Today is like pop kind of stuff.\n",
      "I don't really pay as much attention to that as I would to the Times.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, when you hear the words \"hoarding disorder,\" what do you think about?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I think about my house.\n",
      "I think about uncontrolled obtaining and collecting a unmanageable amount of things.\n",
      "A total mess.\n",
      "And I think it's very sad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, that question kind of leads into our next section, which is going to be discussing distress and interference.\n",
      "And so, you mentioned that you find hoarding disorder sad.\n",
      "Does your behavior upset you at all, or does it get in the way of your daily life very often?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "My house really does upset me.\n",
      "Not to the point where ... especially because like I said, I have started and really accomplished quite a bit in six weeks, but it took me four years to call this person to help me, so I get upset.\n",
      "And what I ended up doing was really, I would go upstairs and sit in my front room where the computer was, or I'd sit on the bed in my bedroom, which I can only sit on half the bed because there's a pile of stuff on the other half of the bed.\n",
      "So I just sort of shut away into these little spaces, and read or knit or whatever, or work on the computer or play games on the computer, and just ignore it all, avoid it all.\n",
      "So again, I can't remember exactly if I'm answering what you're looking for.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so would you say there was ever a time that your hoarding got in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It gets in the way of me doing the needlepoint.\n",
      "The biggest thing, the biggest activity I want to do at home, that I cannot do right now, is my needlepoint and frames, because I don't have a good place to sit with my frame and my yarns and whatnot, and a stand for the frame, which would make it easier, which I have in a box.\n",
      "Of course, not opened yet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So then my next question is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "There's no way around it, you're going to have to get rid of some of this stuff, would that really upset you?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I would need a lot of time to prepare myself and get in the right mental state.\n",
      "Every once in a while I will throw something away and it will feel good but a lot of times it's just agonizing to throw something into the garbage.\n",
      "Could I do it if I absolutely had to?\n",
      "For most things, yes, but I would need a lot of time to get prepared and be able to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "To work through all the emotions, get myself prepared.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you say that you experience this distress when you throw something away, is it this sadness or you feel that you didn't, I guess, respect the item enough or you didn't get full use out of it?\n",
      "What kind of emotions are you, I guess exactly experiencing when you throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yeah, all of the above.\n",
      "A huge matrix of emotions to the point where you just sort of ... your brain almost fogs over.\n",
      "At the time you really have to take a lot of deep breaths and really ... and that's one of the things I do.\n",
      "If I really had to throw something away I didn't want to I'd have to go out and do some physical exercise and then get my deep breathing and my mind in place and then I would have to go through a huge amount to get prepared.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And so earlier you mentioned you don't have the best relationship necessarily with your sister but you mentioned that you have a book club, how did they feel about your hoarding problem?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I don't think they were terribly aware of it because I had things in reasonable shape in the only two rooms they saw.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So they didn't have access to the rest of the house at all?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Not at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "In fact, fortunately somebody had a toddler so I was able to put a blockade across the other part of the house so that the toddler didn't go down there and then so it was clearly off limits to go there.\n",
      "And people don't just charge into the rest of your house in the book club.\n",
      "They just come and sit in the living room where the chairs are set up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "And then we have something to eat so I needed to have ... it was good to have the dining room table so the food and stuff could go there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So then you've never really had any other arguments about this besides with your sister?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So sometimes I feel like I can't even do hoarding correctly.\n",
      "I'm good at delegating work things and stuff like that.\n",
      "But the part about, I feel like I could do it if I had the availability are just pull everything out of one room and go back in it and then put it back and then destroy whatever I don't need and do the three bosses or whatever.\n",
      "So I haven't quite figured that out yet on how to do that.\n",
      "But I desperately want to do that.\n",
      "I desperately want to be better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like hoarding disorder is stigmatized?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Definitely, because of the fact that they put it on the show, they wouldn't put it schizophrenia on the show and make it into a prime time TV show.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Let's go ahead and chill, let's be a mass killer.\n",
      "Let's go to mercy kill people and then let's see if we can help them.\n",
      "So then it's like because like I hear people talking because they don't know if you have an issue with it and they're saying how disgusting their relative is and how could they live like that?\n",
      "And so that's the one person that you're not going to come by then as you listen to them and stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I just think it's just not necessarily looked into, but people have trivialized the issue because of the fact that it's like part of the mainstream culture to have it on television so it comes into people's homes.\n",
      "So it's trivialized.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "And what do you think of when you hear people talking about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Do you think of your own behavior or do you think of the television show?\n",
      "What springs to mind?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Well because it depends on if they're talking about somebody else and it all of a sudden has me feeling like we need to circle in a little bit and protect myself around that person.\n",
      "That if they're talking about the issue itself, then I might offer my two cents then about it.\n",
      "Sometimes the person can't help it or whatever like that.\n",
      "But it depends on how it's being discussed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So sometimes it makes you feel like you have to protect yourself because you don't want to be kind of lumped in to whatever it is they're talking about.\n",
      "But other times you feel like it's safer for you to kind of stick your head up and say \"Wow, it's really not their fault.'\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But it's not that you don't want to be lumped in.\n",
      "It's like prejudice in the sense that it's listening to people that don't have a final reference talking about it.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: That makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewee: And, I think that the defensiveness, I think that depends on how you’re interacting with them.\n",
      "So, I think as long as you’re not really dealing with the stuff, then that defensiveness wouldn’t be there.\n",
      "Kind of like if you get between a mama bear and her cub.\n",
      "If you get between, you know, someone and their clutter I think that’s when the defensiveness tends to come in, especially if they have a history of feeling more criticized and attacked by other people around the hoarding issues and with that not feeling heard or understood by them.\n",
      "They’ve kind of learned that they need to fight for their position and to fight for their stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: So, they’re feeling like the need to justify themselves right off the bat [INUADIBLE 60:44].\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Ok, I guess I’ll pick up with the next section which is about, we’re going to kind of return to one of the free listing prompts that talk about some of the explanations that patients with hoarding disorder might have for their behavior.\n",
      "And, the first thing we’d like you to do is just kind of think through some of the questions from an adapted version of the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale and we’d like you to just think about your patients and try to think about what, in your experience, your patients would say in response to these questions from the Brown Assessment of Beliefs.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And so, for example, one of the questions is, “What do you think has cause you to have these behaviors and do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?” So, just from your time spent treating patients, what do you think your patients believe is causing their behaviors?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm, I’m thinking of a couple clients in particular where there’s a feeling that they need to either be able to control or compensate for a particular situation.\n",
      "So, if they were feeling insecure in their ability to complete whatever job it might be.\n",
      "So, with one client, she’s a doctor with someone else.\n",
      "She’s already feeling anxious and insecure and unsure of herself.\n",
      "You know, foreign born, you know, she’s a second wife, so how can she prove that she’s capable and confident and able to fit in?\n",
      "And, I think that they do come to the awareness that there is a psychiatric issue.\n",
      "I think it comes as they’re building their insight, recognizing both the depression and the anxiety that have contributed to their participating in the hoarding behaviors, going back decades.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: So, maybe it starts out with more of a, kind of, experiential cause and then over time as they begin to build insight they begin to realize that it’s more of a psychiatric cause.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right.\n",
      "And, I think they recognize that, kind of, the behaviors that have turned into hoarding behaviors.\n",
      "Maybe they already had a tendency toward it, but then maybe they got more overwhelmed, more stressed and just were not able to fully cope with it, and that’s when it started to more snowball and become a maladaptive and more disruptive behavior.\n",
      "That's the biggest activity it gets in the way of.\n",
      "Because you can sit and read anywhere, and it's pretty easy to sit and work on the computer or iPad or whatever you have at the moment.\n",
      "And so I think that's one reason I just close off up in the bedroom.\n",
      "So ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it ever impacted your work?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "It's frustrating.\n",
      "I'm sorry?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it ever impacted your work?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I missed that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Has it ever impacted your work life?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Yeah, it would ... I was the head of a computer department before I was the head of the math department, and kids would kid me about it, because when you teach programming in a High school, even a pretty big high school, you're the only one.\n",
      "So you have these same kids for four years, so they know you pretty well.\n",
      "And they would kid that they were going to bring a ...\n",
      "Oh, what do you call it?\n",
      "It's like a flame shooter, and get rid of the piles for me and stuff, because they knew I would laugh about it with them.\n",
      "So, it would get in the way of things, but I always did my job just fine, so it would just be ... I couldn't have a nice, neat, cleaner desk like so many people can manage.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, when your students teased you about it, did that really upset you?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "No, I was laughing with them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Because I liked my students.\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "And they were kidding me.\n",
      "They were not being mean.\n",
      "You can tell, pretty much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you mentioned earlier, when we were talking, you said that your friends are very supportive.\n",
      "Have they ever gotten upset with you over not being able to come over, or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "No, they're more ... any kind of upset, which isn't the right word, but any kind of reaction like that is more of a, \"I wish for you, you could do such and such\" kind of reaction.\n",
      "A very supportive, sympathetic reaction.\n",
      "And again, one of my friends is so amazingly organized, I cannot imagine how she does it, and she has always offered to come over and help if I wanted to.\n",
      "And other friends have offered, if there was anything they could do.\n",
      "So, they're not ... I don't even think they've been judgmental.\n",
      "Or if they have been, which I'm sure we're all judgmental to an extent, but not to me, they haven't been.\n",
      "They might be judgmental, but not in interacting with me.\n",
      "So, I'm very lucky that way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, they sound very supportive.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So this last question is kind of going to wrap it all up, but would you be really upset if someone just came and got rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I think they're the same.\n",
      "My hoarding had not changed until I fell last year, and I needed space, and then I started really concentrating.\n",
      "It sounds funny, on the hoarding shows it's like therapy.\n",
      "And I noticed that everybody in the hoarding TV shows denied that they were hoarders.\n",
      "So the first thing I guess is acceptance in my life, and I said, \"Okay, I think I just feel like...\" I always knew I was a hoarder, but I think in the last couple of years I finally accepted, \"Okay, you are a hoarder.\n",
      "You cannot see the word free.\"\n",
      "Because anybody who's have anything free came to my house.\n",
      "So I tried not to access any free sites anymore.\n",
      "I try to bypass free stuff on the street.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So then-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "So I just-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "It sounds like you are aware of triggers.\n",
      "I know that's important.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, now in the last two years I've decided, I mean, I always knew the trigger but I couldn't help myself.\n",
      "So it's even eating.\n",
      "Because I was deprived, if there's a bunch of food in front of me I have to eat it all, and now I just don't bring it home.\n",
      "So if I don't bring it home, I know I won't eat it, right?\n",
      "But if I order it, I eat it.\n",
      "I don't care if it feed 10, I will eat it.\n",
      "So it's almost like hoarding food, too.\n",
      "I do hoard food.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You do?\n",
      "That is one of...\n",
      "What items do you hoard?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Okay, I do hoard food.\n",
      "I do hoard clothes.\n",
      "I do hoard stuff.\n",
      "Anything-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you consider the most valuable, and how do you choose what to keep?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Right now I'm just dividing into, \"Does this have any...,\" I haven't gone into deeper levels, so I take a one and a ten, and I split it into five.\n",
      "If it's five and below, and has absolutely no sentimental value, like a spice jar, I will try and let that one item go.\n",
      "I will even sometimes, like as my brother, \"Do you think this has any value?\" And he goes, \"No.\"\n",
      "Because what's interesting about me, is on the opposite end I'm actually an organizer.\n",
      "I can do everybody else's hoarding.\n",
      "I have cleaned up enough work sites that they ask me to come out and clean it up.\n",
      "If I have no self-involvement, I know what's bad and good, and what I can keep.\n",
      "But if it belongs to me, I can't tell.\n",
      "I can't tell if it's worthy or not, so the most important things of course are family objects, and very-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Family objects, you consider the most important?\n",
      "049\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Okay. So, the first question before we get started is that ...\n",
      "So, now you know that this is investigating individuals and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And so our first question is, what term would you prefer we use when you're talking about your difficulties with clutter, and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "What term would I prefer?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "You can call it anything you want.\n",
      "You can call it \"hoarding.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Hoarding?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I'm not going to be insulted by anything.\n",
      "There no terms that are ...\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "And then, the next few questions are kind of just basic demographic questions.\n",
      "And so, we're just going to start off, what is your sex?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, you identify as male or female?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, do you identify yourself as Hispanic or Latino, or non-Hispanic and Latino?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Non.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, what is your highest degree of education?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I have two bachelor's and a master's, and part of another master's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, what is your approximate household income?\n",
      "It can be a range.\n",
      "So I have like 35,000 to 50,000, 50,000 to 100,000 ...\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "You're not going to believe this, but I have no idea.\n",
      "Since I retired, I haven't paid attention.\n",
      "So just use that first, 35 to 50.\n",
      "It's probably something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right, that's fine.\n",
      "And then, which geographic region best describes where you live in the US?\n",
      "Like northeast, Midwest, south, or west?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Northeast.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So, that was all of our free listing prompts that we have.\n",
      "And so this next section is going to be more conversation-style, and it's separated into five main sections that we're going to talk about.\n",
      "And so, this first one is going to be talking about behavior and treatment-seeking.\n",
      "And so, first question is, if you could please describe your hoarding disorder and how long it's been going on?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I think when I was a kid, I always kept stuff, but I could eventually spend a Saturday in my room and clean it up.\n",
      "And as I got older, I had ...\n",
      "I've always lived alone, so I was never neat.\n",
      "But again, in my apartment for the first few years, I could clean it up so that I could have company for dinner the next weekend or something like that.\n",
      "I could get stuff put away enough to have a living room and a dining room and a kitchen that I could entertain.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Can you repeat that one more time?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being inside their home?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "My friends know that I have ...\n",
      "Not all of them necessarily know what my place looks like but if somebody needs something and we're out somewhere, most of my friends know that I'm the one to ask, whether it be a Band-Aid or ... I keep a lot of stuff in my purse.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You would say maybe one way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home is if they have a lot of things on them at all times, even in public?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Actually, I just said that but I'm going to take that back because [crosstalk 00:38:33].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's perfectly okay.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I don't have a suitcase for a purse.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "No. Actually, I don't think that without looking inside their home unless you talk about it.\n",
      "People probably wouldn't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You would say it would be easier to tell if somebody has hoarding disorder by going inside their home and there really isn't a way to tell unless you do see the physical parts of their home?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You did mention that you've heard about hoarding disorder on the reality TV shows and such, are there any other places that you've gotten information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I mean, I've read literature on OCD so I know that it's part of OCD.\n",
      "For the most part, I think about those shows.\n",
      "I look at it and I think how can somebody live like that?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Is the show what comes to mind when you hear the word hoarding disorder or what other things come to mind when you hear those words?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I think the shows are what come to mind.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you think that your behavior with your difficulties with clutter do they upset you?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Upset me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Because I'm embarrassed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know that you've mentioned prior that you would like people to come over but it's difficult because you have to move things out of the way.\n",
      "Are there any other things in your daily life that you think your difficulties with clutter get in the way of?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Finding things that I need because maybe someone was coming, like the one that was coming to help me clean, and so I'd shuffle all the papers and stuff I was going through into one pile and then I end up having to go through the pile again to find the bill I was going to pay or something.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Well, I think there is the expiration date on that possible.\n",
      "Because I won't go back and stay in there.\n",
      "I'm not going to get this.\n",
      "And if it's something that I think that it is in good shape and I know definitely would get it, or if I can donate it or something like that, then I'll do it that way.\n",
      "But yeah, so to a certain extent there are things that have expiration dates where I will go back and again be like \"Man, you're not going to get that.\"\n",
      "Then I will change my mind and get rid of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So there's kind of a limit on-\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So if you were to explain it to someone who didn't know anything about these kinds of problems, how would you explain what you think the most important differences are between somebody who really has problems with hoarding and somebody who just saves stuff or who collect stuff or who just has a lot of things?\n",
      "What for you is the biggest difference?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "The difference would be I would tell that person it's part of being colorblind in the sense that you know that there are things that are different colors.\n",
      "However, physically are some kind of way chromosome is missing for you to be able to see clearly that this is the way to do things or that if this happens, it's going to accumulate to this.\n",
      "So it's part of being colorblind, it's something that you can't help.\n",
      "It's something that you're just wired a little bit differently and it doesn't decrease your value.\n",
      "It just means that there's something that stands in your way in order to see things clearer.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So in the same way, somebody might be color blind, it's like being stuffed blind, or you just don't ...\n",
      "In the same way someone just is hardwired not to be able to see colors, you just can't see the kind of chain that will lead you to acquiring too much stuff and having too much stuff.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "No one could come here.\n",
      "And my neighbor keeps saying, \"Well just get this cleared out.\n",
      "I'll come and we'll go boom, boom, boom, and it'll be all done and you'll feel so much better.\"\n",
      "But now that she's given up saying that because she said it so many times and now she can't ... she used to be able to come over for tea and now she can't even come in the house any more because it's gotten so bad and that's so wrong because ... I mean, once ...\n",
      "Then shelter-in-place happened so I've got a little break here to get ready and I want to use the shelter-at-home time to do this and at least get the living room, dining room cleared enough and then also the kitchen cleared enough so someone can come back and finish the work because it's not usable really.\n",
      "I mean I use it but nobody else could possibly use it like that.\n",
      "It's a rare skill.\n",
      "It's sort of like camping out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so does this behavior get in the way of your daily life and has it got in the way of something you really want then?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, yes, because I mean, it's my top number one goal is to accomplish this and my goal is each day to move ... my therapist is asking me to ... or suggesting I do baby steps but keep at it and make ...\n",
      "If you take enough baby steps you start getting progress and I think that makes sense but I'm not doing that and I think this whole shelter-in-place thing hasn't helped any, oddly enough.\n",
      "Other people have and I have friends that say, 'Oh, I cleaned out every closet in my house.\n",
      "I'm looking for projects,\" and I think, \"Come here\".\n",
      "There's not a clean closet in the house and you can't even sit down on the furniture or I can't put people in beds.\n",
      "I've got one, two, three, a bunch of beds that you can't even get into.\n",
      "So with my father's clothes, old clothes and at one time I did take a huge pile of my father's slacks down to my sisters and I just left them there and I never heard a peep from her.\n",
      "She didn't complain.\n",
      "She didn't say what she'd done about it but at least she stepped up about it and apparently she got rid of them or something.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Our communication wasn't good on that subject and I hesitate to bring it up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would it upset you if she told you that she had gotten rid of them?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I don't think I want to hear.\n",
      "I think, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "A little bit.\n",
      "Not, I mean, I know it's the right thing and I would never say anything bad about it but I would feel it inside my body, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: No, that’s good to know.\n",
      "When you first learned about the kind of therapy that we do here, do you remember what questions you had?\n",
      "What did you know about CBT prior to the sessions here?\n",
      "Speaker: I really didn’t know a lot about, again, the cognitive CBD… as far as what you did hear, my wife is a physician.\n",
      "I never had any fear about bringing my daughter here, although I will say that not really knowing initially what we were talking about, I think there is this stigma of, “Okay your daughter is going to go to therapy.”\n",
      "And right away, you think psychiatry, and you think drugs and you think WACKY PEOPLE.\n",
      "And you’re like, I grew up in a situation where I had a couple brothers who had comparable type issues to what my daughter’s experiencing, never thought a thing about it, and we basically just toughed right through it.\n",
      "You know, unless I think the child is speaking out or you have an adult who’s really perceptive to these kinds of things; my wife’s a physician, she may have noticed some things, but again it was my daughter who was willing to open up, whereas with a boy, they may not perceive that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So what kind of questions did you have then when you were coming in, if you could remember?\n",
      "Speaker: I really did not ask a lot of questions, and I was the one that brought her here.\n",
      "Matter of fact, out of the, I don’t know how many times we’ve been here, 10, 15, 20 times, my wife has only been here one time.\n",
      "Again, I wasn’t too worried about the therapy because I saw it strictly as being a sitting down and talking, and after the very first session I kind of got an idea of what was going to be transpiring in terms of okay, everything we’re trying to do is repetitive type situations with her anxiety disorder.\n",
      "If we’re doing this over and over then you get more used to it then you don’t get the anxiety of doing it, and you start to realize… of course she got taught techniques in dealing with anxiety, that’s it’s not as big an issue that you’re making it up to be internally.\n",
      "Interviewer: How much did you know about CBT from movies, the TV, the internet, or other people?\n",
      "Did any or all of it match your experiences?\n",
      "Speaker: Well I will say this, I don’t think anyone phrases what I have seen as CBT.\n",
      "I don’t hear them talking about it on TV.\n",
      "When you watch a movie, you don’t hear them talking about CBT.\n",
      "In other words, it is a phrase that people are not, I believe, familiar with.\n",
      "And as a result, you say CBD it sounds like a lot of other, you know, abbreviations.\n",
      "I don’t know if saying CBD is another way of saying therapy, maybe you just say therapy, or you know, coming up with a gentler, easier, kinder way to make people feel comfortable about what the subject matter is.\n",
      "Because to me, CBT didn’t mean anything\n",
      "Interviewer: Thinking about your experience, were there any parts of the therapy that were confusing?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: What would you want to tell someone who was about to start CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: I’m saying CBD not CBT.\n",
      "Interviewer: CBT: cognitive behavioral therapy.\n",
      "I know we’ve said it several times.\n",
      "Speaker: I was also in a medical background for a while.\n",
      "CBD meant something else different.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, okay.\n",
      "7:38: Speaker: I’m sorry, say the question again.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And, do you ever get patients who are in earlier stages of hoarding disorder or have been hoarding for less long?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I did have… In my current group, there are two clients who are younger than I am.\n",
      "Which, I’m like wait a second, wow I think this is the first time that’s ever happened.\n",
      "I do have some people that come in where it’s in the earlier stages and maybe they’ve had family members where there’s been a hoarding situation and they don’t want to go as far down the path.\n",
      "Or there’s been a couple people that I’ve worked with who were in their twenties and there was significant clutter that had been going on at that point probably for maybe fifteen years, and they were starting to feel that is was having an impact on their job options or potential relationships.\n",
      "That was enough of a motivator for them to try to get involved in some changes.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And just one more follow-up question, sorry [NAME 77:06].\n",
      "Just wondering if in the course of your, kind of, practice you had developed kind of a sense of the life course of hoarding disorder, like when it typically begins or if that seems to differ from patient to patient.\n",
      "Interviewee: I definitely see it beginning, I would say by early twenties, and it’s not necessarily in the threshold for it to be a diagnosis of hoarding disorder, but the patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are contributing to the accumulation.\n",
      "So, excessive notetaking in class and keeping the notes semester after semester, making audio recordings of the classes with the idea of going back and listening to them at some later point but never doing it.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And so, that’s pretty consistent that it starts that early?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think so, yeah.\n",
      "And, some individuals are even talking about as teenagers, just as they’re reflecting back.\n",
      "So, noticing that they’ve had consistent clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: [INAUDIBLE 78:26]\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, but it’s more… Some of it is when did they have the space and the opportunity to acquire, or when did they maybe get upset with their parents for discarding things?\n",
      "But, I definitely have people who are identifying it going back into teen years, but I can’t think of anyone looking back younger than that.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok, and you can go ahead [NAME 78:58].\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And so, I know that we discussed this a little as well in terms of the role that patients’ family and friends play in arriving at the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, and so are there relatives that are more often involved in this process?\n",
      "Interviewee: I feel like it ends up being siblings.\n",
      "And… I say with the seeking treatment a lot of times it’s the siblings and the spouses as well.\n",
      "I’m thinking back here… I feel like a lot of the times it’s… And with siblings I think pretty evenly between brothers and sisters, but it’s more as adults, “Has there been some kind of crisis?\n",
      "How can we step in?\n",
      "We don’t want, if parents are still alive, we don’t want this to be a burden for mom and dad to have to be dealing with, so how can we start to intervene more now?” And, then I think the spouses tend to be very involved as well.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Well, I'm a master so I can use every room.\n",
      "But there is an extra bedroom that you really need to balance yourself on, and I don't go in there too much.\n",
      "Every room has a path.\n",
      "The bathroom is immaculate.\n",
      "Believe it or not, I keep the bathroom spic-and-span.\n",
      "I think it's the germ thing.\n",
      "I'm also a germaphobe.\n",
      "Isn't that funny?\n",
      "I'm a germaphobe but I'm a hoarder.\n",
      "Everything I own is clean, it's just stacked.\n",
      "So, but my bathroom's immaculate.\n",
      "So my bathroom is not hoarded at all, so-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "There's nothing in there?\n",
      "No clutter.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah that, but the bedrooms, my master I've been slowly cleaning out, trying to, and the downstairs I started because the contractor says he can't work on it, so like I said, I go down there once a day or once a week and try and get a box, and I try to just judge it.\n",
      "\"Do I really need this?\n",
      "I haven't looked at in in 40 years.\n",
      "Will I ever need this again?\" I even had an employee...\n",
      "I'm a supervisor, and I had an employee record, and he'd passed away two years ago, so he's never going to contest anything I said or did with him, and I finally was able to shred his papers, because that's the final act.\n",
      "He passed away, right?\n",
      "So I was able to get down some boxes out of there, which I'm never going back to that work, so...\n",
      "But I can tell I've made a change.\n",
      "Instead of ten tenths of being hoarded I am not nine tenths, and even some days eight tenths, and some days seven tenths.\n",
      "I'm not below a seven yet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm glad you're feeling better about your progress.\n",
      "Also you mentioned, since you said there are no rooms that aren't blocked, are there different objects or parts of your home that you aren't able to use in the way that they were intended?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Such as your bathtub, or your stove?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes?\n",
      "Can you tell that?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes, please.\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewee: So, uh, well let’s see so…I guess that allows me to also diagnose obsessive compulsive disorder but I think that quite a, a good, a fairly high percentage of OCD patients have some hoarding but it may not rise to the level of hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And I’ve rarely seen hoarders who don’t have a few typical OCD symptoms.\n",
      "Sometimes there’s some overlap that makes me wonder if I should be diagnosing OCD, or hoarding disorder, or both.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you ever have trouble with other potentially commonly comorbid conditions like depression?\n",
      "Do you find that that is uh…\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I mean, that is self-evident if it’s present.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So mostly it’s kind of maybe not a cross-over but an overlap between OCD symptoms, which many hoarders display, and hoarding?\n",
      "Is that correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah that’s correct.\n",
      "Interviewer: How do you make the decision as to which diagnosis is kind of predominant or primarily…\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, to me, if they meet criteria for both independently, I’ll give them both diagnoses.\n",
      "To me, for hoarding disorder to be diagnosed, it really has to be a preponderant problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: If it’s just some minor hoarding, I’ll chalk that up to OCD.\n",
      "Interviewer: I’d like to return to the part of the DSM five that talks about congesting and cluttering active living areas and compromising intended use of the person’s space.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah ok.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you, do you…How do you make that determination, not just because you can’t see their space, but considering things like home size where someone might inhabit quite a small space like a trailer and fewer possessions would clutter their space relative to someone who has, you know, a really large house or the ability to buy a storage unit.\n",
      "So do you ever take that into account or how does that affect?\n",
      "Interviewee: That doesn’t seem to be a problem with the diagnosis because if people have tiny homes and they’re otherwise neat and tidy, you know, the behavior of hoarders is so distinctive that it’s hard to confuse that with someone who simply doesn’t have a lot of space available.\n",
      "The person without much space might, you know, it’s still gonna be neat and tidy, stack things up carefully, and fold things carefully, or box them up.\n",
      "Hoarders just tends to kind of throw things around and clutter the space and they don’t necessarily tidy up very well.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you think that…\n",
      "Interviewee: So now, now I’m not seeing this but I ask patients, you know, would I be horrified if I saw your home?\n",
      "If you invited me over to your home, what would I say?\n",
      "What would I see?\n",
      "Describe it to me.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sounds good.\n",
      "Now that we’ve talked about both of those, the last thing is what should we decide that they talk about in the video?\n",
      "We’ve already started talking about this with the other questions, but what questions about CBT do our characters need to ask and answer within the video?\n",
      "Should they find out a CBT explanation about how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life?\n",
      "Speaker: I think you can talk about that, but you have the person talking about the kind of experiences they have.\n",
      "Because some people may not even… again, I didn’t even really know, and I would dare say there’s a lot of kids… and you hate to think there’s that many people out there who have issues.\n",
      "Again, I think there’s a stigma attached and without question, I know there is because I know a couple other docs, my daughter has told me that their kids… you know, “this kid had a problem” and mother says “maybe you should stay away from that person if they’re being depressed,” or you know there’s a stigma attached with this.\n",
      "We’re seeing a therapist.\n",
      "Honestly, I’m not sure if we’re seeing a PhD OR Master’s level therapist or not psychiatrists… correct?\n",
      "They’re not psychiatrists… I don’t know... maybe they are, I never looked at their diploma.\n",
      "So I think there is somewhat of a stigma attached with this to a lot of people.\n",
      "That’s what you’re going to have to breakthrough; in that it’s not that difficult, it’s not that uncommon.\n",
      "You don’t need to be scared of it.\n",
      "People don’t like to say, “Oh yeah I’m in therapy,” or my daughter’s mentioned that, because the first thing that some of the kids think is, “Ooh, stay away from her, she’s got a problem.”\n",
      "Interviewer: So is that something you’d want to be discussed in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: I think you do need to talk about that.\n",
      "There’s some potential risk there, so you need to basically limit who you’re going to talk to because stuff gets around.\n",
      "I was even told, “don’t tell the rest of the family.\n",
      "We don’t want them thinking negatively of what’s going on.”\n",
      "Then again to me, it was like, “What are we talking about here?” This doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, but yet it is.\n",
      "If you’re that person that’s in therapy you’re thinking about what everyone else is thinking about your family.\n",
      "You go on a trip, you see the other half of the family, and its like, “what’s going on with you?\n",
      "I heard you’re in therapy.”\n",
      "Negative connotations just spread.\n",
      "People can say things.\n",
      "They can be very hurtful, so there needs to be some thought given to that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Should they ask about how it has worked for other kids?\n",
      "Speaker: I would say so.\n",
      "Having examples of kids who could, again in an educational setting, stand up and basically say, “Here’s the problems that I had.\n",
      "I was afraid of doing this.\n",
      "I couldn’t do this, I couldn’t do that, and fortunately I talked to my mother about it… blah blah blah blah… this is what happened, and I got into this program, and it helped me to deal with it.\n",
      "I still have it to a certain extent, but I know how to deal with it, and now I can go around doing A, B, C, D, and E, and I’m okay.\n",
      "My life has expanded greatly.”\n",
      "I think you want to show that kind of positive type situation.\n",
      "Transcription paused by Aqueena @\n",
      "Interviewer: Should they ask about how exposures work?\n",
      "Speaker: Ask about how exposures work… okay since you can’t answer a question….\n",
      "Interviewer: Should they ask about the activities or the homework’s that is usually given and the need to do it outside?\n",
      "Should they ask about that?\n",
      "Speaker: Ask the therapist?\n",
      "Yes…\n",
      "And I would find things that had belonged to me in my parents' house, that they were using.\n",
      "That they kept, effectively stolen from me when I was in jail.\n",
      "And they're not bad people.\n",
      "They're, that's a source of frustration.\n",
      "And also, we moved like every few years.\n",
      "My dad was military.\n",
      "And just discarded, effectively moving, changing your life entirely.\n",
      "And I went to nine schools in 12 years.\n",
      "I moved 14 times.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "But the thing is, in my circumstances, that was normal.\n",
      "I lived with other people who did the same thing.\n",
      "Surrounded by people for whom this is normal.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So out of all of your things, what's trash for you, and what do you discard?\n",
      "And how do you decide when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "When I'm going through things, and I perceive that it's not usable, I'll just shred it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "If it's something that evokes a negative association, or a negative memory, I'll sometimes discard it.\n",
      "If it's worn, if I already have other replacement, if I can't think of a use, even though, with all my projects and stuff.\n",
      "There's a microwave that broke, [inaudible 00:46:36] microwave.\n",
      "But I looked, and it turns out that a microwave has a lot of great parts, a lot of things you can do cannibalizing a microwave.\n",
      "I haven't gotten around to it yet.\n",
      "I have the old microwave in a corner to do that anyway.\n",
      "But I don't know.\n",
      "A lot of it-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so when-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "When I have to, yeah, when I have to do it, when I have to make it look orderly or pass for an inspection, in those 24 hours, I am hyper PTSD, stressed out, and then I make, I get rid of things because they take up too much space.\n",
      "They don't fit.\n",
      "Yeah, things that I would otherwise keep, but I realize that I have a few hours.\n",
      "I have to get this done.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So things can be discarded if they're worn, they carry negative emotions, they're unusable, things of that sort, yeah.\n",
      "I get that.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I travel a lot, too.\n",
      "And invariably, when I come back, I'll have the airline tickets, the luggage stickers, all the flyers and things of the trips we went on, like Iceland, the horses and the ice cave, and all that kind of stuff.\n",
      "And I keep that.\n",
      "Intending to, for no good reason.\n",
      "But I intend, at some point, to make a collection of that.\n",
      "Have a, like an album or whatever to show my travels.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Because then I could see them.\n",
      "But yeah, it can take up time.\n",
      "And when you're trying to throw things away and you go through that, you end up having to deal with each one of them piece by piece, it makes the two weeks fly by.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Well, I have some demographic questions for you, and then I want to make sure to get your address.\n",
      "And I can send you a gift card to say, thank you for your time on the phone with me today and last week.\n",
      "It's up to you if you would prefer to receive an electronic gift card by email, we can send you it right away.\n",
      "Or we can put a Visa gift card for you in the mail.\n",
      "Do you have a preference?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "No, I'd rather have one in the mail.\n",
      "I don't have a printer that's working now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You don't need a printer.\n",
      "You could just use it on Amazon or whatever to buy things online.\n",
      "But if you don't buy things online, then it's better to send you something in the mail.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "No, I think I'd really have one sent to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So I'm just going to ask you the demographic questions.\n",
      "So I'm going to go ahead and guess that you're female.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "No, I'm not taking any medications at all anymore, except Synthroid, but that's a different thing.\n",
      "Anyway, at that...\n",
      "May have some, who knows.\n",
      "But anyway, so initially they started me on Prozac, but I became violent.\n",
      "I mean, really violent.\n",
      "I was normal for a month or six weeks, and then suddenly I got the strength of Hercules, lift up a bench.\n",
      "I actually picked up a bench which weighed about 80 pounds and threw it out the front window.\n",
      "That's how mad I was getting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes, even I could be-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You must be very strong.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah, very strong.\n",
      "I was like, \"Where did this come from?\" And I knew it was the Prozac, so I got off of that, and then the gave me Alprazolam, and then they gave me...\n",
      "There's a couple of others they gave me.\n",
      "If I see them I know them.\n",
      "Some other things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I know they gave me Ritalin at one time, the generic form of Ritalin, and tried a couple of other things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When did you stop taking any of these-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "About ten years ago.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Ten years ago.\n",
      "Have you-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I broke up, by the way.\n",
      "I broke up with my other half 10 years ago.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, I remember you saying that.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "So that, I stopped taking it 10 years ago, because I figured I had to work on myself, and then my psychiatrist died, he passed away.\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You didn't think the medications were helping you with the self-improvement.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "I think it wasn't helping me with the hoarding at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "It did calm me down if I was having some kind of, not OCD, but episode.\n",
      "I would find I was screaming at my ex.\n",
      "It did calm me down, but then I always felt like I was in a fog, like I was underneath something-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's very common.\n",
      "I know a lot of people feel that way.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "... being held down.\n",
      "And then when I stopped taking it I felt like me again, but then you had to live with me.\n",
      "So the chances of living with me are not...\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "Are good, so-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So now would you say your problems with hoarding are comparatively over the course of your lifespan, and when you were on medication, when you were with your ex, would you say that they're better or worse than they used to be, or about the same?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "So, well the dining room table, can't use that.\n",
      "The coffee table in the living room, you can't use that.\n",
      "The third bedroom, you can't use at all.\n",
      "There's an ironing board in there stacked with a million clothes.\n",
      "No, you can't use that at all.\n",
      "There's nothing I can get into there, unless I start de-cluttering.\n",
      "The stairwell was getting a little too tight for me.\n",
      "When I fell, it was obvious I would not be able to walk down.\n",
      "We had to put in a second rail, and it was obvious that I would not be able to walk down those stairs unless I got rid of some of the stuff.\n",
      "So just on need alone...\n",
      "And what I'm trying to do is devalue the items.\n",
      "So if I take it out of the family room and put it in my basement and let it sit there for a while, I have now relegated to the basement.\n",
      "To me the basement is mostly trash.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mostly trash?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's like-\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "It's a two-car garage, but I can only barely squeeze one car in there.\n",
      "But I've devalued it to a, if it's in there I can get rid of it, so why am I keeping it?\n",
      "Now some things I do get rid of.\n",
      "Like I said, the broken snippers by the garbage can that I haven't been able to dump them in there.\n",
      "I'm just waiting for my ex to come around and give me a new pair.\n",
      "We'll see how I progress on this.\n",
      "I'm dying to go home and get rid of that spice jar, but I'll have to see when I get home today if I feel the same, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it does sound like you feel your home is cluttered, would you say that?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "What would you ideally like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Well, before, at one point I had a couple of friends that I would invite over, and even some of them stayed, and I don't know how I left...\n",
      "Oh, I hoarded the garage.\n",
      "They never went into the garage.\n",
      "But the rest of the house was pretty immaculate.\n",
      "Someone stayed in my family room downstairs.\n",
      "Someone stayed in my extra bedroom upstairs.\n",
      "Not the back one, that one was still hoarded.\n",
      "The kitchen was immaculate.\n",
      "You could eat off the dining room table.\n",
      "I used to have my brother over for family dinners.\n",
      "So obviously those were all okay.\n",
      "I think I'd like to be able to invite people back.\n",
      "So then I'm not embarrassed, you know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So you would just like to de-clutter them a bit more?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: That makes sense.\n",
      "Ok, and so just one more of these things for you to think through, again, thinking about how your patients might answer this question.\n",
      "“How convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding?” How do you think your patients would answer that question?\n",
      "“How convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding?”\n",
      "Interviewee: I think a lot of them would say, like percentage wise maybe 60% convinced, and depending on how they would define something bad.\n",
      "Would it be the end of the world?\n",
      "No. But, would they feel discomfort, would they feel bad about it?\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "And so, it would be survivable, but they’d still rather not deal with that uncomfortable feeling in the first place.\n",
      "You know, they’ll kind of say, “If you pushed me I could get rid of it and I’m sure I’d be fine, but I’d feel bad and I’d rather not go through that experience.”\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm.\n",
      "So, less something would happen to them and more they would experience it negatively.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, it would more just be the emotional experience rather than “if I didn’t have this my family would disown me,” or some external consequence.\n",
      "So, “if I don’t keep all of these reports my boss will fire me.”\n",
      "Interviewer 2: I’m kind of thinking about those explanations in the list that we generated earlier of reasons that people might give for hoarding behaviors.\n",
      "Do you think that these are post hoc reasons to justify kind of an underlying pathological need or do you think that they are, in some sense, real reasons?\n",
      "So, you know, reasons that people give for hoarding, are they post hoc justifications versus actual reasons, and how do you go through that idea?\n",
      "Interviewee: I’d say, you know, kind of similar to the way you think about an OCD, an obsessive thought with a related compulsion.\n",
      "There’s a grain of truth to it but that grain is now lost in a whole sand, like a whole beach of sand.\n",
      "So, I think when you talk about hoarding clients, often I might, one item at a time, “Ok, I can see a reason for wanting to do that.\n",
      "Ok.”\n",
      "To a point that makes sense, but it’s taken to such an extreme, that’s where it becomes more problematic.\n",
      "So, yes, I could understand wanting to hold on to an old vehicle registration because there’s a chance you might need to prove when you had the vehicle or something.\n",
      "But, if you’re holding onto it, it’s from 20 years ago… now it’s getting too involved.\n",
      "Now it’s an exaggeration of what did have a piece of… I don’t want to say what made sense because there was a part in there that would have been on the continuum of more typical decision-making behavior, then it went further than that and then it got distorted.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "But it wasn't like I intently watched it either.\n",
      "It's like, okay, I'm leaving.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Anywhere else?\n",
      "Maybe internet or books or any of that sort?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I haven't looked it up on the internet.\n",
      "I'm sure I must have read articles about it if I came across one I suppose.\n",
      "But some reason I don't think it would be interesting to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I understand.\n",
      "And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "It sounds greedy.\n",
      "It sounds a little deranged.\n",
      "It's not a good thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, just thinking about your issues and difficulties with collecting treasures, does your behavior upset you?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Makes me feel good when I'm doing it.\n",
      "But then it's just more obligations stacking up.\n",
      "Because I've got disperse with, do something useful with or return it, which doesn't easily happen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, it feels good when you're keeping your items but maybe looking at everything from an outsider backwards picture it just seems like more of an obligation, more to deal with.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Can you describe a time where your behavior has gotten in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I've got a lot of paperwork to file, some legal things, that I know I had all ready to go and I cannot find it.\n",
      "And I don't know if it's in one of these boxes and my daughter-in-law tried to help me by putting everything in boxes, just put everything in a box add to the pile to make it a little cleaner in here or not.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I just haven't come across it yet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it's getting in the way of some of that legal paperwork because it's gotten lost.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yeah, I know there's things that I have worked on and that I can't find.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "I know you mentioned that your behavior is upsetting to your son and he might be mad at you right now, which I'm sorry about.\n",
      "Do you think it's ever impacted any other family or romantic relationships?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, would you just say it's mostly impacted your relationship with your son?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about work?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I don't work anymore.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say before, when you were working, it affected it in any way?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I don't think I was terribly organized.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Would you like to change your behavior?\n",
      "Why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I would be more comfortable if it were changed.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "It would be less messy.\n",
      "It would be less dangerous.\n",
      "It would be more socially acceptable.\n",
      "And it would simplify, which as we all hear now, simplifying makes you feel better.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, so now that we talked about that, we need to decide where they talk, the environment; so the setting.\n",
      "Would it be home, school, a doctor’s office, or maybe somewhere outside like a park?\n",
      "What settings are you thinking of?\n",
      "Speaker: That uh, every setting is the opening to the story.\n",
      "So you know, not in an office.\n",
      "It’s like who wants to watch?\n",
      "I did many commercials in my life and I think outdoors, I think where everyone is relieved to look at something.\n",
      "Who feels relieved when they walk into a doctor’s office or in a room like this?\n",
      "You know, I mean like when we did commercials it always had to be a colorful, bright, cheery atmosphere to begin with.\n",
      "Then you could put anything into that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So after we talked about that, let’s talk more about what the characters would talk about in the video.\n",
      "Right, so we’ve talked about CBT, but what would we want, what should they find out about the CBT explanations?\n",
      "How should they talk about, like would you want to hear them ask questions about how CBT has worked for other kids?\n",
      "Speaker: A little bit.\n",
      "You know I would like to see examples.\n",
      "You know examples of; like I said my son was stuck because he put his bag down and it was all messed up and he tried looking at it and looking at it because it wasn’t to his standards.\n",
      "You know I’d like to see him put his book down, glance at it and that’s it.\n",
      "The result of it you know and it’s like I did a commercial once and they booked me as the assistant director in the commercial and they couldn’t get it done and it was about a girl coming up a pool very sexy and they wanted to see things from her but it was a minor, I think the girl was only sixteen, even though she looked like she was twenty.\n",
      "And they couldn’t get the look on her face without talking about sex or anything that was part of it.\n",
      "So jumped in the pool with her and we were talking and getting to know each other and finally I said “ok” and this was in the swamps too so it wasn’t a pool and I said “ok hey you know the feeling of you taking a nice hot shower and your coming out of the water, you know how that feels?\n",
      "Now come out of the water and feel like someone just turned the cold water on you.\n",
      "Let’s see your face” And we did it and instantly we got the shot.\n",
      "And the director said “you didn’t talk about anything sexy Sid?” and I said “No I didn’t” you see that look; that shiver that she had came from that.\n",
      "And so just looks, in a commercial, in visual things, you can do so many things so quickly, so easily.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you think that the video should talk about the explanation of how, the CBT explanation of how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes it should be in there, it should be in there.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you believe that they, the characters in the video should discuss how exposures work?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, but that’s putting an awful lot in there.\n",
      "I mean for example.\n",
      "My son would put his phone, whatever, right here and I can see him sitting there, looking at it.\n",
      "Then the next scene I could see him putting a leg up, knocking over, catching it and just holding it and putting it and all of the sudden he doesn’t even look at it anymore.\n",
      "He caught it and was like wow what a difference?\n",
      "Sitting there, staring at it.\n",
      "I mean you can do so much with video, so quickly.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I would like to be, I mean, I even would like some rooms to be almost minimalist, even like your ... think of a magazine, a shot of a modern home that's all very ... only a few pieces of furniture and possibly not even any carpet, a very modern home.\n",
      "I'd like to have a little bit of that.\n",
      "I'd also like to have some cozier rooms but I would like all rooms to be in the golden mean, in the middle, not ... some of those rooms it's okay if there are things out, a little bit out, I think that's fine but I would like it to be much more in the center of the way most people would be.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and when you say cozier-\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Or more normal.\n",
      "Something in a magazine where you could flip open and they'd have some things around, not totally staged and styled, but just a normal home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and when you say cozier-\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "And I know normal is an impossible word to use but ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so-\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Do you have a feel for what I'm saying?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I think I'm getting it now.\n",
      "So how important would you say your things are for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Which objects are the most important ones that you spend most of your time with?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Probably books, most of my time with books and magazines.\n",
      "And then I have ... my worst problem is with mail that comes in.\n",
      "I, myself, don't bring in too much stuff but the mail comes and I just can't seem to get it processed and get rid of it and so box after box after box starts stacking up of more incoming mail.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, do you often miss bill payments then if you don't get through the mail in time?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "No, not often.\n",
      "I try to get bills paid immediately when they come in so that I don't lose them and then I will file those away once they get paid.\n",
      "I have files of paid bills for way too many years.\n",
      "I mean, there's no reason to keep them for 10 years or 20 years and then financial statements, things like that, I know that you can get ... but you see, you can get it from online but I actually need data from before ... they're actually ... see this is a question of need.\n",
      "There are things in here that I need, it's just that it's so disorganized I can't get to what it is I do need, therefore I don't throw out more things because ... and then it makes it harder to get to what you really do need.\n",
      "Interviewer: So um, Should they ask about what parents can and can’t do to help in the video?\n",
      "Should that be something discussed in the video?\n",
      "Speaker: That’s in every video, every video today.\n",
      "Parent approval, you know.\n",
      "And it’s like, we over; we over-parent out kids anyway.\n",
      "So I don’t know if it has to be in there.\n",
      "I in some way, yes as a role model in a way, but not you know “you should do this and not this” and they mock, kids mock that all the time.\n",
      "Interviewer: So now there’s a fun part of the series of videos.\n",
      "How do we decide, we get to decide how the video will look like, but first let me ask you before I show you some options: What kind of animated films or cartoons do you like to watch?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, gee anything that’s entertaining and witty.\n",
      "You know like they put an old Mickey Mouse cartoon on, it’s like you’ve seen it, you know you can glance at it and enjoy it.\n",
      "But you know something that challenges you and you know “what is this?” (22:02)\n",
      "....\n",
      "It’s fascinating, like I said I’ve done lots of commercials and I’ve been in a couple of movies, I’ve been a ballet dancer my whole life, so I’ve done lots of filming in lots of different locations.\n",
      "I’ve been to twenty three countries, I’ve been all over the world and it’s amazing what visual arts can do.\n",
      "With basically not saying a word.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "So I’m going to give you these options.\n",
      "There’s three options here with different styles.\n",
      "There’s the line art style, there’s a vector art style, and there’s a live action style.\n",
      "So looking at these styles, I’ll give you a few seconds, or a few minutes to look over it.\n",
      "Speaker – I don’t need minutes\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So if you don’t need minutes I’ll give you a few seconds to look over and it and tell me which one stands out to you and which one you like?\n",
      "Speaker: The movement, the girl with an image, the girl with that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well not with the movement but with the style.\n",
      "As you can see this one has more line art.\n",
      "Words are popping out more.\n",
      "Motion graft texts aid in delivering the content.\n",
      "The next one you have more of a cartoon-like structure where there’s live-action video illustrated with drawings.\n",
      "And then the last one is more so like a blend with comic art and live action.\n",
      "So it’s more action packed kind of style to it.\n",
      "Given these three which one would you like to see from the video that we would be developing.\n",
      "Speaker: The first one, I like this.\n",
      "The second one, I like this.\n",
      "The third one, I like this.\n",
      "Interviewer: If you had to choose one option that, one style for this video, which one of the three options would you choose?\n",
      "24:17-Speaker: I mean is this acceptable?\n",
      "There’s only three at the bottom.\n",
      "Interviewer: They’re just examples of how else….\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you like option 1?\n",
      "Speaker: For instance, you’re balancing.\n",
      "You’re balancing, you can be thinking of so many things while you balance or you can be thinking about nothing, and balance.\n",
      "Which one makes it easy?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So option 1 sounds like the one for you.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok with that being said, what do you think the take-home message of the video should be?\n",
      "Speaker: I want to see it again.\n",
      "I like that.\n",
      "I wish I could see it again.\n",
      "Interviewer: That should be the take home message?\n",
      "Speaker: Absolutely.\n",
      "Because if you want to see something again, you’re really interested in it.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, I just kind of think that ...\n",
      "I've read too about people having ... they attribute it to abuse in your past and all sorts of different subconscious problems that you've had growing up, and it exhibits that way.\n",
      "I've explored that kind of thing.\n",
      "It's so weird because sometimes I can totally let go of my stuff, and other times it's just like ...\n",
      "My daughter-in-law asked me for a jar of agates and I couldn't give them to her.\n",
      "That's like my very, very, very favorite thing.\n",
      "I was like, \"What are you going to use them for?\"\n",
      "Usually I can give people anything, but that's my thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's one of your ... yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "My son always, because he knows how much I love all this stuff, he told me, when I die, he's just going to take all of it and just scatter it all over the beach.\n",
      "I'm like, oh I guess I'll have to give it to someone else before I go then, because I was hoping he'd hang on to some of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "But he kind of learned from her that you don't hold on to things.\n",
      "That's the way you really should be.\n",
      "Things should kind of come and go, flow through.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You just have trouble parting with your favorite things.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, and other things, a whole house full of things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Okay, well those are all the questions I have for you.\n",
      "Now I'm just going to ask you a couple of very easy demographic questions.\n",
      "So of course, if you don't want to answer these, that's completely up to you.\n",
      "Can you tell me your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your race?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Ethnicity?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Polish.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your household income?\n",
      "A range is all right.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, it's kind of tricky.\n",
      "This year it was 50,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your geographic region, so northeast-\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Pacific northwest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and your highest level of education, although you've mentioned.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Bachelors degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay, my last question is if you prefer an electronic Amazon gift card or a physical Amazon gift card by mail.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "If I have a physical one, can I still use it online?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, I'll do that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "So thank you again for participating.\n",
      "We really appreciate your help as we try to-\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Do you have my address?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Interviewer will most likely email you for it.\n",
      "I just don't want to have it on the recording.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So again, we really appreciate this.\n",
      "If you have any questions, you can email Interviewer and she'll be happy to answer any questions for you.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Am I going to get some ... they said something about a transcript of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I actually don't know, but you can definitely email her.\n",
      "We're still going to be transcribing this within the week, but if you do want any of the research that we come up with with this study, we can definitely give those to you, although it might take a little bit of time.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Is it still ongoing?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, this is an ongoing project.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "You guys have been going for a while because I've ...\n",
      "Were you the group that took blood from me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I actually don't know about that.\n",
      "We just started interviewing people this week, so it's relatively new.\n",
      "I just came onto this a couple of weeks ago, but you can definitely email Interviewer if you do have any other questions that I can't answer.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, well thank you so much and have a great day, and stay safe.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Okay, thank you.\n",
      "You too.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Then also I do see the dog that I gave to her and then a picture pretty much every day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Would you say that these items that are related to your mother and father are what make you feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I used to watch the show about tiny houses.\n",
      "I used to think that that would be so nice and that basically it would be like I could start over again.\n",
      "I know that wouldn't happen but I would just like to have it so that pretty much stuff is clear and away in cabinets and whatever and that I wouldn't have to be embarrassed if people come.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Wanting just an open clear space where everything has a place, everything is organized?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I also have a lot of stuff that's out because when I'm working on a project ...\n",
      "There's 175 residents where I live and I'm making cloth face masks for everyone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "That's amazing.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I have all the stuff out so that my sewing machine is on the tray table and I've got fabric everywhere.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's really amazing that you're doing that.\n",
      "When you think about your possessions, how do you define whether or not something is valuable?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I'm not really sure.\n",
      "It's like sometimes I will decide, okay, I can get rid of this.\n",
      "I used to do woodworking.\n",
      "I'm not in a position where I can do any kind of saw or anything but yet it was so hard to get rid of the saws and stuff like that, even though I knew I'd never use them again.\n",
      "I would put them in a box and then I would tell my organizer that she had to take it that day for fear that I would take it out of there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, do you think that those saws were considered valuable to you?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I don't know about valuable.\n",
      "It's just that maybe I was thinking that I was going to one day return to be able to do that stuff.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, because they were tied to something that you really enjoyed?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you're thinking about your possessions, do you base their value off of monetary, off of them being a family-related object?\n",
      "When you see your possessions and you decide mentally, \"Okay, this is valuable to me\" how do you go through that process?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "It's more emotionally related.\n",
      "I don't think I have anything that's really valuable as far as money-wise.\n",
      "A lot of the stuff it's stuff that can't be replaced like pictures and stuff that I have.\n",
      "You wouldn't be able to go buy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Things that have an emotional and important connection to you, those would be valuable?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "No. Some of the things that I get are you know how people look at info marshals, and they buy all the exercise equipment?\n",
      "And it's not that they're going to use it, but they're buying it for the lifestyle that they see that they want.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "They want to be a person.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "They want to be a person that exercises.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And so the stuff that's in my house has the tendency to be the stuff that how I basically want my life to be like.\n",
      "My mom is watching this movies, oh yes.\n",
      "I love me.\n",
      "And in there she and her husband and she says \"I don't know.\n",
      "I don't think our life is ever going to get started.\"\n",
      "And he said to her \"ut honey Holly, you're already in your life.\n",
      "It has already started.\"\n",
      "And so I think that I keep waiting for my life to start where everything that I've purchased is going to fall into place the way that I see that it would.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's not so much about your items helping you feel at home.\n",
      "It's more that you're waiting to be a person who will use them.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Good job.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm trying to get better at it.\n",
      "I want to make sure I'm not putting words in your mouth.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "No, you're doing good.\n",
      "You're doing good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So what are the items in your home that you feel like you spend the most time with, or that you use the most, you engage with the most?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Obviously my DVDs, my television and my microwave.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So most of the stuff that you have, you don't actively engage with?\n",
      "It's mostly that you watch TV [crosstalk 00:33:05].\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Except for getting dressed for work and stuff, trying to find something that looks appropriate or that I just didn't roll over.\n",
      "Which a lot of times I do just roll over and just go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you wear the clothes that you have in your home?\n",
      "Do you go through them to wear them or are they mostly just being stored?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Oh yeah, definitely go through to find.\n",
      "I feel like every other thing well.\n",
      "Every other single female adults do and look for things that are clean and I don't have to iron that I could just throw on because I want to sleep a little bit longer instead of doing something to prepare to get dressed.\n",
      "So, yeah.\n",
      "So I do wear my stuff and I do go through to find what to wear, it's just that sometimes things get on top of each other and then I forget that I had, and I go, \"Oh, I forgot I owned that.\n",
      "Oh, I'm going to wear that thing.\"\n",
      "Like that.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Mostly just, yeah.\n",
      "Personal research and directed research.\n",
      "I get two or three emails about hoarding or about ADD, and hoarding was one of the issues of that, and a comorbidity of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And what do you think-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I keep up with traumatic brain injuries, [inaudible 00:53:19], and concussions, dailies, certain developments and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what do you think about when you hear the words, hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "My first thought is the old lady that has 40 cats in her house, you know?\n",
      "The lady who takes in stray cats and has 40 or 60 of them in the house.\n",
      "I knew a woman who did that.\n",
      "And she can't welcome anyone in.\n",
      "The whole house smells like cat piss, you know?\n",
      "It's just way too much, however good her intentions were, the reality that she's formed around her, is the nasty, unpleasant, dangerous form.\n",
      "That's the extreme of that I think of when I hear hoarding, that's what I think of first.\n",
      "I knew a woman who literally did this.\n",
      "I didn't know she was doing it while she was doing it.\n",
      "I know she didn't smell really good a lot of times.\n",
      "I'm a cab driver, and I would pick her up and take her to work.\n",
      "But then I heard that a neighbor went in or saw her or whatever, and she had dead cats.\n",
      "She had, her whole entire apartment was like a, her house, rather, was like a huge kitty litter.\n",
      "And she was publicly humiliated, berated, and charged with a number of different crimes, which I thought was excessive.\n",
      "But, you know, Florida, what are you going to do?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you heard hoarding disorder, what comes to mind is kind of like that woman with-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Worst case kind of thing, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A hundred cats type of thing.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "And from that, the next thing I think of is my mom, who has homes full of clothes that are still in the bags that she bought them in, still with the tags, and she goes shopping every week anyway.\n",
      "Literally, tens of thousands of dollars worth of clothes that are stacked and stacked up, still in the bags.\n",
      "Not only never been worn, never been taken out of the bags since she bought them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the idea of excessive amounts of things, basically.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "And the position on the space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So I-\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "If I had a four bedroom house, I wouldn't have too much stuff.\n",
      "Or maybe I would, I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So I remember you mentioning in the beginning about how sometimes your behavior causes you to be anxious and stressed.\n",
      "Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so you think that you would like to change your behavior because it would make your space more comfortable, less dangerous and you'd feel better ultimately.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And I know that you mentioned before that you'd probably be angry if something were to happen to your jewelry.\n",
      "What about any of your other items?\n",
      "Would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of them?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I would be having to make decisions about things.\n",
      "There's so much stuff to make decisions about.\n",
      "In my bedroom, I know I've bought all these different vitamins and things like that when they were on sale and they're in there someplace.\n",
      "But I can't find it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so it's just more overwhelming than anything, that decision making?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "The decision making about tossing isn't about tossing things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's more so about whether to not to throw out things away that's more distressing.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, that concludes the discussion portion of this interview.\n",
      "The last thing that I'm going to ask is a couple of demographic questions.\n",
      "And, for some reason, if you don't want to answer any of the questions that's totally fine.\n",
      "But it's just simple gender, race-type questions.\n",
      "What's your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Race?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic or Latina?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Your rough household income?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Probably about $90,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your geographic region?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Silicon Valley, northern California.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Master's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "045\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's not working now.\n",
      "Okay, there we go.\n",
      "Okay, so our first question is, so now you know what the study's about and it's related to beliefs and related to having hoarding disorder, our first question is what term would you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "What term would I like you to use for what now?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When we're talking about your difficulties with clutter?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Oh, I don't care, whatever's convenient for you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so just hoarding disorder then is fine?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then the next segment is just going to be demographics, so really basic questions.\n",
      "So the first one is going to be, what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "What was my sex?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And you identify as male or female?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then do you identify as Hispanic or Latino or non-Hispanic?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then what is your highest degree or level of education that you've completed?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "A Master's degree, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then what is your estimated household income and I have ranges of less than $900 ... or sorry, less than $9000, $10,000 to $19,000, $20,000 to $34,000, $35,00 to $49,000, $50,000 to $99,000, and so on?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yeah, it's around that top level.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The $50,000 to $99,000?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yeah, around that, slightly over that maybe.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then which geographic region best describes where you live in the U.S.?\n",
      "I have Northeast, Midwest, South and West.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "West.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So that completes the free listing portion of the interview and the next part is going to be-\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, they can be a little hard to think of everything and frustrating but this next part's going to be easier.\n",
      "So it's basically broken out into different sections and so this first section is going to be talking about behavior and treatment seeking more.\n",
      "My first question is going to be, can you please describe your hoarding and how long it's been going on?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Okay, you have my age there.\n",
      "I'm 73.\n",
      "I would say my hoarding started probably in my 30s or 40s, the really bad hoarding.\n",
      "I didn't have many things growing up really.\n",
      "So there wasn't much hoarding but then as you accumulate in life as you get older.\n",
      "Also, my personal circumstances I think started causing a tendency toward hoarding and I'm just trying to think like, '85, let me just thinking, Yeah, that's about right.\n",
      "Late 30s to early 40s is when it really started being bad, a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, of course.\n",
      "So you mentioned your daughter-in-law and how she felt about it, but have you ever had any other conflicts with people close to you about your collecting, like landlords or other family members or friends?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I own my own house, so I don't have that.\n",
      "I did one time ... I had what I thought was a break in.\n",
      "It actually was a cat that was in my house in the cellar.\n",
      "This was awhile back, and this was when it was a lot worse.\n",
      "I had one room that papers were just all over the floor in no particular order.\n",
      "He came through with a K-9 unit and he asked me, was somebody ransacking that room.\n",
      "I was so embarrassed.\n",
      "I was like, \"No, that was just me.\"\n",
      "So getting his impression of what it looked like was embarrassing to me, so I actually cleaned up that room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So his reaction made you want to clean up a little bit.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I haven't really ...\n",
      "My son has not really said anything.\n",
      "The room where my grandson spends is relatively organized.\n",
      "It's creatively organized because he's a lot like my son and he likes to play with lots of different things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "But he's allergic to dust, so I make sure that room is clean and dust free and stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Dust free.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "The kids don't feel like my house is that out of shape, or they wouldn't let him come over.\n",
      "He spends the night and stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's definitely a livable space.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "Yeah, it's livable.\n",
      "It's just cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I don't have any animals, so there's nothing like ...\n",
      "I've seen books about it, the different levels.\n",
      "I would never put any judgment on those people because I have the same problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "The ones that have animals and they can't take care of ... the animals are pooping in the house and then that adds to the problem.\n",
      "They can't get to it because it's mixed in with their papers and everything else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course, yes.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I think I'm lucky that my son was allergic to cats and I had to actually disown, re home my cat when he was little.\n",
      "My grandson is also asthmatic, so I don't have any animals in the house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I think that helps a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So no animals.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I really didn't.\n",
      "I just got what I need, what I thought that would suffice.\n",
      "And I think I've been trying to eat what I have.\n",
      "I have gotten some takeout here and there and that was only because I was going Coco for Coco pops at home.\n",
      "But no, not really.\n",
      "I just got like I needed toilet paper, so I got toilet paper because I would have been buying toilet paper anyway.\n",
      "I thought maybe more stuff to eat at home than I normally do because I hate, it's hard to cook for one person because you would eat the same thing for three years if you follow one recipe.\n",
      "So I have a tendency to want to eat out and also because my kitchen is stuck, but also for, I know I'm not a good cook.\n",
      "So I don't even like my cooking.\n",
      "So I bought more stuff to be able to eat at home, but not an abundance where I thought well, I have all that stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, not more than usual.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "So it did not affect me that way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Well, that is all the questions.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: And what right now is your sense of kind of the current state of CBT with regards to hoarding disorder?\n",
      "I guess, you know, in laymen’s terms why do you think that it doesn’t work, why do you think that it doesn’t work very well?\n",
      "Interviewee: Because every single hoarder patient that I’ve had has been referred for CBT and usually experts in OCD who understand hoarding and they’ve been trained in some of these models and the patient won’t persist, the patient won’t; it’s not that the treatment itself doesn’t offer something, it’s that the patient won’t do what the therapist tells them to do or they won’t persist at it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Umm and, so there’ve been, so when we’ve had conversations with clinical experts, there’s kind of a divide in terms people who see hoarding as more related to OCD in terms of anxiety regarding discarding possessions versus others who see it as having a relationship to disorders that, like compulsive gambling where they have pleasure associated with acquiring.\n",
      "Umm, for you, where would you see hoarding on kind of like the spectrum between those differences?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well my idea was that hoarding should not have been designated as an independent disorder.\n",
      "I see it as part of OCD.\n",
      "I see it as kind of a sub…essentially as a subtype of OCD because as I said earlier, I can’t think of a hoarding patient I’ve ever seen who did not also have typical OCD behaviors like checking, washing, counting, et cetera.\n",
      "And virtually, well not virtually all, but probably 30-50% of OCD patients I’ve treated have some element of hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: So do you…\n",
      "Interviewee: It’s not a preponderant problem, but they have some tendency.\n",
      "So to me, the overlap is so great that I thought it was a mistake to designate it as an independent disorder because I certainly don’t see it that way.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you see this kind of a pleasure component with acquiring with your hoarding patients or do you kind of find that to be…\n",
      "Interviewee: No, no because most patients say “You know, I really don’t like this, it’s upsetting” so, you know, we try to take the item away from them, we try to get them to throw it away.\n",
      "I mean, you can even just talk threw this with them and they get progressively more anxious or more upset, so their behavior’s no different from what you see with a typical OCD patient.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, well I really appreciate your time…\n",
      "Interviewee: Now, now there is a subgroup of people who hoard who might be said to have compulsive shopping, I’ve read quite a bit about that.\n",
      "And those people do enjoy the shopping, they enjoy buying items, fantasizing about shopping, et cetera.\n",
      "And some of those people sound like hoarders because they buy so much that their house is cluttered with all these items that they have bought to satisfy their compulsive shopping, but to me, that’s kind of a subgroup, separate but slightly overlapping problem.\n",
      "You can compare a compulsive shopper to the person with gambling disorder, certainly because, you know, those are both driven by pleasure.\n",
      "Interviewer: And um, it sounds like in terms of your understanding of hoarding disorder, it’s a combination of either a genetic predisposition or behavioral modeling.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think so.\n",
      "046\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so as you know this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to problems with clutter.\n",
      "Before we start, I would like to ask, when we are talking about your personal difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding items, is there a specific term that you would like to use?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So the first section, thank you for answering all of those questions.\n",
      "The first section that we're going to discuss is all about behavior and treatment-seeking.\n",
      "So can you please describe your problems with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "For me...\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "What do you mean, my problems with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "How I think I'm a hoarder?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So how long you've been dealing with these clutter issues, how they impact your behavior, do you see your behavior as a problem?\n",
      "Is it severe?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Okay, so it started at seven years old.\n",
      "Well, we moved, I'd say 75 times-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "... before I was seven years old.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "There was a lot of issues there.\n",
      "I don't think we stayed in one place...\n",
      "When I was seven years old my dad came back into our lives, and he bought a house, and so things were okay but I was a mini-hoarder.\n",
      "So I just hoarded my desk.\n",
      "And my dad married another woman, and here started the anti-hoarding.\n",
      "She started throwing things out, which started making me hoard more.\n",
      "Then by just sheer transition.\n",
      "I left home very early, and by sheer transition, meaning I couldn't carry a lot on my back, or carry a lot in my own personal moving.\n",
      "But once I settled down I started to collect.\n",
      "In fact, I even bought a bigger house to collect more.\n",
      "It did effect my relationships.\n",
      "I was with a person for many years, and we had many screaming arguments over the saving of many useless things.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:16:08]-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did any of...\n",
      "Oh, sorry.\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did any other friends or family members feel or say a certain thing about this behavior?\n",
      "Or landlord?\n",
      "Participant 46:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Family members...\n",
      "Now at one point I was good at hiding it, so I bought a house that was upstairs/downstairs, and I hoarded everything downstairs so that if I invited a family member upstairs, they would never know about downstairs.\n",
      "But one time something went wrong with downstairs, so I got my older brother to come over, and he was very surprised, because he's an electrician, so...\n",
      "And then finally in these last, what I would say, 10 years, my contractor told me this last time, \"Listen, you've got to get rid of some of your stuff for me to work on this area.\n",
      "I can't work around this anymore.\"\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes. There's a lot of ... I got groceries and I haven't put everything away yet because I can't reach all of the shelves and also that's where I put papers that I'm going to need like whenever we have a restaurant we get a $200 voucher that we can use every month but you can't roll it over to use in the restaurant and since the restaurant is closed, we now get delivered meals if we sign up for it.\n",
      "I keep all my vouchers and stuff on there because sometimes they screw up and you get to take out more than what they should have, they get somebody else's name ...\n",
      "Somebody else gets something using your name, so I have stuff like that.\n",
      "When I get papers, bills I need to pay and stuff, I lay that there so that it's easily accessed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What about any bathtubs or stoves?\n",
      "Are those being used for storage?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I've got things on top of my stove but I don't use my stove.\n",
      "I don't really use the microwave and that's raised up so that's okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Thinking about the items in your home, how important are your things for you to feel at home and of those items, what are the most important to you?\n",
      "I know you've mentioned a lot about these papers and documents that you're holding onto and you're hoping to file them at some point and then the vouchers but are there other things that you find that might be the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Stuff related to my parents, especially my mother.\n",
      "Both of them are deceased now and my mother had Alzheimer's and I would go see her almost every day and my siblings didn't go see her.\n",
      "I would give her gifts and stuff and stuff like that, I ended up taking home with me the night she died.\n",
      "Like a bear that I had given her and a dog and a ceramic dog from Bradford Exchange and pictures, videos I had made of her before and I would show her when I would be visiting and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm really sorry to hear that.\n",
      "You would say the items related to your mom and your father are probably the most important to you.\n",
      "Do you feel that you spend a lot of time with these items?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I don't necessarily look at them every day but right now my bear, [inaudible 00:23:54] and I have that sitting in my window and then I have a spotlight that I turn on at night because in the town I live in they have what's called their Teddy Bear Hunt and it's people going out with their small kids and looking in windows to find teddy bears.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I've seen that.\n",
      "That's so cute.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sounds good.\n",
      "And um that concludes the end, but is there anything I missed?\n",
      "Anything important that you feel like I haven’t asked about that you would like to see explained in the videos or anything I missed within the interview?\n",
      "Speaker: Um, you know you as students, as PhD students, you know I think, my wife has lots of PhD students in her lab and what I see with them is that they wind up staying more educational because they’re students.\n",
      "You know but if you can break away from that, you know what you like and what you don’t like.\n",
      "But then again you know what you might like for his project and that’s different, but you have good taste, you dress well your posture’s well.\n",
      "You know what looks good and what doesn’t look good.\n",
      "What you’d be interested in and what doesn’t.\n",
      "Same with me, basically I like the same thing you like.\n",
      "You know we’re on a level you know unless you haven’t been around the world and have been kept I the closet, you know.\n",
      "Once seeing the boring, you know the commercials that challenge, and they always try to make them better, but how do you make a McDonald’s commercial better?\n",
      "Interviewer: So if you have any other suggestions or feedback.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Always make someone think.\n",
      "For instance, I told you the commercial that I did.\n",
      "Now the film was from the back of the girl and she’s coming out of the water, shivering, you know, but you don’t know if she’s crying, or laughing, or giggling.\n",
      "Now the intrigue of it is what’s so nice.\n",
      "But when they came from the front you can see that she’s enjoying herself.\n",
      "Interviewer: So the visuals need to be… what you think.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah you take it; you can take it to places, you know, be creative.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Sounds good.\n",
      "Speaker: You know like in dance class when things got boring they would say “show me how it feels if you stuck that finger right in that socket, right now.\n",
      "Show me how it feels.”\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "It wouldn’t be boring in any way.\n",
      "It’d be shocking, it’d be devastating, but it wouldn’t be boring.\n",
      "Interviewer: So no boring.\n",
      "Being creative not boring is what I’m hearing from you.\n",
      "Speaker: You don’t want to do that.\n",
      "You lose people.\n",
      "Like do it again or did you really stick that finger in that socket.\n",
      "You know he’s a good actor!\n",
      "Something like that.\n",
      "But you see that’s not, you’re not in commercial video arts.\n",
      "So I’m off in lala land.\n",
      "But I’m just telling you what works.\n",
      "And that’s only because I did commercials and I found out what commercials worked and what commercials didn’t work and why, and those creative people; they’re geniuses in a way, but they’re also, they stay in a box.\n",
      "A lot of the geniuses are making money and they do; they know how to do things but they still stay in the box.\n",
      "Sometimes you have to reach out of the box.\n",
      "What’s amazing about this is that I’d do it again and how many things do you want to do again medically?\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Not many.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Interviewer: Well, I’m glad you had a good experience here.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes it was better than good, it was exciting because it was results that I would enjoy and my son’s gonna enjoy.\n",
      "So, it’s like you said it’s a feeling but it’s not just good it’s like you guys gave us a gift.\n",
      "I don’t know I sound like I’m going on and on about.\n",
      "I mean I’m trying to communicate with you and tell you how this was so, this was so close to home.\n",
      "I mean with going and taking so many tests and seeing so many doctors.\n",
      "Just to get diagnosed, we went to twelve different doctors you know and everyone’s got a different opinion and everyone’s got a way of doing things.\n",
      "But this is a result here.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Less cluttered, you can see the floor.\n",
      "Ten years ago, nine years ago, nine or ten years ago, it was clean then because we used to have a great big Easter egg hunt every year.\n",
      "And I stopped then when my arthritis got too bad.\n",
      "And I had to have it clean then, and I had to have the yard clean then.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, basically you'd just like a more open area where you're able to walk around easier, where the floor is clear of things and you'd be able to have maybe people over.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That'd be cleaner but yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so cleaner and more clutter-free is what I'm hearing.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, when you think about your possessions, I know you mention there are things like the piano and the mantle and the mirror, those have been in the house for 150 years, so you would consider them valuable because they're family possessions.\n",
      "What other things would you determine how your objects are valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I think my grandmother lived to be 100 in this house and it was bare.\n",
      "And I'm like, \"Well, why doesn't she have any stuff in here?\" Now I realize it's simplified.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, you would say really the way to determine an object is valuable or not is how far back it goes maybe in the family or if it's family-related?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "In my bedroom I've got a big old oak dresser that I bought for $15 when we first got married, so I keep that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "So, maybe also something that is very useful but was also a good deal.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thinking about the items in your house, what would you say is the most precious item?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I've got some jewelry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And is that precious or valuable to you monetarily or are they family-related?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "They're my first.\n",
      "I do have some older stuff more valuable as the newer stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what do you think would happen if you lost your jewelry?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I'd be angry, but I don't use it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I know you mentioned prior that you feel like some of your things just need to be distributed.\n",
      "Do you think you have too much stuff and how do you decide when things are too much?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yup, I have too much stuff.\n",
      "Because there's piles of it everywhere and there's a lot of things that I need to send back that I ordered online.\n",
      "But that takes time and organization to do that.\n",
      "And that's not happening very well.\n",
      "Every now and then I get a few boxes sent off.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, when things start piling up, it's getting hard to move around or you have things that you're not using, that's when you decide, okay, I think I have too much.\n",
      "And so, she just has the perfect attitude.\n",
      "She's not saying, \"What about this?\n",
      "What about this?\n",
      "What about this?\" I couldn't handle it, like instant decisions.\n",
      "If I have to put something aside, we put it aside.\n",
      "But she's just so gentle about that.\n",
      "I don't feel judged in any way by her.\n",
      "And I don't know how you could walk in this house and not judge it.\n",
      "So at some level, she must think, \"God, how does she live here?\" But she never lets that show.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's very interesting, because I just know, from the few things I've heard and read and stuff on this research, was just that it's often very hard.\n",
      "Not many people with this person can trust someone to come in and work with their stuff.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I would never be able to ...\n",
      "My shrink actually has a woman and her helper, so I guess they have their own little company.\n",
      "And they come in and throw out all sorts of stuff.\n",
      "And they get rid of the things.\n",
      "I would not be able to have her people do that.\n",
      "They just say, \"You don't need this.\n",
      "This is ridiculous.\"\n",
      "And I'm not ready to have it handled that way.\n",
      "NAME might say, \"Well, are you sure you need it?\" That's the strongest she would get.\n",
      "She would likely not question that, unless ... because I think, maybe, because I'm ready to get rid of a lot when we're working together, too.\n",
      "I mean, that may be part of it, but I don't just say, \"Clean this closet out.\n",
      "Just empty it.\n",
      "Get rid of everything in it.\"\n",
      "That's what my shrink's service does.\n",
      "They just get rid of everything in the closet.\n",
      "And it's like, \"No, I want to know at least what's there, why I put it there to begin with.\"\n",
      "And so, I would have trouble with like, a crew that came in to clean it up?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They claim if it looks like it's good enough to take to a thrift store, they'll take it to a thrift store.\n",
      "But I don't want everything that looks good enough to go to a thrift store to go.\n",
      "I want some of those things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, that's all the questions that I have for you.\n",
      "Hold on a second.\n",
      "I'm just going to stop the recording.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer 2: You are volunteering to participate in a research project conducted by [NAME 6:22] from [INSTITUTION 6:23].\n",
      "The aim of this study is to better understand the ways that researchers and clinicians think about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "You’ll be one of approximately 30 people being interviewed for this research and your participation is fully voluntary.\n",
      "You won’t be paid and you can withdraw or discontinue at any time without any penalty.\n",
      "If you decline to participate or if you decide to withdraw from the study no one will be told.\n",
      "Most interviewees we hope will find the discussion interesting and thought-provoking.\n",
      "If you feel uncomfortable in any way during the interview session, however, you obviously have the right to answer any question or to end the interview at any time.\n",
      "Participation in this study involves being interviewed by researchers from [INSTITUTION 7:01].\n",
      "Our interview will last approximately 60 minutes, and we’re going to take notes during the interview.\n",
      "We’re also audio recording our interview and we’re going to transcribe the subsequent dialogue.\n",
      "If you don’t want to be taped unfortunately you won’t be able to participate in the study.\n",
      "We the researchers won’t identify you by name in any report using any information obtained from this interview, and your confidentiality as a participant in the study will remain secure.\n",
      "Subsequent usage of records of data will be subject to standard data use policies which will protect the anonymity of individuals and institutions.\n",
      "Faculty and administrators from my campus will neither be present at the interview, nor will have access to raw notes or transcripts.\n",
      "This precaution will prevent your comments from having any negative repercussions.\n",
      "And, this research study has been reviewed and approved by the IRB at [INSTITUTION 7:48].\n",
      "I have contact info for both [NAME 7:54] and for the Institution Review Board if you’d like it.\n",
      "Do you have any questions or would you like to continue with the interview?\n",
      "Interviewee: I have no questions, and I am consenting to continue.\n",
      "048\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So as you know, this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question that I want to ask you is what term do you prefer me referencing when we discuss your difficulties with clutter and difficulties with discarding?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I recognize it as a cognitive impairment.\n",
      "How about high stimulation environment?\n",
      "That's [inaudible 00:00:38].\n",
      "High stimulation environment, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So yeah, okay, sounds good.\n",
      "High stimulation environment.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Like the least loaded term that I've been able to contrive.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So since we're kind of naturally moving into the discussion portion of this interview, I'm going to go ahead and transition there.\n",
      "So I know previously when we were making some lists, you mentioned that you experienced a traumatic brain injury.\n",
      "Can you please describe your issues with high stimulation environment, and how long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Before I was seven years old, I'd had five severe head injuries.\n",
      "I've had a dozen concussions, two grand mal seizures, subdural hematoma, and I broke my neck once.\n",
      "All my life, up until the last 20 years or so, I've spent my time recovering from the most recent severe traumatic brain injury.\n",
      "When I was two, I flew out of a car going about 35 miles an hour.\n",
      "A few months later, I climbed to the top of a trellis in front of the house and leaned back and 15 feet, landed on my head.\n",
      "I repeatedly awakened in the hospital after more than a half hour unconsciousness.\n",
      "My record so far is five days.\n",
      "That was after the two grand mal seizures and the subdural hematoma from an auto accident when I was 17.\n",
      "I've slipped and landed on my head.\n",
      "I've had my, wrecks, you know, car accident, motorcycle accident.\n",
      "I try to pass it off as saying I'm born with a big head and an active childhood, and I never realized that it was particularly strange or notable, because that was my experience.\n",
      "Looking at it objectively now, I see that throughout that time, I sort of used a lot more focus and attention that I received.\n",
      "We moved around every three years or so, and I did well in school, so everything else, my comorbidity of ADD, which is a common comorbidity of TBIs, caused a lot of problems for me, but they were looked at as discipline issues rather than clinical, and I was punished all the time.\n",
      "I was always in trouble.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "I can imagine how traumatic all that has been.\n",
      "So how long has, kind of go a little more into detail about your issues with the high stimulation environment, and has this been going on since you were a child with your injuries?\n",
      "Go a little more into detail about that.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: We’re just trying to get the things that are on the top, you know, the top of your mind when the prompt is read.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Ok, so now we’ll move more into the free form interview section where we’ll have a little bit more of a conversation.\n",
      "We’re just going to ask you some questions about how you think about this, kind of, clinical picture in your practice and in your work.\n",
      "And just so to give us some background about you, could you just start out by telling us your background related to this disorder and how you kind of got involved with this?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure.\n",
      "So, I started working with hoarding in 2006.\n",
      "So, the practice where I had been working at, which was the [INSTITUTION 21:17], [NAME 20:20] was on staff there and she had been setting up the hoarding program, and when she was leaving the staff to go work elsewhere they were looking to bring somebody else on to work with hoarding.\n",
      "And, I already had a strong background in working with OCD and with a CBT background, so they said, “If you’re interested we’ll bring you on, and we’ll kind of start orienting you at that point.”\n",
      "So, that was the first formal work with hoarding disorder at that point, and previous to that I always joke that I enjoy organizing, the container store is one of my favorite places, I have multiple label makers.\n",
      "So, I already kind of had the mindset of, “how do you deal with stuff,” and then it just kind of got moved into a hoarding situation through getting introduced to it by [NAME 22:18].\n",
      "Interviewer 2: What is your training and educational background?\n",
      "Interviewee: So, my undergraduate is psychology from [INSTITUTION 22:29], and then I did my Master’s and my PhD in clinical psych at [INSTITUTION 22:36].\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok, and do you now see patient’s clinically with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, yeah.\n",
      "So, I do private practice working with hoarding and OCD spectrum, anxiety, and depression.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm, and do you also conduct research or is your role mostly clinical?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, it’s all clinical.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "And, you said how long has it been since you started working in hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: 2006.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "[NAME 23:08], do you want to take over with the next couple questions?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "So, the first question that we have for you in this section now is, “What for you are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, like collecting for example, and hoarding disorder?”\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s the… I’m trying to… I would put it where there is the detachment of importance to the item.\n",
      "Kind of, the difficulty making the decision and trying to prioritize what items are more important, less important.\n",
      "So, tending to apply greater importance across the board, and I think that just ties in with the impaired decision-making process.\n",
      "So, I feel as though a lot of the emotional attachment is not necessarily that different, but I think it is more intense.\n",
      "So, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: More intense and more, I guess, dispersed.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so a broader blanket, and more intense emotions and a greater value attached.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think one of the statistics was like 60 or 70% of American women identify as being, you know, shopping addicts.\n",
      "But, I don’t know how that term would really be operationalized.\n",
      "So, is it more just linguistically thrown around similar to, like if someone said, “Oh my gosh I’m so OCD.”\n",
      "Well, are you really, or is it diagnostic criteria of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?\n",
      "You know, how is shopping addiction compared to the actual excessive acquisition and the emotional piece that’s tied into it?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok, so maybe there’s excessive consumption that isn’t a shopping addiction.\n",
      "People might perceive it as obsessive, but that shopping addiction or that, you know, excessive accumulation of items through hoarding, that’s kind of separate from that but perhaps related as well.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think so, and then also looking at the excessive acquisition from the hoarding side of things, that is not actual shopping.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm, great.\n",
      "Interviewee: And how is… and does that serve the same emotional purpose of shopping addiction or is it functionally different?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: I see.\n",
      "Ok, that makes a lot of sense.\n",
      "It’s a good question, and it’s a good distinction to make kind of between those different levels of acquisition and different, kind of, reasons that people might do it and problems discarding versus purchasing.\n",
      "[NAME 73:39] do you want to ask this kind of next set of questions?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: This is our kind of last group of questions for you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, this is our last series.\n",
      "So, we’re kind of curious about the typical process that occurs to get patients into your office for treatment or for study participation, and so we talked about in the free listing, you know, the reasons why a person might seek treatment and, you know, experiencing distress or situational crisis or family urging were some of the things that you mentioned.\n",
      "So, do you feel like people presenting for treatment are normally self-motivated or more often by others?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s more often by others, at least for maybe the initial appointment and then it transitions over to them more wanting to do it for themselves.\n",
      "Kind of as they start to maybe better understand what the process would be and they’re realizing that it’s something for them as opposed to something that is against them or them being blamed and chastised.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: It’s more constructive for them.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok, and how long has the hoarding behavior typically been going on before you’ll see patients?\n",
      "Interviewee: Decades.\n",
      "Yeah, I’m thinking… A lot of my clients, they’ve been hoarding for probably maybe 25, 30 years.\n",
      "And, that’s maybe towards the low end because I’ve got clients coming in in their sixties.\n",
      "It’s been going on in some form or another probably since, easily their thirties if not their twenties.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Because this house was completely filled, every crook and cranny, and then I moved 1500 square feet of my jammed in crammed possessions into this house on top of that.\n",
      "There wasn't one empty cupboard.\n",
      "There wasn't one empty closet.\n",
      "There wasn't one empty anything.\n",
      "So it was just came in box after box and then furniture and all these sofas and all these chairs.\n",
      "I mean, I've gotten rid of a little bit of stuff.\n",
      "I've worked hard at it.\n",
      "It's hard to get rid of stuff.\n",
      "Nobody wants it.\n",
      "I think I could get rid of this if I could find anybody that wanted stuff.\n",
      "I'd be slow at it but I would do it.\n",
      "But nobody, but nobody wants anything.\n",
      "This is now not anything most people value.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so would you say that there are parts of your house maybe like the kitchen or bathrooms that you aren't able to access and that just are storage areas right now?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "They're like storage areas but I'm very skilled at accessing things in storage areas.\n",
      "I keep little narrow pathways and I can tiptoe over things that other people would find absolutely impossible to get everyday items.\n",
      "I know to make it work for me but I have to stay very flexible and fit and agile in order to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so would you say that maybe your floor is entirely covered with either stacks of boxes or papers or are there parts of the floor that are actually clear that you can see?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, I have my exercise space, which is clear.\n",
      "And even the other parts, I would say each room has maybe 20%, 30% of floor space, not every room, it varies.\n",
      "I would say the very least is 15, 20% and some are a little more.\n",
      "But, no, it's like a storage locker in each room.\n",
      "I'm sorry to say and sometimes, every once in a while someone will come and need to stay here and then I'll get one bedroom cleared out and one bathroom cleared out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So what would you-\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "But then it regresses and then it reverts back, alarmingly quickly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "And then the worst indicator of my mental condition is how much stuff is in the bed I sleep in.\n",
      "If I'm feeling really insecure there are tons of books and papers and things in the bed, all night long.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you live alone then?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So what would you like your home to look like then?\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you give any kind of credence to the idea that being the response to trauma or as some patients might say the need to save because of poverty or anything like that?\n",
      "Interviewee: The trauma explanation, no. The other explanation, I…that you mentioned saving because they grew up poor or something, to me that’s environmental, so there’s always an environmental component to that.\n",
      "That could be part of why someone behaves this way.\n",
      "But most people exposed to poverty and, you know, who don’t have much growing up they don’t behave this way, so there’s obviously something different about the person who develops hoarding from that background.\n",
      "And to me, that’s probably a genetic component that predisposes them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Have you ever encountered a child who you would characterize as a hoarder or a person under the age of eighteen?\n",
      "Interviewee: I can’t think of any but I’m not a child psychiatrist.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Well, I really appreciate your time today and helping me think through these issues and participating in this study.\n",
      "To let you know what the next steps will be as I mentioned: we’re transcribing these interviews and the team is conducting interviews for the next I think two months with the clinical experts, and we’re hoping to be able to report our findings and to report on kind of the general state of knowledge of this field shortly.\n",
      "And then the second phase of the project, we’re going to be interviewing people with this disorder to see how their views align to try to understand how that might affect their adherence to treatment and their desire to seek treatment.\n",
      "Um so I really appreciate your time today.\n",
      "Do you have any questions for me about what we’re doing or anything I can answer?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, not at all.\n",
      "Interviewer: I really appreciate your patience; I apologize for uh…\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Yeah, you’re welcome.\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you very much.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Bye now.\n",
      "Interviewer: Bye.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, and what about employees of institutions of the state: social workers, homeowner’s associations, police officers?\n",
      "Do you feel like you see a fair amount of that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Not so much.\n",
      "And, I’ve gotten a couple of calls say from a hospital looking to create a discharge plan.\n",
      "One of the issues that came up during the course of treatment while they were hospitalized is recognition of there being a hoarding situation, “What can we do to connect with services?” There have been some times, and maybe it’s just not happening as much now, when I was working in [INSTITUTION 81:23] there was a [INSTITUTION 81:26] hoarding past course in place for a couple of years.\n",
      "And so, during that time and then for a couple of years following that if there was a call to the county they would often channel it towards me before trying to connect with resources.\n",
      "I haven’t worked in [INSTITUTION 81:46] for almost 4 years now, so that might be why I’m not getting those same calls.\n",
      "And, the county that I’m in now, [INSTITUTION 81:57], it seems like… Well, at one point someone told me that there is no hoarding in [LOCATION 82:03], which I find very hard to believe, but I think that the resources… I’m not sure why I’m not getting calls in the same way, because I’m sure that there are cases.\n",
      "I don’t think their support system, county based, is really any different or more extensive than [LOCATION 82:25].\n",
      "They might just be referring elsewhere.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: [INAUDIBLE 82:33] kind of thing?\n",
      "Or, do think that they perceive that it’s not the kind of place that hoarding disorder occurs?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that there is a growing awareness of it, but maybe there….\n",
      "It’s a smaller county, so they might be able to feel they can handle some of the interventions more in house.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: I’m not sure.\n",
      "Or, it may just be that these individuals are… they’re maybe getting support, they’re already engaged with a therapist.\n",
      "You know, that might be kind of how if there’s some agency that becomes aware of their big hoarding situation, “Oh well you’re already seeing a therapist, you’re already doing this, so we’re not going to refer out.”\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "So, just to kind of wrap up our interview, we really appreciate you going so long through this with us.\n",
      "It’s been a really great interview and it’s been a pleasure learning from you so we really appreciate you taking the time to go through really in detail with us.\n",
      "Interviewee: Happy to do it!\n",
      "Interviewer 2: So, yeah, no it’s very, very valuable for us.\n",
      "Your experiences are really interesting, so the final kind of question that we have for you to close out our interview is to have you go through what you think the biggest things we still don’t know about hoarding disorder are or the unanswered questions in your mind for the future.\n",
      "Interviewee: Hm.\n",
      "I have no idea.\n",
      "One question that came up in the training that I did today would be, and I haven’t looked into this at all, is there any exploration of CBT in working with hoarding clients to deal with the intense emotional issues that can come up in relation to their items?\n",
      "And, it kind of seems like it would make sense that that would work, but I don’t know if that’s really been explored at all.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: That’s interesting, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "And it was just an expensive thing to have, even though I honestly think that someone like myself could get or should be able to get an animal as a support thing because of the fact that when you're totally by yourself, it's nice to have somebody to at least or feel like there's somebody in your house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "I totally understand that.\n",
      "When you think about your apartment, what would you like it to look like?\n",
      "What would your ideal home or apartment looked like?\n",
      "Would there still be stuff in it?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Say that again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would your stuff still be in it only more organized?\n",
      "What would it look like?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "It would totally be different.\n",
      "It would be more probably minimalistic in a sense.\n",
      "I like a lot of the cottage stuff, so it'd have a little bit of a plan of collection type thing.\n",
      "But just every place with things would not be here that did not have a place.\n",
      "And then I think that it would be tidier because sometimes I was trying to explain to my counselor that there are certain things from my childhood or my past that it's hard to throw away because it's sort of like if you did, no one would know you existed.\n",
      "Although if you were to pass away, there's this great book called the Art of Swedish Death Cleaning where basically you clean up everything so your family doesn't have to.\n",
      "So even if I kept it, when they came into the apartment, it would still end up in a big garbage bag anyway.\n",
      "So it's that emotional like but if I don't have any children there's really nothing to bookmark me into this world anyway.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "So it would look like a minimalistic cottage type thing.\n",
      "I wouldn't have gone with the dark furniture.\n",
      "I like things a lot lighter.\n",
      "I probably would have found an apartment with a lot more natural light, because it's very dark in here.\n",
      "And one of the things that I think I am deeply affected by is during the winter when it gets dark it's even harder for me to try to even begin to tackle anything.\n",
      "All I want to do is come home and hibernate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I understand how much it can affect your mood.\n",
      "So it sounds like your space would be quite different, ideally you would like it to be minimalist.\n",
      "You'd like it to still have like a kind of sense of a person having a sense of taste and a collection, but mostly empty and kind of light and airy and lots of space.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah, because I would like to go back to entertainment.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "So do you feel like the items that you hang on to, the items in your home, do they contribute to making you feel at home in your space?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Not an argument, per se, no. And then she was very grateful to me because not this Christmas but the prior Christmas I had my sister and her partner plus the neighbors, couple and then my nephew and my sister's son and we ... she does all the holidays by herself and rightfully so and I managed to do a meal.\n",
      "It wasn't done well but it got done and they were so grateful that I had done it that nobody complained about anything.\n",
      "So if you set a low enough standard people are so impressed (laughs)\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "I mean, I'm glad that you were able to enjoy that meal though.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Something that everybody else would be scornful about they were just laudatory about.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "If they can get in the front door they're amazed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That just leads me to my last section which is distinguishing hoarding disorder.\n",
      "We talked about it a little bit before but what would you say are the most important differences between what's considered normal saving behavior, such as like having a collection of something, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "The big difference is other people do not feel pain when they throw something away.\n",
      "They are disciplined about putting things away.\n",
      "If there isn't room for something then they throw something out.\n",
      "If something new comes in and there's not room then ... or in fact if something new comes in usually they have a rule that something has to go out.\n",
      "They don't let people dump things on them as much.\n",
      "They feel much more comfortable about saying, \"No, thank you.\n",
      "I don't want that.\"\n",
      "They're good at that.\n",
      "They're better at boundaries I would say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "In general.\n",
      "They practice behaviors that make for a better home environment and typically a lot of my friends, most of my friends don't live alone so they have to keep up standards for the other person too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So living with someone is a big way to, I guess stop that behavior.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "And I think, in general, opposites attract in that sense.\n",
      "There's one person that keeps the one that might collect stuff, it keeps a lid on it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Really, it gets in the way of others sitting down or when you really need to find something, it might be underneath things?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you describe a specific time where your difficulties with clutter got in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There's been times that I've looked all over papers.\n",
      "Like I had something with my taxes and I couldn't find it and then found it maybe two months later.\n",
      "Or something that I saw on TV that I wanted to have and I knew that I had gotten it but I couldn't find it and then I thought maybe I didn't take it with me when I moved so I bought it again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It really gets in the way when you're trying to look for something that you need.\n",
      "That's when it becomes frustrating?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know you've mentioned that you had the professional organizer come so that, to me, kind of says that you'd like to change this behavior.\n",
      "Is that true?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is that because you feel embarrassed and you want to have people over without worrying?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think that it would be somewhat freeing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Freeing?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "We talked about prior that you would be upset at first if you had to get rid of the bear that you gave your mom.\n",
      "Would you be upset if you had to get rid of any of your other items?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "No, there's things that when I'm going through things that I'll find and I'll think, \"I don't need this anymore\" or, \"This is broken so get rid of it\" or, \"I can't find the cord to this so what's the point?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You would just save things that you really feel that you have an emotional connection with?\n",
      "It may be difficult but the things that you can reason, \"Okay, these aren't useful\" then it doesn't upset you to get rid of them?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, that pretty much concludes our discussion portion of the interview.\n",
      "I am just going to ask you a couple demographic questions.\n",
      "If at any time, you don't want to answer, there's no problem at all.\n",
      "What is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Race?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic or Latina?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Household income?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "If I feel like it doesn't fit my needs or future needs or it's broken.\n",
      "That's one thing that the class taught me, or the group thing taught me.\n",
      "Was sometimes I would hold on to things that we'll all get this fixed, or this is really valuable.\n",
      "It just needs to be fixed.\n",
      "I would see potential on things.\n",
      "And so the group has helped me, if it's broken or I haven't fixed it in the last week or year that I'm still not going to fix it.\n",
      "So I definitely would throw it away.\n",
      "One thing I didn't have that some of in the discussion was once it's in the trash, I am not jumping in the dumpster, in the bag to go get it out because all of a sudden I changed my mind.\n",
      "It's in the bag, it's gone.\n",
      "Soit's hard.\n",
      "It's not like useful.\n",
      "If it is broken, it goes in the trash.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you don't have the problem of, once you decided that something is going to be discarded, yeah it's gone?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "It's gone.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And it sounds like if something's broken, you've kind of made peace with the fact that you're probably not going to fix it.\n",
      "And so it's gone?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "That's one of the things I learned from the group that I was struggling with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And it sounds like the biggest thing that will stop you from discarding is this feeling that it's still valuable to you, that you could still use it in the future.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'll buy things off these and like I found these great golden silver pen, and I had been looking for this Christmas to do the Christmas part, which once again I did not get sent out again.\n",
      "But anyway, in hopes that I would get to it as well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So for instance acquire things because you want to be able to do Christmas cards.\n",
      "So you'll hang onto something if you think that you're going to be able to do it in the future?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And it's something that is reasonable.\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "If I found a space suit on sale, I wouldn't sit there and go, \"Oh, okay, well, I'll get that and then maybe one day when they send people to Mars, I will have it.\"\n",
      "It has to be something really reasonable or practical.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's all stuff that is possible for you to use?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And even if you haven't used it, even if it's been sitting around since the day you bought it and it's still kind of right in front of you, as long as it's still possible for you to use it, you'll continue to hang onto it?\n",
      "You've got things from the 70s with things from the 90s and things from a week ago.\n",
      "And then it gets more and more muddled and more and more confused and then I challenge these people to know what's in these piles after 60 years of mixing up the piles.\n",
      "I'm just more professional at messing it up.\n",
      "To use a distortion of the word professional.\n",
      "I'm more effective at it, no that's not the right word either, anyway.\n",
      "More deranged.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, I wouldn't say deranged but you just ... it gets mixed up and then so you don't know what's in your piles anymore.\n",
      "Did it ever cause problems between you and any coworkers?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, to some degree but I had a situation where I could limit that.\n",
      "I've always been a person that's worked pretty independently and I don't know how to work collaboratively very well.\n",
      "The way people work in today's world, I started in a job that was like that.\n",
      "I did educational R&D but then I got out of that and I was ... and even there you could work awfully independently but in today's world everything is collaborative and so I would need a whole new set of skills to be able to do that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's true a lot of it is group work and group thinking.\n",
      "That's a big part of a lot of jobs today.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And it's the only way to work really, it's much more effective.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It can be a lot more effective.\n",
      "There are going to be problems but in general it has a lot of good outcomes.\n",
      "So you mentioned that you liked working alone, has that ever impacted your romantic relationships then?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I mean, I have a closed door policy here and that's not good (laughs).\n",
      "I have never married.\n",
      "I was an only child for a long time and then shortly after my sister was born I went away to college.\n",
      "And then in college I enjoyed group living actually in college but then I had some roommates in graduate school and stuff and then I started living alone again and I've lived alone all my life after that.\n",
      "So, certainly by the time I was 40 I was completely living alone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'm just trying to look over all my questions I have set up and see if we missed anything along the way but I think we've covered everything.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "So, Interviewer, tell me, you're a graduate student at the University of Florida?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, I'm actually an undergrad.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "And your field is psychology?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, actually it's anthropology.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Ah, I was an anthro undergrad.\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh really?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Interesting.\n",
      "So-\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "But I think it might have been when I was on my own, starting to be on my own, and I just felt like it was comforting to have possessions of mine that I kept with me to kind of remember things in the past.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you would say that ...\n",
      "So what I'm hearing is that these things comfort you and that your father was also a collector.\n",
      "Do you think this definitely influenced you starting to collect things?\n",
      "I know you said you'd collected coins.\n",
      "Would you say there could be a possible hereditary component, or you just like to collect?\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "I don't feel like either of my parents ...\n",
      "My mom especially, I think she was the one that sort of governed what stayed in the house.\n",
      "My dad saved baseball cards and coins and stamps, but they weren't outrageous collections.\n",
      "They didn't take up a whole room or anything like that, or get in the way of anything.\n",
      "They were just, to me, very interesting and it was an interesting hobby.\n",
      "It was something I associated with my dad.\n",
      "My mom didn't have that.\n",
      "She was really poor, so she didn't even have anything to her name.\n",
      "So she was more live in the moment, but she planned for the future.\n",
      "So she was probably the more healthy of the two of them that way, but she was the one that always said get rid of stuff as you go and just get rid of clutter.\n",
      "She's very organized.\n",
      "I always felt kind of bad whenever she'd see all my collections.\n",
      "She hasn't been to my house.\n",
      "She passed away this last year, but she hadn't been to my house in a while.\n",
      "She was like, \"Jude,\" and she'd shake her head.\n",
      "I saved toys too.\n",
      "My son, she's 40.\n",
      "He's going to be 40 this year.\n",
      "I saved a lot of his toys.\n",
      "I actually have some of my own toys still, like Barbie dolls and dolls I had.\n",
      "I have a grandson and he plays with the legos that my son had.\n",
      "So I have a hard time getting rid of toys.\n",
      "I have an entire room filled with toys, and he's six.\n",
      "I'm thinking that, after he's older, I am going to have to get rid of those toys, and that's going to be hard because I felt like my son, I didn't really ...\n",
      "Being a single working mom, I didn't really get to spend as much quality time with him and I'm kind of doing it with my grandson.\n",
      "He's the only grandson, so he's pretty spoiled by all of us.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 47:\n",
      "So I have trouble with that.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I guess what you're interested in appears in this world.\n",
      "It seems to be a lot of it around and then the material isn't different so you can go back to these books and just keep reviewing and keep going over the techniques.\n",
      "I probably should start each day with that, which is an interesting idea.\n",
      "It just came to me that I would review this kind of thing and then just try to enact one of these tools or one of these techniques right away instead of being theoretical which is I have a hard time moving from theoretical to action.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that can often be quite difficult.\n",
      "So that just made me think of something, has your problem ever impacted your work life?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I think it definitley did.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "In what ways would you say it impacted?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, a completely disorganized desk and not being able to find notes about what I needed to be doing and then just the inefficiency ...We haven't talked about this.\n",
      "The huge inefficiencies of not being able to find something and the amount of time and this is a very common thing, amount of time wasted just looking for X that you need.\n",
      "If you'd done it immediately ... that's why I do the bills immediately when they come in because then you're not wasting any time looking for that bill and it does wonders for your credit rating because you are the world's fastest bill payer.\n",
      "The minute it arrives I pay my bills.\n",
      "But like a lot of people who have these problems you can waste so much time searching for something you need.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's very interesting because I know often people will say everything looks very messy but they know exactly what's in each pile and you're very honest, you're like, \"I don't know what's in this pile.\n",
      "I'm going to have to search for it.\"\n",
      "I think that's very interesting.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, when I was working I was better at knowing what was in the piles because I just simply had to know and it couldn't get quite so out of hand but once it gets totally out of hand and then the other problem is ... this is huge, people come, so you swoop everything up and mix everything up and put it in a box, get it hauled out of the public's face or the place where the person's going to be permitted to come and then it gets more and more confused.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Sometimes.\n",
      "I mean, I don't have cable, so it's not on anything, but sometimes it's a little bit harsh to watch something that hit so close.\n",
      "But sometimes I find it interesting because if I watch, I'm watching to listen to the person that's coming into their home to help them.\n",
      "If you notice all the people that are able to conquer it through their help, they're able to pull out everything and then put things back.\n",
      "That's sort of hard in an everyday thing where you can have somebody with a dumpster come to your house and you pull out everything.\n",
      "Because just the thought of doing that feels like exposure.\n",
      "If I lived in my own home and I had a backyard, heck yeah, I would do it.\n",
      "But living in an apartment, I'm still sort of scared in order to accomplish that.\n",
      "But if I do watch it, I'm watching it to feed what the counselor's telling them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes total sense.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So you use it kind of as a source of advice, but at the same time, it's frustrating because you'd love somebody to come in and just say \"Okay, we're doing this and getting rid of all your stuff.\"\n",
      "Because that is exactly what it sounds like you'd like to do.\n",
      "But also because you don't have the privacy for that.\n",
      "You worry that would also be kind of like all of your neighbors would be seeing you do that if you were to do it, so.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But it's not so much the part of wanting to be able to do it.\n",
      "I mean, have someone do it for you because of the fact that I've had friends, that volunteer that say they will come on over but it's very stressful to have somebody at your house and then they're so afraid to throw away anything.\n",
      "Or how should I say it?\n",
      "They have to ask you for about every piece of something.\n",
      "So it's more stressful for me.\n",
      "And it takes up more of my time because one time my sister-in-law came over and so we decided we're going to try to do the kitchen.\n",
      "For every five seconds she was asking me about something and to try to push her onto one section and say, \"If you could just do this,\" it was very difficult because it was always requiring me to refer back to me.\n",
      "So I couldn't get her working on something while I was working on something else.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "She can't make the decisions for you.\n",
      "So she ends up asking you and that ends up taking twice as much time because you're having to tell her what to do.\n",
      "Interviewer: So with that being said, just more follow up on that question, should there be any non- human characters, such as animals, superheroes?\n",
      "Speaker: Uh… it’s interesting you say superheroes.\n",
      "My brother- in- law is a big super hero guy here in town.\n",
      "He supplies Shands with the bat- mobile, all that kind of stuff… that really would be, in my opinion, dependent on the kid.\n",
      "Depending on the age of the kid and their interest level, you may have kids that are just like my brother in law, who are big time into the superhero genre: Marvel, DC comics and all that kind of stuff, and you can get kids that are really into that world, because they’ve decided to become, I hate to say reclusive, but inward, looking inward constantly, and not really looking out.\n",
      "Introvert, is what I was looking for.\n",
      "So they start looking at nonstop computer games, videos online, things like that becomes a world that they are familiar with.\n",
      "So I would say on a limited basis, you may be able to, depends on your budget!\n",
      "How many videos can you put out?\n",
      "Interviewer: What about children?\n",
      "Should we include a boy or girl?\n",
      "Both?\n",
      "Or parents, friends, doctors in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Well, I mean, you’re trying to make the parent feel comfortable in most cases, because the kid’s not going to have a choice, they’re going to be coming, so I think you could do both.\n",
      "Still the video speaks to the kid with the parent seeing it, but then again I think you also should probably have something talk to the parent in general about what to expect.\n",
      "It’s something that you should do maybe before they get here.\n",
      "Are you talking about having the video… well you don’t want to answer my questions, so… ha-ha... maybe you have an introductory set of videos that address this prior to them coming, so they do have an idea about cognitive behavioral therapy.\n",
      "Interviewer: So now that we’ve talked about who would be in the video, what about deciding where the video would take place?\n",
      "In the context of the video, would it be a home setting, school setting, doctor’s office, or somewhere outside like a park?\n",
      "Speaker: I would say that would depends on, and you guys would have more figures on this than I would, but I could definitely see one of them happening in a school.\n",
      "Let’s say out of a hundred people, 45% of the time, 50% of the time, things are school related, like my kid, they spend a lot of time in school that maybe you have one that shows the kid on school answering questions and showing, “Yeah, it paid to answer a question in the classroom,” or I’m looking over here at the other kid and thinking what she’s thinking about me.\n",
      "In that particular situation, sure, having a school video may not be a bad idea.\n",
      "Certainly something in the home, eh, that puts adults typically at ease, but where are most of these anxiety situations transpiring?\n",
      "Maybe that’s kind of the environment you want to have a video like that because that’s people are going to associate with their situation.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes. I do live alone.\n",
      "I have a one bedroom unit with a den.\n",
      "It's got a big bathroom and bay windows in each room.\n",
      "The kitchen is pretty small and that's where the counters are and that's where I have a lot of stuff that I put down.\n",
      "There's a box in the doorway where I've been putting stuff that I want to get rid of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You mentioned that that area that you mentioned a couple of times it has some stuff on it is the countertops.\n",
      "Are there any other rooms in your space that you feel like are of the same nature as the countertops?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "My craft room, which is what I'm making my den into.\n",
      "We hadn't gone through the boxes because I moved last October after I had the pneumonia.\n",
      "When I came back, they got me into a unit on the first floor, which was bigger, and some of the boxes and stuff haven't been completely unpacked with my crafts and stuff and I have so many different crafts.\n",
      "It's hard to organize the stuff.\n",
      "In my bedroom, I had been on a trip and I still haven't even put all my stuff away since I got back.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You mentioned that your den area/craft room and your countertops have a lot of things.\n",
      "Maybe boxes and items.\n",
      "Would you consider these parts of your home cluttered and what makes them cluttered to you if so?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "It's cluttered because, basically, I have to move things in order to allow somebody to sit on the sofa or love seat.\n",
      "I'm having trouble in my bedroom because I have kyphoscolisis and I have trouble hanging things up in the closet.\n",
      "I'm going to lower the shelves but I have had crafts and stuff maintenance isn't doing any broken stuff in the units, not while all this is going on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You did mention that your countertops are kind of unusable right now just because there are things on top of it.\n",
      "Would you say there are other parts of your home that aren't really being used in the way that they're intended?\n",
      "Are you using other items like the countertops for storage?\n",
      "And then I said, \"Okay, the next thing I want is the kitchen,\" which is right out the entryway.\n",
      "That just brings us back to there anyway.\n",
      "But while she was working on parts of the kitchen, I was out working at a computer station I've set up between the living room and dining room, because I had to move the computer downstairs for a connection problem.\n",
      "So, while she was doing one area, I could do another.\n",
      "Sometimes we're both working together.\n",
      "Sometimes we're working in adjacent rooms.\n",
      "It's a pretty open downstairs.\n",
      "It's a townhouse with a reasonably open plan.\n",
      "And sometimes ... I mean, I'm 69.\n",
      "I don't think I'm decrepit at all, but I'm not in good shape.\n",
      "So sometimes I'll just get tired in the afternoon and we've been working all day, and I'll come up and take a nap.\n",
      "And I know she's fine downstairs.\n",
      "She's not going to mess with anything.\n",
      "I totally trust her.\n",
      "So I'm able to work with her or apart from her.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, this is kind of just another question, I'm just curious.\n",
      "You said you don't really let many people in your house, so how did you get to trust her?\n",
      "Sorry, this is kind of personal, but ...\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I met her ...\n",
      "I'm trying to think.\n",
      "I met her through a friend who had ...\n",
      "I'm trying to remember this.\n",
      "A friend of mine had somewhat of a hoarding problem, and wanted to get help, and found [NAME 00:41:48].\n",
      "That's the helper's name.\n",
      "Found NAME somewhere.\n",
      "I don't know if she found her on the internet, or through another friend or whatever.\n",
      "But then I met NAME, and I was very comfortable with her.\n",
      "She's kind of a neat person.\n",
      "And I agreed with her about, let's say, 12 years ago, to work a little bit on my house.\n",
      "I left that out when I jumped from 2000 to now.\n",
      "To work a little bit on the house, and then she moved to Georgia.\n",
      "And now she's back in the area.\n",
      "So she's been back in the area for three or four years, but it was just this winter that ...\n",
      "It was right after I fell, really, that I finally said, \"This is ridiculous.\n",
      "I've got to get NAME back.\"\n",
      "I didn't want to spend the money, is part of it.\n",
      "And I thought, \"You have to do this, money or no money.\"\n",
      "And I was so relieved that she would come back, and her attitude, she's very non-judgmental.\n",
      "Her mother's somewhat of a hoarder, and her whole ... and she has other family members who have some mental health issues.\n",
      "Her attitude is sort of, \"People need help.\n",
      "I can help them.\"\n",
      "Interviewee: And patients are usually uh, at least my long-term patients are usually fairly honest with me in describing what I would see.\n",
      "And if they’re doing worse, they tell me that.\n",
      "“Oh NAME [20:38] it’s worse.\n",
      "I’m, you know, my hoardings out of control.”\n",
      "Often they’ll be able to at least tidy up some space so they can have a chair to sit in, tabletop to use, but sometimes they can’t even do that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you feel like…\n",
      "Interviewee: You have to, you have to ask a series of detailed, aggressively more detailed questions in order to get at it sometimes, but…\n",
      "Interviewer: But do you feel like people accurately describe their space?\n",
      "So I guess that’s another, the question is does it seem to be a problem where people don’t see the clutter in the same way that someone who does not have hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, some of them don’t, some of them don’t seem to have a whole lot insight and maybe the spouse is the main complainer, is the person reporting and complaining about it.\n",
      "And the hoarder may say “oh it’s not a problem, you know, those are valuable items, we need to keep them.”\n",
      "And the spouse is “no it is garbage, we need to get rid of it.”\n",
      "And other hoarders I’ve are treated are completely upfront, “I know it’s terrible, I hate it, it’s abnormal, I know it’s abnormal.”\n",
      "The ones who seem to lack insight tends to be a minority of the patients.\n",
      "Interviewer: That actually brings us really nicely to the next section of the interview which we’re going to talk specifically about insight.\n",
      "So as we kind of turn to those questions.\n",
      "The first thing I’d like to have you do is define insight for me.\n",
      "How would you define insight for someone with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Or how would you describe…\n",
      "Interviewee: The patient is, says “I’m a hoarder.\n",
      "I save things that I don’t need to.\n",
      "My house is cluttered.\n",
      "I can’t use, I can’t enjoy my house.\n",
      "And I know it’s abnormal.”\n",
      "To me, that’s uh, that’s good insight.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And it sounds like in your practice, most of the patients you see have fairly high levels of insight when you see them.\n",
      "Interviewee: Most of my patients have good insight.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Have you ever seen patients who have come in with very low insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you see those patients, do you have a process for helping patients try to gain insight or…\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t think you can, I don’t think you can.\n",
      "I don’t think you can teach them insight.\n",
      "They either have it or they don’t.\n",
      "So if I tried to spend my time improving their insight, I’d be wasting my time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And do you have a sense for the patients that you see how they acquired insight, if they always had insight into their problem or if something happened to help them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, the ones I am thinking of always had insight and over…I am thinking of one patient in particular whose hoarding has progressively gotten worse as she’s gotten older.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mm-hmm.\n",
      "And you feel like she’s just always been aware that it’s been a problem.\n",
      "Interviewee: She’s always been aware.\n",
      "She’s very distressed by it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: But she feels powerless to do anything about it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So it’s not a problem of her not knowing that, it’s an issue of…\n",
      "Interviewee: No, no. She knows.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any items in the bathtub or in the sinks or in the room?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Both of the sinks got some stuff in it, like Listerine bottles and a couple of things in the sink that can come out.\n",
      "There wasn't really any place to put them.\n",
      "Both from my husband's stuff leftover.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so you feel like, other than the bathrooms, all the other rooms are pretty cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Oh yeah, there's a hallway too.\n",
      "Stuff is lining the hallway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what makes them cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Boxes of stuff, piles of stuff.\n",
      "Boxes on top of boxes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, I know you mentioned prior that you've saved a lot of paperwork and clothes.\n",
      "Are those what's in those boxes or are those separate from what's in the boxes?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "No, that's in some of them, some of each.\n",
      "There's a bunch of Christmas and even Halloween stuff in there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, holiday décor.\n",
      "And how important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "And out of those items, what do you feel are the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "In the whole house?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, anywhere.\n",
      "So, basically out of all your items in the house, how important are your things for you to feel like you're at home with your things?\n",
      "And out of your items, what do you say are the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "There's a big carved mantle.\n",
      "There's a huge mirror hanging around the cape.\n",
      "There's an old piano in there but I don't know, it's really old.\n",
      "I don't play it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, do you think if those things weren't in the home, it wouldn't feel like your home?\n",
      "Do you feel like those things are necessary for you to feel at home in your house?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Those things are necessary because they've been there for 150 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, they're important due to their-\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "They're family.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Their family value but you wouldn't say you necessarily spend a lot of time with them.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What items in your house do you spend a lot of time with would you say?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I'd rather be outside.\n",
      "Well, I've been watching COVID-19 on the television.\n",
      "The dining room, I've turned it into an office.\n",
      "I spend time there.\n",
      "A little time in the kitchen.\n",
      "Sleep in the bedroom, that's all I do in there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you know your necessary items in the kitchen, your bedroom, your television, but you wouldn't say that the other items that are piled and the stuff in the boxes aren't really things you spend a lot of time with.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Well, they're just things that need to be distributed sometimes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would you say is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Probably my teddy bear that sings Que Sera Sera.\n",
      "It was my mom's.\n",
      "I had given it to my mom.\n",
      "Sometimes they would get her up and stuff by playing the bear because then she would get happy and stuff so she wouldn't fight them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I understand why that would be precious to you for sure.\n",
      "What would happen if you lost it?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "At this point, if I lost it I would be real upset for a while but I know I'd get over it because she had other things too.\n",
      "She had bears that I had given her that I recorded messages on if you hugged it.\n",
      "That stuff, those I never got back.\n",
      "And I obviously went through it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You'd be upset at first, for sure, but you know that it's something, okay, eventually, I'll be okay, I can get over it?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What's considered trash for you?\n",
      "How do you decide to discard it?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Like catalogues, I guess, for clothing and stuff.\n",
      "I always look for the dates of when something expires so when it expires I can throw it away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "But it's like, I might have a catalouge that's going to expire at the end of this month and I know that I'm not going to go buy something from there before that but I still can't get rid of it until that actual date.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Basically, when something's expired you know, \"Okay, I can't do anything with this\" then you're okay with discarding it?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Thinking about your home and your things, do you think that you have too much stuff?\n",
      "If so, how do you know?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I think I have, for one thing, too many clothes because I have severe kyphoscoliosis, which is why I'm in a wheelchair.\n",
      "I am bent to the side and forward and my waist does not align with my hips so I have to get clothes that ...\n",
      "It's hard to find clothes that fit that ... I used to have pants with drawstrings but then I found that skirts work better.\n",
      "I ended up buying skirts and dresses.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I still haven't gotten rid of all the pants.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Would you say that you might decide that you have too much when there is an abundance of things that you don't use anymore?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If you had to choose between your items, what kind of process would you do to choose?\n",
      "How would you choose between things?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "If somebody told me, you have a choice, you've got to get rid of everything but five skirts or whatever, I would choose the ones that I had worn the most recently.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Right, right.\n",
      "So, kind of just to take it one step further for healthy individuals there might be a degree of variance in the amount of free space they like in their home.\n",
      "So, some people really prefer to have clear spaces, like a clear desk, while others kind of like a little bit of clutter or don’t mind having things out and ready to use on their desk.\n",
      "Do you think hoarding disorder could be kind of an extension of this variance or is there… is that maybe [INAUDIBLE 46:48] below threshold, or is it something entirely different?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that it’s a combination of the two.\n",
      "I think that it’s going beyond kind of that range of the typical behaviors, but I also feel as though there’s, everyone starts feeling more overwhelmed or more paralyzed by the stuff than the other people may be.\n",
      "So, someone who does not engage in hoarding behaviors but has a cluttered desk maybe just doesn’t prioritize the sorting and filing of items, whereas someone who is more overwhelmed by hoarding… Hold on sorry I have to start over… So, someone who’s not bothered by hoarding they just… You know, “I just don’t want to deal with the papers it’s not a big deal.\n",
      "I can sit down and do it later.”\n",
      "Whereas someone with hoarding, “The papers are there.\n",
      "I don’t know how to deal with it.\n",
      "I’m avoiding rather than choosing to not deal with it,” because it’s more associated with feeling overwhelmed, feeling distressed in some way.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so my husband doesn’t care about his files, he just doesn’t want to deal with them, but if he needs to sit down and do it he has the ability to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok, ok.\n",
      "The last criteria of the DSM 5 that we’d like to talk through with you is one that says, “This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to the distress associated with discarding them.”\n",
      "So, again we were kind of wondering how you assess the degree of distress that somebody has with discarding an item, and whether this might be more difficult to assess in patients who don’t have a lot of insight about the disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think that if the individuals don’t have the insight, or they’re also far enough removed from their stuff, they may think that they wouldn’t have any difficulty letting go of the items, but then when they’re actually in the moment of dealing with the items, that’s when the distress comes up.\n",
      "But, they may not be able to anticipate just how upsetting it would be.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: So, you might ask a patient in your office, “Would you get rid of this item?” and they would say, “yes,” but then when actually confronted with the need to do it they would experience distress.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: But, they wouldn’t… they didn’t even know they would experience it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Or they would significantly underestimate the level of distress that they would expect to have.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: That makes sense.\n",
      "Ok, [NAME 49:41] do you want to take over with some questions?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: We appreciate your time, again we want to be respectful of it.\n",
      "I appreciate you… your answers are great so we’re kind of taking our time, assuming you have time, but if you need to end at any point just let us know.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok, sure.\n",
      "We are good, I’ve still got 88 miles to go.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: I don’t know why, but the analogy of one of the qualifiers for diagnosis of substance use disorder would be multiple attempts to cut back and not being able to do so.\n",
      "Similarly, trying to clean and bring your space under order and not being able to do so as an indicator that there may be a pathological problem.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok, I guess I’ll pick up with the next question.\n",
      "So, the next section kind of takes off really nicely from that point.\n",
      "We’d like to talk a little bit more specifically about the DSM 5 criteria and just to hear from you how you apply them and how you construe them and how you use them.\n",
      "So, you know, I’m assuming you apply these criteria frequently in diagnosing individuals with hoarding disorder and of course of your practice.\n",
      "Do you feel like, first of all, that there are particular elements of these criteria that might be particularly difficult or ambiguous, or that some clinicians might see differently than others, or do you feel like there’s anything in them that might have to do with the language or might be a matter of clinical judgement more than others?\n",
      "Interviewee: One part that gets… and I notice it’s kind of the language with most of the diagnoses in the DSM is kind of the rule out.\n",
      "So, if it’s hoarding disorder the behaviors are not occurring in the context of other diagnoses.\n",
      "But, I think just the… the fact that there’s such a high rate of co-occurring diagnoses with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "I think… I’m not sure if the statistics have changed, but like 92% of people who are diagnosed with hoarding disorder are also diagnosed with some other mental health diagnosis at some point in their life.\n",
      "And so, I think that because there is so much that goes hand in hand, I still diagnose the hoarding disorder, but there are times when someone is maybe feeling, “Well, no this is more just because I’m depressed.\n",
      "I’m not doing these things… if I wasn’t depressed I wouldn’t have the hoarding issue.”\n",
      "But, if 57% of people who are diagnosed with hoarding disorder are also struggling with depression, it can be really difficult to separate out, is this a consequence of the depression or is this a freestanding hoarding disorder in addition to depression.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And, how do you make that clinical judgement, how do you make that call?\n",
      "Interviewee: I go more based on what the level of accumulation in the house and how is it interfering... how is the clutter specifically interfering with the daily functioning?\n",
      "And, is that causing impairment separate from whether or not there is depression?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: So, you look at the space and the way that the space is impacting their life.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm, ok.\n",
      "Ok, that makes a lot of sense.\n",
      "And it sounds like… do you have the same kind of judgement calls to make in terms of anxiety or is it really mostly just telling if its hoarding or depression?\n",
      "Or, maybe not just anxiety, but other co-occurring mental health disorders.\n",
      "Interviewee: I feel like it’s much more with the depression.\n",
      "I don’t… I feel like with the anxiety it’s a more… it’s easier to separate the two.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And kind of along those same lines, just kind of thinking through the idea of intended use, because, you know, [INAUDIBLE 43:47] tend to use space in different ways.\n",
      "So, for example, someone who doesn’t ever cook, they might see it as appropriate to store things on their stove.\n",
      "How do you kind of figure that into determining what a good intended use, you know, of the space is?\n",
      "Do you kind of notice those are not for storage or is it a little more flexible than that, and how do you negotiate what counts as [INAUDIBLE 44:09] and what doesn’t?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, I think… I would say, you know, kind of separate from what the normal part is, the safety risk.\n",
      "So, if… even if they don’t cook, the stove is still considered like a hot space, and so if you’re storing things there even if you don’t use the stove it could still be a fire hazard, you want to keep items away from a potential combustible situation.\n",
      "But, otherwise I think it’s clearly… if it’s intentionally defined in a particular way.\n",
      "So, let’s say that there’s a second bathroom in the house, and nobody is using it.\n",
      "If that bathtub then gets converted for using for some kind of storage, so it’s not being used for its intended purpose as architects and builders designed it, but they weren’t using it for that purpose anyway.\n",
      "So, if it is being used for storage there would be the question of why is there inadequate storage elsewhere in the house?\n",
      "Is it a function of too much stuff overall, or is it making a distinction?\n",
      "This is actually what I did.\n",
      "I kept clothes that were being donated stored in the hallway bathroom kept in the tub because we never used it, but then my dad came and visited and turned the shower on and got all the clothes wet by accident.\n",
      "So, it’s a question of is it planned out?\n",
      "I think.\n",
      "And, what is the harm component or the potential risk associated with it?\n",
      "Just for the level of in the living space, not looking at the reasoning behind keeping those items, anyways.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I'm getting like $1196 a month for Social Security, however, I do have a supplementary trust that was setup by my dad, which helps me pay for ...\n",
      "Like the room where I'm living is like $3500 a month.\n",
      "It's not money that I can ... I mean, my trustee has to approve it and it's got to be used for something [crosstalk 00:45:38].\n",
      "They can't just hand me money and say, \"Go out and get this.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "What would you say maybe your approximate annual household income would be?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "The actual income that I see is probably around $23,000 a year.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is your geographic region?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Minnesota so Midwest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I had a year and a half of college but I didn't finish.\n",
      "Then I got an LPN license.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah, because when I'm just trying to survive those friendships go out of the way.\n",
      "And then of course people go, \"Why didn't you call me?\" Then your phone is broke either, but somehow how it's your fault that you did call them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Know what that's like.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "It sounds like also you have a group of friends who you have been friends with over a long period of time and because they kind of saw it develop.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "All my friends [crosstalk 00:18:41].\n",
      "Yeah, they're old friends, definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But there are still people who, you know you feel will judge you if they saw your space?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "But not all, not the core.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But your closest friends you're comfortable with.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, they haven't been in, in a while and they would be sad to see how bad it got.\n",
      "But at the same time too, I know that they would want to help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever had conflicts with other people because of this behavior?\n",
      "So this could be with friends or family or other people who are around your space, like landlords or neighbors.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I never had any issues with my neighbors.\n",
      "I wouldn't be surprised if the management of the office probably knows who I am and my situation.\n",
      "But no, because no one's coming in.\n",
      "I don't leave.\n",
      "I live alone.\n",
      "I've never lived with anybody except for my parents and my roommate in college.\n",
      "Yeah, I have had some roommates, but there was no issue.\n",
      "At that time I think everything had a place.\n",
      "And it's just to the point now where everything does not have a place to have an idea of where I would like to put everything, but it's like the Japanese or Chinese lady that has Marie [inaudible 00:20:17], who has that thing now, the tiding stuff, she's on Netflix and stuff.\n",
      "Do you know what I'm talking about?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Uh-huh (negative).\n",
      "I'm kind of out of the loop.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "There's this lady that has a book if she has a [crosstalk 00:20:35].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh yeah, the simplifier lady you're talking about.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Yeah, and so everything.\n",
      "And I think that's how I like to clean too.\n",
      "It's like to pull everything out, but if I pull everything out, and I can't get it done, and it's worst than what it was before.\n",
      "Does that makes sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Totally makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "So I have all the piles from where I've tried and then I began to have to step over those tiles because I don't have time to complete the entire tasks.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I totally understand.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "Either I get tired or need to go to sleep or something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And, do you think that when patients kind of come to you with that insight already that that is something that they’ve come to on their own or do you think that its often their families that assisted in the process?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s often either the family, but I feel like there’s been some kind of external event that’s been sort of almost like a wakeup call.\n",
      "So, they’ll have worked with people where it’s been somethings happened at their job where their job is… you know, they’re at a risk for losing their job because of the clutter.\n",
      "You know so being in the [LOCATION 55:24] area, I’ve had people from different government agencies that the hoarding behaviors have factored into maybe security clearances, and when that’s been brought to their attention and they could be facing charges for this behavior, “Oh wow, I didn’t realize it had been that bad,” when it’s been these behaviors were going on in this context.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok, so when they get some outside input.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think there’s been some outside input.\n",
      "I even worked with someone where she said, “If I didn’t have that outside input, if I’m not getting feedback about how my problems are… about how these behaviors are problematic, how do I know that they need to change?\n",
      "Because my perception is that I’m getting by and things are working out ok.”\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, and things can also, I assume, become dangerous when individuals with hoarding disorder start to isolate, because then they don’t have that…\n",
      "Interviewee: That outside calibration, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Ok, so in the literature there’s been kind of a breakdown of the concept of insight in hoarding disorder into different constructs and in different ways that lack of insight could be manifestations of other things.\n",
      "So, we kind of wanted to ask you how prevalent you find the following constructs in your patients.\n",
      "So, I know despite the fact that a lot of your patients, you said, already have some insight I’m just kind of curious as to whether you’ve seen any of these other things and whether any are more or less prevalent or problematic in your work.\n",
      "So, those constructs are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness and the distress, the idea of overvalued ideation, unreasonable belief in the value of the items, and indifference.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think I’m more likely to see the indifference, and I don’t know if that’s more of the reaction of, “I’ve been dealing with this so ling I’ve kind of stopped caring about it or how it might be having an impact on other people,” or almost like a withdrawal from the situation, almost like a learned helplessness or hopelessness tied into it.\n",
      "That could come across as indifference.\n",
      "And, I do think that the overvaluation either of items themselves or the efforts that they’re trying to undertake.\n",
      "So, “this is so important I have to do this.\n",
      "I can’t be bothered with something as trivial as the decluttering right now because the other things are more important and more pressing.”\n",
      "So, not having perspective on how important the decluttering actually would be.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: I think that falls into some kind of borderline category between indifferent and maybe overvalued ideation, not realizing what a big difference it would make.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well and then also not prioritizing the actions that are tied into the decluttering.\n",
      "You know, so then that’s decision making, how do you choose to spend your time.\n",
      "043\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. The interview is going to be broken up into two different sections.\n",
      "The first section being where we're going to make some lists.\n",
      "Then the second portion of the interview will just be us having more a free flowing conversation with some open-ended questions.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "As you know, the study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question that I want to ask you is what term you'd prefer me to use when we're talking about our difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I didn't understand that.\n",
      "I have OCD and I also have hoarding disorder but I don't have ...\n",
      "When you see like there used to be shows on where they would go into people's places and clean it up, I'm not like that.\n",
      "I don't have dirt everywhere but it's just a lot of papers that I collect.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Basically, my question is asking are you okay with the term hoarding?\n",
      "Do you prefer difficulty with clutter?\n",
      "What is your preferred term?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Probably difficulties with clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Those were great lists.\n",
      "That's it for our list making section.\n",
      "Now we're going to move onto the discussion section of the interview.\n",
      "The first question is can you please describe your difficulties with clutter and how long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I'm not sure how long it's been going on.\n",
      "Probably at least 12 years.\n",
      "What was the other part of the question?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just describing generally your difficulties with clutter.\n",
      "Maybe what that entails for you.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Basically, it's things laying around, because I haven't ...\n",
      "Part of my OCD is I'm very detail-oriented so with papers I want to file them in safe places and I don't get around to it so that's why it's laying around.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You would say, for you, it's really holding onto papers and documents that you desire to have organized but it just becomes difficult and maybe overwhelming?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you believe your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How severe would you say this behavior is?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "At this point, it's severe but it's not as severe as it had been.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You feel like it's improved over time?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I hired someone who's a professional organizer who would come in for a few hours every week and so we had got through quite a bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You've had a professional organizer come.\n",
      "What about have you ever gone to a different type of professional for help with this behavior?\n",
      "Like a therapist?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I've talked to my counselor about it and my psychiatrist who diagnosed it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How did you find the counselor or the psychiatrist?\n",
      "And the needlepoint, the things that I bought ...\n",
      "All the needlepoint is very special, quality needlepoint that I really want to work on and that I like displaying and framed or whatnot, or giving away.\n",
      "The knitting, half of it is for me, and half of it is for charity.\n",
      "So if I needed to get rid of yarn, I could give away the charity projects and things still go to charity, just somebody else has to put them together and knit them or something.\n",
      "My books are hard to let go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So would you say-\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I can let some books go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sorry, go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "I can let outmoded books go.\n",
      "I used to teach math and programming, and with that 1000 books I let go, a lot of them were books from college, and books from having taught lower level math.\n",
      "But now I'm even ready, when I go in the same room where the math books are and the computer books, I could probably get rid of all but one or two math books, and I could probably get rid of all my programming books, give away them.\n",
      "And so I'm ready to give away the topics that I used to have, to make room for my new books, that are newer topics.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, when you think about these possessions like your books and your needlepoint work and stuff, what makes them valuable, and how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "The needlepoints are valuable if they're quality needlepoint.\n",
      "They're not cheap ones.\n",
      "I don't know a nicer way to put that.\n",
      "They're quality needlepoints with wool, and they're beautiful designs that I think are artistic in one way or another.\n",
      "The knitting is yarn and patterns, sweaters and whatnot that I like or have plans to give to so-and-so.\n",
      "And the books are full of ideas I want to read and know.\n",
      "The books and the needlepoint are the very hardest to get rid of.\n",
      "They're either beautiful or interesting, or both.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, what about any other objects in your home?\n",
      "How do you decide if they're valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "You know what, I have a lot of pottery.\n",
      "I haven't collected pottery in a long while, so the hoarding of pottery is under control.\n",
      "I could still get rid of more stuff, but I put it in the basement, but I'm not buying it anymore.\n",
      "And that was based on potters whose works I'd like.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Yeah. If they just came, you know like they do on the TV show ... I haven't seen it in years, but the hoarding shows where they come in and just move stuff out?\n",
      "That would bother me.\n",
      "But the thing that works is with my friend that does come help me and I pay her.\n",
      "She's an employee when we're working on the house.\n",
      "But she knows the things that she should not get rid of, and the things she should be looking out for.\n",
      "And I trust her totally.\n",
      "I know her well enough that I think if things are gone when she's picking up stuff and choosing trash, and we have the piles that, \"This, you're going to keep,\" so that's the stuff in the dining room, and \"This is trash and this is giveaway or ...\"\n",
      "Well, the trash goes with the recycling, but then there's a whole set of giveaway stuff.\n",
      "And we just have a working relationship, but she seems to have a sense of what I might want to give away or not.\n",
      "And if she doesn't know, she asks me, and I know she will ask me.\n",
      "And the other thing that's really good is, at the end of the day, she has a big SUV, and she takes trash and the giveaways with her, which is helpful.\n",
      "One, to get them out of the house.\n",
      "And two, you can't decide, \"Well, maybe I'll keep that after all.\"\n",
      "And fortunately, I don't have any problem when it's out of here.\n",
      "It might be a book or something, some item that, \"Huh, I maybe wish I had that.\"\n",
      "And then I, in my own head, can say, \"Oh, come on.\n",
      "You have so much.\n",
      "You never even knew you had it.\"\n",
      "So I can be somewhat ...\n",
      "I'm in denial, the way I act, by staying up in my little room.\n",
      "But I'm not in denial as far as, \"This is too much stuff.\n",
      "We have got to do something.\n",
      "Let's get some reality here.\"\n",
      "So, I have that on my side.\n",
      "I'm not totally insane.\n",
      "Just partially.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I wouldn't say you're insane.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "Well, you haven't seen the house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's fair.\n",
      "So, I'm very curious.\n",
      "When she comes over, are you with her the whole time that she's going through stuff?\n",
      "Or do you go off on your own and work on a different part of the house?\n",
      "How does that work?\n",
      "Because you mentioned that she kind of knows, so I'm just curious.\n",
      "Participant 49:\n",
      "We do a mixture.\n",
      "That's a good question, because we started out with a plan ...\n",
      "Most of it's so close in time.\n",
      "I said, \"We've first got to be able to get in the entryway, so let's just ...\"\n",
      "And it took us two days to really clear out the entryway.\n",
      "I have no idea how efficient all my stacks and piles were.\n",
      "Some of them were.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm, and kind of just thinking through that and thinking about whether you can think of hoarding as kind of a thought process disorder or something that’s more biologically based, thinking about which came first.\n",
      "Was it the thought or was the thought just kind of justifying something that was already there?\n",
      "So, it is a disorder of the way that people think about things versus their thoughts are just kind of covering up a biological need of some kind?\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s a really interesting question.\n",
      "I think that there’s a piece of it where there’s already that initial urge or pull to keep the item and then maybe trying to put a layer of explanation over top of it to justify.\n",
      "But, then I also think that then that behavior gets reinforced and then the justification, you’re able to find validity to support that thought process.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: [INAUDIBLE 68:54] Well, that’s actually easily separable.\n",
      "[INAUDIBLE 68:57] But, do you think that it’s kind of biology, the need comes first and everything is kind of layered?\n",
      "[INAUDIBLE 69:04]\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, I think for some people, yes, but I feel like there’s going to be some individuals where it really it is really much more of a learned and modeled behavior than something that is kind of biologically almost pre-programmed.\n",
      "And, that’s why I’m thinking more, like, what life events have they had?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: And do you think… Right, right so some of them perhaps it’s more of a learned behavior or something that they’ve done to cope with an event, whereas other people perhaps it’s more of an urge that then gets justified.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "And, do you think that cultural forces perhaps associated with value and self-worth and consumption and ownership of material possessions play any role in the development of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: This I’m not sure of, because with the talk I did earlier today one of the questions – this was for professional organizers – they had the question about shopping addiction.\n",
      "So, I did very cursory reading about kind of the pressures for being more materialistic and kind of the identification of feeling… how you’re defining your own sense of worth as associated with the acquisition of items.\n",
      "I feel like it does tie into the excessive acquisition behaviors that you would see with hoarding disorder or it can.\n",
      "But, I’ve heard enough and seen enough where there are people where they do the excessive acquisition, but then they also are able to let go of those items.\n",
      "So, it’s more like a revolving door, whereas I think with the hoarding situation the stuff is coming in and it’s staying.\n",
      "I know [NAME 71:17] had like a street map sign for one of the presentations where it’s talking about the acquisition and feeling good, almost like an addictive behavior, and then, kind of, the high wears off more and more quickly, and having that be an addiction.\n",
      "But, I don’t know how that compares to the general population.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "But if a person is very fearful of being discovered, I think that they probably put on a facade and I think that they will do anything not to be discovered.\n",
      "Because if you look at the hoarding specials and stuff, kids will say, \"I didn't know I got this bad.\"\n",
      "So the person on the phone is going to talk like there's not a care in the world or anything, or they're not going to complain about their space.\n",
      "They may complain about the rent or whatever.\n",
      "So unless they tell you, sometimes they're not going to be able to just discover, because I think that there's more of us walking amongst them to various degrees, just that certain people have worse cases than other people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I don't think-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I don't think you can look at stuff yourself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so it sounds like you definitely could have ordering disorder and nobody could know if they didn't see your space.\n",
      "And probably there's a lot of people who have varying degrees that are able to hide it and kind of keep it under wraps.\n",
      "And it also sounds like you said that sometimes people might be able to see your workspace or see some other space and maybe think that you're not organized, but that for the most part, it's something that is easily hidden.\n",
      "Where do you learn about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where do you go to get information about it?\n",
      "You mentioned reading about it and learning about it.\n",
      "What are the main sources of information you have about it?\n",
      "Participant 50:\n",
      "I usually look at the internet.\n",
      "I've gotten a few books on hoarding on Audible.\n",
      "So I'm one of those people that I tried to do the research.\n",
      "That's why when I go to them, if they're just like five easy steps, it doesn't quite work for me unless there's that other component to be able to talk my language, if that makes sense.\n",
      "But mostly internet and books.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That totally makes sense.\n",
      "Do you watch the hoarding reality TV shows?\n",
      "Interview 010\n",
      "Interviewee: Hello?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Hello?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Hello?\n",
      "Interviewee: Hey its [NAME 3:30].\n",
      "Let me try to figure it out… I had you on my Bluetooth.\n",
      "It should be on Bluetooth now.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "We can hear you.\n",
      "Can you hear us?\n",
      "Interviewee: I can hear you.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Alright, how are you doing?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok, [NAME 3:45].\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: There’s two of us on this call so I apologize if we step on each other a little bit.\n",
      "And, I might interrupt, kind of.\n",
      "Yeah, I’m a graduate student working with [NAME 3:57].\n",
      "And [NAME 3:59], I believe you were introduced to [NAME 4:00].\n",
      "He’s a graduate student out of [NAME 4:02].\n",
      "And we’re kind of jointly conducting this project.\n",
      "And to just, you know, give you a really brief intro as to what we’re doing, I’m going to have you answer any questions.\n",
      "We’re kind of conducting interviews with people who are forming the, kind of, base group of clinical experts of hoarding disorder as it kind of grows from being established by the DSM-5 as a disorder.\n",
      "We’re kind of trying to gather knowledge from the group of people who are really the key clinical experts.\n",
      "And the purpose of this is both to understand what that knowledge looks like at this point in time and also to kind of… The second stage of our project is we’re going to be interviewing individuals with hoarding disorder, and so we’re going to try to do a comparison of the way that those individuals understand their own disorder and the way that it’s understood clinically.\n",
      "So, if some of the questions that we ask today sound a little bit odd, you know, just thinking about them as being framed in terms of comparing it to what a patient with hoarding disorder might say might clarify for you why we’re asking the particular things that we’re asking.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure\n",
      "Interviewer 2: That’s kind of like our short intro, sort of a disclaimer to give you some context.\n",
      "We have a lot of questions for you and I want to be respectful of your time.\n",
      "So, if it’s ok with you I can just…\n",
      "Interviewee: I am in the car.\n",
      "I’m actually driving back from doing a hoarding training, so I am stuck in the car for the next two and a half hours.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Ok so good.\n",
      "We’ll still try to be respectful of your time, but it’s good to know that you are not crunched, and if you need to go at any point or you’re distracted that’s totally fine, just let us know.\n",
      "Ok?\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "And, actually I’m going to switch you over to just my earbud here just so… because I don’t want you getting the sound of the – Ok I think you’re on the earbud now – just the sound from the road and everything kind of getting in my way.\n",
      "Ok there we go.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah that sounds clearer, thank you for that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure!\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah.\n",
      "Ok so let me go through our informed consent just, you know, to get you acclimated.\n",
      "I can answer any questions that you have at any point during our conversation, so just going to read you what we have for our informed consent.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So how severe would you say your behavior is now and do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I definitely believe my behavior's a problem.\n",
      "I think I'm an eight to a nine on a scale of 10.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And so when you said that when you were younger you didn't have many items, so you didn't ever have any problems pickup up after yourself or you just didn't grow up with much at all so that it just didn't happen?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, it's hard to know.\n",
      "I think I don't recall having trouble picking up after myself but I think it's because I didn't have much to pick up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "And I don't think I developed really good organizational things but I have things ... I have many things back from, easily back from late teens and I'm 73.\n",
      "So these things are very old.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change this behavior as you got older?\n",
      "Have you ever gone to professional help?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I have been working with therapists on it and I started ...\n",
      "It's usually the first thing that I bring up.\n",
      "Very few therapists that I've worked with have an expertise in this and they almost all felt that there were other problems that resulted in the hoarding behavior that if we solved those problems then the hoarding would improve.\n",
      "So we didn't work head on ... I think cognitive behavior therapy is probably the more effective thing to do for hoarding but it wasn't ... it hasn't been very much of that.\n",
      "Although the person I work with now is much better than anybody that I've had up until now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How did you find that person?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Ironically, through grief counseling and she was quite young.\n",
      "In fact, she, at the time, wasn't licensed as a therapist and I remember thinking, \"What could this young lady know about grief?\" But she's incredibly wise and more capable than anyone else I've worked with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So how does your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Have you ever had conflicts with them or maybe a landlord even?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "My father was probably sort of a hoarder, not too bad but somewhat and then my mother became a hoarder, only after she developed Alzheimer's.\n",
      "So she was kind of a check on his behavior.\n",
      "But once she started exhibiting behavior, she no longer ... after she got Alzheimer's she could no longer check that.\n",
      "I then moved into their house after they passed away, eventually I did and my sister came and we were going to go through the different rooms and it was impossible.\n",
      "Interviewer: …yeah, to impact it.\n",
      "In the literature, there’s been a breakdown of this concept of insight into a bunch of different constructs for many different disorders.\n",
      "They’re forming ones that have been kind of talked about in the context of hoarding.\n",
      "These are defensiveness, anosognosia – or lack of ability to perceive the illness and that something is wrong – overvalued ideation – which is the unreasonable belief of the value of items – and indifference.\n",
      "For you, do you feel like, with the patients that you’ve seen, any one of these four is the predominant problem of insight?\n",
      "And so being defensive, might be someone who just doesn’t want to deal with the problem versus someone who has anosognosia who really doesn’t see that they have an illness.\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean you see all of these things to varying degrees in most of the patients, but…I don’t actively think about those things when evaluating or treating a patient.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: I’m not sure, I’m not sure if it would help me one way or another.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: If the patient has no insight, I’m not gonna, I’m not gonna be able to give them insight.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Ok. Um, again kind of thinking through the understanding that patients have of their disorder, when you talk to patients with hoarding disorder about what’s going on with them, what do you think the patient would say is the underlying cause of their disorder?\n",
      "Do feel like patients have a sense of what has caused them to be this way or is there…\n",
      "Interviewee: So what you’re asking, what they tell me is the cause?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, I’m not sure.\n",
      "I always ask people, well why do you do this?\n",
      "“Oh I’ve always done it or my mother taught me to save.”\n",
      "Or some of the older patients would say “well I grew up poor and we didn’t want to throw things away because we might need them.”\n",
      "You know, like people who are old enough to survive the Depression.\n",
      "Interviewer: And um, kind of in your mind as you hear people give explanations either of the disorder itself or of the reasons for saving.\n",
      "So a patient might say “I’m saving this, you know, item because it has sentimental value or because I might need it later,” do you feel like these reasons…\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, they typically, they say those things.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you think that those are real, real reasons or do you think that they’re kind of post-hoc justifications for an underlying need?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would think that they’re justifications.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you think…\n",
      "Interviewee: Every patient justifies their illness.\n",
      "It doesn’t matter what the illness is, they all have some explanation.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you think that the behavior comes first and then the rationale behind the need…\n",
      "Interviewee: And then the rationale.\n",
      "Interviewer: …follows.\n",
      "Ok. Next we’re kind of curious of what clinical experts have seen with their patients in terms of the life course of hoarding disorder or in terms of how it changes over time.\n",
      "Do you have a sense for how long the hoarding behavior has typically been going on before you see patients?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, it depends on how old they are.\n",
      "Typically, for most people I’ve seen, they’ve had hoarding for years or even decades.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So…\n",
      "Interviewee: Many years or decades.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So do you have a sense for when in people’s lives it tends to begin, so in childhood…?\n",
      "Interviewee: Probably by their twenties.\n",
      "Sometimes their twenties, maybe before that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So what would you say hoarding disorder looks like?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Hoarding looks like, I mean, when you said that I just had the image of blackness.\n",
      "Hoarding looks like someone that is not truly alive, black like gangrene or something.\n",
      "There's a dead quality.\n",
      "Gangrene, I like that.\n",
      "That just popped into my head but it's like a deadness that keeps, if you don't amputate it, it keeps coming and killing more tissue and more of your body.\n",
      "It can win if you don't take action with hoarding.\n",
      "Is that the kind of image you were looking for or were you looking for something less symbolic?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I mean, that's not what I was expecting, I guess but that's a very interesting way to put it and it makes me think, is that how you ... when you think about your behavior, is that how you feel also or do you feel differently?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Oh no, I feel that I'm talking about myself here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I'm not judgmental about other people who hoard at all and I know someone ...\n",
      "I've also tried some classes and there are actually people in worse shape than I am but mostly because I have more room and mostly because I've done so much reading on the subject and so much studying on it and I know what ... I kind of know the techniques, the salami technique, the little steps, doing something physical and getting your brain rested and then not doing too big a project at once, something where you can get rewarded.\n",
      "I've done a lot of work to know how to do it, it's just getting myself to do what I know how to do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it seems like you're pretty knowledgeable, what things have you read?\n",
      "Are they mainly articles, books, or scientific journals?\n",
      "And like-\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "I mentioned Buried in Treasures.\n",
      "Anything Tolin has written I try to get ahold of.\n",
      "I have huge number of books on organization and I ... so they're not scientific, per se, but I will read anything on the subject that comes my way, whatever if it's popular publications or magazine articles or if it's scientific I'll read that, what the data is on it and as I say, this is what I work on with a therapist, as well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So where did you get these?\n",
      "Are people sending these to you or are you looking them up yourself?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about your husband?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I think he was fine with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, he was okay with how your collections of things and things that you were holding on to, he was okay with it?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "No, he wasn't okay with that.\n",
      "I was talking about the-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your change of location for playing dominoes, okay.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "So, how did he feel about your behavior in general and the condition of your house and everything?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Well, he didn't like it but he didn't really help that much either.\n",
      "He would clean up an area for himself, he'd put everything in the living room.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Contributing to the issue.\n",
      "Okay, so he didn't like it but you didn't feel that he really helped you either.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And have you had any conflicts with anybody or landlords or any of that sort due to your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "My son doesn't like it.\n",
      "And my daughter's okay with it, she's got the same thing going.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, your son doesn't like it.\n",
      "Do you think there's been any conflicts between you two because of it?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Well, he tried to help me once and some stuff fell over on top of him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh no.\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "And he tries to take care of things, he's really not physically capable of it.\n",
      "He's not that healthy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so after he doesn't like it but he tried to help out and maybe that situation maybe made him frustrated.\n",
      "So, has there been any other interactions between you two since then?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Right now he's mad at me.\n",
      "I haven't seen him for a couple weeks.\n",
      "But he could be very busy at work because they're one of those biomedical companies that are working on the COVID testing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you live in a house, correct?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "I live in my great-grandparents' house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and you live alone?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you describe what the space is like?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "There's I think a sunroom, there's like a , I've got a pantry and there's a door, and then there's off of that a combo office and laundry.\n",
      "There's the kitchen, there's a dining room, there's a large living room.\n",
      "There's a family room or bedroom, it could be either.\n",
      "And then there's a bedroom and a bathroom.\n",
      "So, a little bathroom on the other side.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And are there parts of your home that you consider to be cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Pretty much everything.\n",
      "The main bathroom's not so bad.\n",
      "Bathrooms aren't too bad.\n",
      "There's a large covered porch on one side that's full of furniture.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And in that main bathroom that you said, it needs a part that isn't available anymore to be repaired.\n",
      "Is it just unused or are there things in that bathroom?\n",
      "Participant 44:\n",
      "Oh, there's a bathtub and shower and two sinks.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about, any other of your relationships family-wise?\n",
      "I know you said your parents didn't really know about it, but what about other relationships has that affected?\n",
      "Besides maybe your roommate?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "My romantic relationships are stilted and definitely affected by the fact that I spend time at their places.\n",
      "They don't spend any time at mine.\n",
      "That can be, that has been an issue in various relationships.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do they know?\n",
      "Do they know about the behavior?\n",
      "When you say, \"No, let's go to your place.\"\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I express that it's a small space, and that we respect each other's privacy by not having company.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about work?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "I don't tell them that I've got piles and mountains of stuff.\n",
      "Work hasn't been affected at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, that concludes our kind of discussion portion of the interview.\n",
      "The last question I'm just going to ask is a couple questions about demographics.\n",
      "If, for some reason, you're not comfortable answering any of the demographic questions, no problem at all.\n",
      "Just let me know.\n",
      "So what is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Just male if you want, yep.\n",
      "Just male, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Race?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Sorry?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Race?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Say that again.\n",
      "I don't understand what you're saying?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, what is your race?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Oh, race, race.\n",
      "Race, race, yes.\n",
      "I'm Native American and Caucasian.\n",
      "Eastern Band Cherokee and white.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about household income, roughly?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Roughly about $90,000 a year, which is really poor in San Francisco.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And geographic region?\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "Geographic region?\n",
      "The West Coast.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "West, all right.\n",
      "And highest level of education.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "That's tricky, because I didn't graduate college.\n",
      "I only went to classes through about mid sophomore.\n",
      "But I'm an avid reader, and I can engage academically beyond my formal education.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 48:\n",
      "So I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, that's okay.\n",
      "Some college, that's totally fine.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok, ok.\n",
      "And, can you tell us, you know, what are the demographics of the typical patient with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, demographics of the clients that I see?\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, the clients that you see or if you think that there is a difference between the clientele that you see and the typical individual with hoarding disorder in the country, maybe speaking to that as well.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, well I think with who I see, it’s generally female, and with my client base its mostly Caucasian, but I know that that’s not representative.\n",
      "I think that’s more of where my practice tends to be.\n",
      "Age range, I’d probably put it at, probably in the upper 50’s for the clients who are seeking treatment.\n",
      "The age is starting to come down a bit.\n",
      "I do have clients now, you know, coming down to maybe more, low 50’s, upper 40’s.\n",
      "And then, socioeconomics, you know, again, the clients I see are self-pay and they are often self-referred, so they tend to be more either middle to upper-middle SES.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok, and do you feel like any of those demographics that you described are translatable to the hoarding population at large?\n",
      "Interviewee: I feel like the age definitely is, and I just feel like in general women are more likely to seek out mental health services than men are.\n",
      "So, that’s where the question of is it more being referred to services or seeking out services versus more of a crisis intervention where the clutter has gotten extremely worse.\n",
      "I feel like that kind of skews the sampling in there.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "And, do you have any idea why the age has been coming down, that you’ve noticed in the individuals that you see?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I think that there’s a growing awareness about the fact that there are services available.\n",
      "So, either people are aware themselves in wanting to seek out support or family members are more likely to intervene and encourage that they need to seek treatment.\n",
      "Yeah, I think that maybe previously there may have been a forced clean out without the supportive mental health services.\n",
      "Whereas now there is an attempt to do it in a more sensitive way.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "And can you think of a specific case or cases that were challenging to diagnose because they were on the border between pathological and non-pathological, maybe subclinical, and kind of talk about how you made that distinction?\n",
      "Interviewee: I’m trying to think of someone in particular.\n",
      "So, with one person, this was actually pretty recent, they tried to make the distinction between was it a mental health issue versus, as he put it, was it more of a management issue?\n",
      "More of a… was it a skill deficit?\n",
      "Where, if he just had the skills there wouldn’t be a clutter issue, and just during the process of the conversation as he started to identify his expectations for what his intentions were, what he wanted to do with the items, versus the practicality of, “would he actually have the time and the resources to do all of those things,” was one distinguishing element.\n",
      "Then also, being able to identify the past efforts to clean up at the encouragement of his loved ones and his inability to be able to do so.\n",
      "That was another indication that it was more of a hoarding issue rather than a skills deficit.\n",
      "Because, he had multiple attempts of trying to learn the skills and not being able to do so.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok, ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok, so the last question kind of ties into the next topic that we want to cover which is insight.\n",
      "And so, the literature surrounding hoarding disorder has described a number of people with hoarding disorder as often having low insight.\n",
      "So, can you tell us how you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it comes from, how did they explain the situation to me?\n",
      "And again, I’ve got a biased pool here because most of the individuals that I work with are… I mean they’re all voluntarily participating in services, so they’ve got some degree of insight.\n",
      "I think as they try to describe the level of clutter or the consequences that have resulted from their having clutter that’s where that level of insight… Do they see the… How well are they able to articulate a connection the clutter itself and, you know, if there’s some kind of negative circumstance that they’re experiencing?\n",
      "But, ones who don’t have as much insight are dismissing that the clutter is that problem.\n",
      "They’re tending to do more externalizing, I think.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: What do you mean, externalizing?\n",
      "Interviewee: Putting responsibility of the situation… they didn’t have the resources that they needed to be able to effectively organize the situation, the landlord was being unreasonable about how the space needed to be maintained, it really wasn’t problematic.\n",
      "I mean, I think it’s often that, you know, if there was some concern regarding eviction or child welfare, they got… the inspection happened on an off day where somebody did something the day before that made it more cluttered kind of putting the responsibility elsewhere.\n",
      "But, the majority of people that I have been working with, you know, they do recognize the direct connection between the negative situation and their clutter, they do have fair insight into it, but I think it’s taken a while for that insight to build.\n",
      "So, I’m coming in after they’ve kind of been in this process for a while.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "And, so do you have any knowledge about how patients successfully gain insight, or how you might help a patient try to gain insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that a big part is in as nonjudgmental a way as possible kind of trying to point out kind of how are things connected.\n",
      "How do these things feed into one another?\n",
      "So, being able to highlight patterns that they may have either not seen or atttributed to other causes.\n",
      "And, then tying that in with the nonjudgmental piece of it… because I think that one of the things that maybe someone might avoid acknowledging that connection is if they’re afraid they’re going to be judged or criticized.\n",
      "But, if it’s just straight forward and matter of fact, this is how it is but what can we do about it, kind of creating the hope or the potential that things can still be done differently, then they may be more open to acknowledging the connection that’s there otherwise.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I mean, I've still got stuff that I can look at and say, \"I haven't worn this for years\" but yet I don't want to get rid of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Like a swimsuit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "To choose between items, \"These are the items that I've used most recently which may mean I might get more use out of them and then the rest can go\"?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "It's also easier, for me, to get rid of stuff if I know there's a place I can use it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "It's like the cloth face masks I'm making.\n",
      "I have lots and lots and lots of fabric.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "I'm able to get rid of some of that fabric by putting it to use.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you say are the most important differences between collecting and saving and then hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Hoarding is probably ...\n",
      "Well, hoarding is unnecessary.\n",
      "Actually, the word collecting, to me, fits almost into the negative category.\n",
      "To me, in a sense, hoarding is collecting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You would say the difference between saving type behavior and hoarding and/or collecting would be continually keeping items that are not of use?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would you say hoarding disorder looks like?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "To me, it's having too many things that I know that ... A lot of times when people refer to hoarders, I think of the show Mission Organization where somebody's got trash and then even dead pets and stuff living underneath the stuff.\n",
      "My place is nothing like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You might define ...\n",
      "Would you say that it's on a spectrum then?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Can you repeat that?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say it's on a spectrum?\n",
      "Would you say there's different levels of severity in terms of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Based off of the things you kind of mentioned what hoarding looks like, would you say this is the same or different from your behavior of difficulties with clutter?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Can you repeat that one more time?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "When I asked what does hoarding disorder look like, you described this lower side of things piling up but then you also described what you've seen on reality TV shows where there's trash and maybe they haven't taken care of their pets.\n",
      "You described it as two different ways to describe hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Would you say either or those, or even somewhere in between, is the same or different from your difficulties with clutter?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "Mine is the papers and stuff and clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But you wouldn't say that really keeping trash and things like that is an issue for you?\n",
      "Participant 043:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being inside their home?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "See the problem is I actually don't have to get rid of things.\n",
      "I just keep sticking them into another box.\n",
      "So I don't do very much of that and that's a muscle I need to work on.\n",
      "But I am working to get a box ready to donate and I'm trying to cull through ... I see it like an onion where you take a easy, the first layer off.\n",
      "It's like low hanging fruit and then I'm trying to keep going through again and again.\n",
      "Some people say if you haven't used something in six months.\n",
      "I guess I would say six years isn't even long enough for me but if you haven't used something for 20 years and you don't like it, maybe then it could go and then it almost always has to go to a landfill because nobody else would value it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "But I do have a box here I'm putting things in.\n",
      "I found some glass thing my mother had in her bathroom just recently and I took one look at it and I didn't like it and I thought, \"No, they will like this at Salvation Army.\n",
      "They'll be able to sell it to some other person that likes a thing like this because there's not a chip in it.\n",
      "It's in perfect condition and that, I can put in the box, finally\".\n",
      "That's a breakthrough for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "So do you think that you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Without a doubt.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How do you know?\n",
      "How do you know when you just have too much, when it's time to maybe try to get rid of something?\n",
      "Participant 45:\n",
      "Well, my goal is ... in fact I had my upstairs ... I have a reverse plan house.\n",
      "So I have a living room, dining room, kitchen, upstairs.\n",
      "And I had the living room, dining room, which are open to each other, cleared out enough so the book club could come here a couple, a few, three times.\n",
      "But then I started doing some remodeling in the kitchen and it's now terrible.\n",
      "The book club couldn't possibly come here.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, often it's because somebody else has judges their space to be kind of a risk, and so you go into their home to assess the safety and to see if it really is a risk.\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer: Earlier I asked you for a list of ways that you could tell a person had hoarding disorder, and I wonder if in addition to kind of the objective list, when I do these interviews with clinicians they sometimes say that like if they were to look at a waiting room at a new patient, they would often be able to feel like they could tell if that person was coming in for hoarding problems, and they kind of give almost like a stereotypical picture of what that patient looks like. I wonder if you have a sense, if a patient is sitting in your waiting room, you've never seen them before but you kind of can guess that they're there for hoarding problems. What does that person look like?\n",
      "Interviewee: So, well there are I guess times where I have an idea that they may have it, but I also want to add that a lot of people have hoarding problems and they don't look like it at all. Many of my clients work full-time jobs and they work in government jobs and they work as teachers or whatever, and they don't look at all like they would have a typical hoarding disorder, but if I saw somebody that you know...they usually are carrying a lot of random things like shopping bags or reusable bags that have like a lot of paper or bottles. Sometimes they look like they haven't bathed or showered because they may not have the ability to shower often. They may look, sometimes they wear layers of clothing or have items that wouldn't really fit with going out to an appointment on them like quite a bit of books or papers or scrap papers.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like there are likewise kind of stereotypical personalities, like they tend to be a certain kind of person, they tend to have certain other kind of non-clinical personality traits?\n",
      "Interviewee: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: I know that a lot...just from my experience, my clients are so varied that I can't really say that there are certain personality traits. Maybe, you know...no I can't really say.\n",
      "Interviewer: So like for example, sometimes clinicians will say that their hoarding clients are particularly creative, are particularly bubbly or extraverted, want to be involved in everything that's around them, that's the kind of thing I'm getting at.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay, well I do think that a lot of my clients do think in very creative ways, like they may not be creative like art creative, but they can find uses for items that I would never think about. So, they can reuse objects or have ideas for certain things that they can create or use them for, but for me my clients vary so much from extraverted to introverted, it just kind of depends on the person. But yeah, they do have very creative minds and often seem a bit disorganized. Like, they can't organize, it may not be about their items or their space, but they sometimes have very disorganized thinking. So, it's hard for them to stick to one topic at a time when talking. They'll kind of move around in the conversation and get distracted.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Um, so one of the difficulties with this disorder in the long literature, and I'm sure you encounter it in your work and in your life all the time, is the problem of insight and one of the diagnostic criteria reads, \"The difficulty discarding is due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discarding,\" and I'm wondering how you think about distress in this context, when people will often deny that they are distressed by kind of the state of their home and they may also deny that they would be distressed if they had to discard their items? So how do you think about that? How do you think about the way that that distress fits into this diagnosis?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, when we're talking about most of our clients don't have a whole lot of insight, right, so they're like \"no everything's fine.\" You know, what we often try to do is get them talking about the way the stuff isn't actually working for them, whether it's about housing or they can't find their remote or they're tripping. And so, for us often the distress is apparent even if it's not apparent to them and so a lot of time our work is really focused on how do we get them talking about the ways that maybe things aren't going as well as they are telling themselves they are because to some degree I think that saying that everything's really okay it's not a big deal is a great way to have to avoid the reality that maybe things actually aren't as good are they are, or as they seem. And so, I think that that for us a lot of times it's we see the distress and we see the impairment in functioning whether it's distress by the individual or someone else and so a lot of times for us it's really having the conversation and getting them to articulate how stuff's not working so well--even if we're doing it in a way that's not directly saying, \"well I don't think this is working so well.\" It's really kind of saying, \"you know it sounds like on the one hand stuff is feeling great, and on the other hand you lost your keys or you can't find your medication\" or kind of tell them more about the ways this stuff isn't going the way you'd like it to.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like a major task for you, with a person with hoarding disorder, is helping them to experience or to see their own distress.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, kind of to turn the conversation towards that problem with insight, how do you define insight or low insight in this context? What does having insight mean for a person with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know like with everything else, I think that depends on the person. Sometimes it can be understanding that they've got the problem and why that may be, sometimes significant change in insight for someone might be acknowledging that they can see why another person might see and issue, even if they are not ready to admit it but they're ready to do something to at least start making somebody else happy and then kind of finding their own ways. You know, so a lot of our work is getting people to go from \"there's no problem, why is everybody picking on me?\" To \"okay well maybe there's an issue.\"\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you think about the individuals you've encountered with this disorder, do you feel like it's more connected to the reasons that they give for saving individual items? Or do you feel like there's a component that is about how they like their space. So, maybe patients might describe their space as being cozy, or needing to feel enclosed by items. How do you feel about that?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it depends on the person. We've heard both, sometimes in combination and sometimes not. And so I think it's tough because it's such an individualized set of reasons for why people save, right, and I think that that's part of the challenge. So, for some people it might be a feeling of safety, while for other people it might be more utilitarian.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you talk to people and when you have talked to people about their reasons for this behavior, and this is totally subjective, this is 100% your opinion, do you feel like the reasons that people give for saving items are what's driving the behavior, or do you feel like the behavior comes first and then the person is kind of justifying the behavior by giving these reasons? Does that make sense? Is it more of an impulse that the person does, they save and then when you ask them why they give you a reason why? Or is the reason really driving the behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, that's a good question and I actually don't feel like I know the answer.\n",
      "13:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "So he keeps stuff in there too, it’s not just you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "He does. Yeah, and I have to say, he… you know we bought one of these electric fireplaces sort of units, and oh this is nice, and he happens to work at a home improvement store, so he bought another one that we’re not using now, and he stuffed it in my daughter’s bedroom. And then, you know, we were talking about needing a fan so we bought an indoor air conditioning unit, not just a fan, which got stuffed in my daughter’s bedroom, unopened. And we also have, he picked up where he works, an actual window air conditioning unit which is sitting here in the front room. So, some of this clutter is his! But most of it’s mine because I just turn my crap on top of it. So, yeah, there’s some times, like the front room here is the most cluttered, and it’s mostly my stuff, and it’s like clothes sitting on top of boxes, you know, one of which is….\n",

      "Yes, that’s right, that was most of it, yes, and the boxes of both air conditioners are here, and opened and unopened boxes of stuff. And camping equipment and a wheelchair and other stuff.\n",
      "16:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so.. Oh is that your dog?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "16:22 Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh that’s okay, I have little dogs barking all the time too. So, what would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I would like it to be at least uncluttered so that people can sit on the couches or use the bed that we have here in the front room.\n",
      "16:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so just a little less cluttered so that you could entertain more?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, because it’s embarrassing for both my husband and me. We never have people here because it’s just cluttered and no place to sit and well I’m not great at housekeeping either.\n",
      "17:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "How important are your things for you to feel at home in your space?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know, I feel good that I have the things that I do, and you know, I’m trying not to get more things. You know, it’s nice that I have them, I don’t… you know, the only things that worry me may be perhaps like a fire or something like that.\n",
      "17:35 Interviewer:\n",
      "So safety is definitely an issue.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. 17:39 Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there things that you keep that have sentimental value or?\n",
      "29:19 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and what do you think about when you hear the words “hoarding disorder?”\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think, you know, somebody who has a uh…. Well for a lack of a better term, mental problem, and, you know… I don’t know, because these people are hanging on to things because they can’t get rid of them, and mine is more like I’m too lazy to go through and get rid of stuff. I don’t generally have a problem disposing of things or getting rid of things, unless it’s something that, you know, either has memories or it’s something that I’m collecting. Yeah so, I don’t know if I’m just lazy and don’t want to do it.. I don’t know!\n",
      "29:17 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so in our last section, I just have a couple more questions for you. Do your problems with clutter upset you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. It upsets me, you know, because we can’t really have people in here to have like a dinner party or anything. There’s no room. It upsets my family. It gets in the way of everything, you know, it always pisses my husband off, and he gets pissed off at enough things, you’d think I'd be able to control this to where it’s one less thing he’d be pissed about.\n",
      "30:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so you mentioned that it gets in the way of everything, so would you say it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not so much, you know, if we vacuum around it, but you know, it’s in the way because the room cannot be used the way it’s supposed to be used. There’s not enough room in it with all the clutter in it on top of things, and it just looks disorganized and messy and, you know, you don’t really want to have visitors or friends come over. I look at other people’s houses and they’re all clean and lovely and lots of space and no problems. And I look at my front room and it's embarrassing! And it looks like I’m, for lack of a better word, trailer trash or something. Yeah it is a better word! My daughter’s here!\n",
      "31:11 Interviewer:\n",
      "So could you describe a time where your clutter got in the way of something you really wanted? I know you mentioned that it’s difficult to entertain and have people over because it’s embarrassing to you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well more importantly than being embarrassing, the way that I couldn’t house my daughter here the way that would be best for everyone was really impacting the lives of everyone else in this house, so that was a big impact for about a week here.\n",
      "31:51 Interviewer:\n",
      "So definitely it gets in the way of your family time.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And just being an eyesore, you know, the fact that my husband can’t stand it. It’s just all around bad.\n",
      "32:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and has your clutter ever impacted your work?\n",
      "Interviewer: How do you handle a child not speaking?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes. He’s literally spent lots of sessions not saying a word.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So that was a question that you had.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, like how do you handle that? Here, I didn’t have anything specific.\n",
      "Interviewer: Other than that, that was the major question, but other than that, you didn’t have any other questions?\n",
      "Speaker: Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. What did you want to know about CBT when you first started sessions here?\n",
      "Speaker: I can’t think of anything specific, just how it will happen, how we can help him, what to work on each week.\n",
      "Interviewer: How much did you know about CBT from movies, TV, the internet, or other people before coming here?\n",
      "Speaker: Therapy in general.\n",
      "Interviewer: Tell me more.\n",
      "Speaker: Just experience- his older brother is autistic and has generalized anxiety so we’re going through that with him, as well as group therapy for social skills training. My mother went to therapy for years, decades, so I just grew to her experience. I didn’t really have any expectations, just getting help.\n",
      "Interviewer: Did all or any of your experiences, or what you knew about CBT match your experiences here?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: How so?\n",
      "Speaker: It’s been going well for him, definitely making progress. One step at a time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Thinking about your experience, were there any parts of therapy that were confusing?\n",
      "Speaker: I wouldn’t say so, no. it’s made sense. It can be slow going, obviously, but that’s to be expected.\n",
      "Interviewer: What would you want to tell someone who’s about to start CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Stick with it. It’ll take time. You get out of it what you put into it- which is what I work with him on, because if he’s not saying a word then it’s just a waste of time. So yeah, just stick with it, you’ll see improvement, and you need to participate to help it work.\n",
      "Interviewer: Think of 3 words that describe how you felt about CBT when you first learned about it. What would those words be?\n",
      "Speaker: Hope. Progress. Work.\n",
      "Interviewer: Hope, progress, and work.\n",
      "Speaker: You got to work at it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. If you were to add a picture to each of these words: hope, progress, and work, if you were to add a picture to each of these words, what would it be?\n",
      "Speaker: Work I guess would just be like a notebook or something, like just thoughts journaling. Progress… just like a graphic that I would attach to it?\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhm.\n",
      "Speaker: Like a reward, like a ribbon or something… reaching goals. Hope… sun? Something to look forward to. Happy.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you ___ the sun with happiness?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah. Bright.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so tell me a bit about why you chose each picture with each word. So you had journaling for work. So what was that for?\n",
      "Speaker: The thought that has to go into it. The whole thing of you’re going to get out of it what you put into it. [6:30] ____ the progress for him, we break down the small goals and reward him as he reaches them. So it’s sort of like a ribbon, a generic, he doesn’t get a ribbon, but it’s kind of like a generic thing for meeting a goal. Then the hope I guess was just something kind of seen as positive or happy- the sun or smiley face or something.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sounds good. The goal of CBT is to reduce anxiety overall, and if someone were to ask you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life, what would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: Even when things are going well, their anxiety can mess it up. My eldest child says that he’s stressed when he’s not stressed, because he thinks he should be. Like if things are going well, he’s worried he’s missed something. Yeah, so when things are going well or going right, then they’re anxious that there’s something else that they’re missing.\n",
      "062\n",
      "00:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so as you know, this study is investigating individual behaviors and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question would be: what term do you prefer when we refer to your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, anything you want to call it is fine.\n",
      "00:23 Interviewer:\n",
      "That’s completely up to you! Some patients don’t care and just call it hoarding disorder, some patients call it clutter, so whatever you prefer.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, clutter, because it’s not that i’m trying to keep things [00:37] INCOHERENT going through them.\n",
      "00:39 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay so, difficulties with clutter would be your preferred term.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "7:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that’s a great list. So now we’re going to go on into a more conversational like I ask you a question, and you can say whatever you want part of the interview. The first section is going to be about your own behavior and your own problems with clutter.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. 8:03 Interviewer:\n",
      "So, can you please describe your clutter problems and how long this has been going on?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I mean I’ve always been messy and cluttered, even when I was a child, you know, I would just stuff things in the drawers and whatever. And I’m pretty sure my mom suffered from some form; she would always have all these stacks of newspapers around and things. But she was not as messy and that sort of thing as I was, but I was always just sort of lazy. Lazy is the prime reason that I’m this way, and secondarily, I look at all these piles, and like I said, I get kind of scared and then I don’t want to deal with it, and I’ll put it off, and pretty soon I’ve done nothing for months, you know, that sort of thing.\n",
      "9:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "So you mentioned being scared. Could you elaborate more on what scares you about these piles of things that you’ve accumulated over time?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I don’t know, just having to start going through them and… I don’t know that it’s boring, but it’s really abhorrent to me. I don’t know why I don’t want to deal with it, and you know, it’d be so much easier if I either say folded clothes and put them away or dealt with things immediately after getting them or putting them in their place, but then there’s so many things too that come in that pile up and you know, I kind of spend a lot of time in the front room, so everything kind of winds up in the front room.\n",
      "It’s a mess. It’s easier if I have somebody.. If I can have someone’s help and like point and tell them to do stuff.\n",
      "10:12 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right. It’s always nice to have someone to help you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, like this 1-800 Got Junk? Commercials look really appealing.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you have clients who will pick up a piece of trash and say like, \"I could sell this and make $500\" or is that pretty unusual?\n",
      "Interviewee: It's pretty unusual. Like, I do see clients that they do think that they can sell something, but there's usually some logic to it. Like it is an electronic, it might be 20 years old but there is a possibility that someone somewhere may want this old DVD player because it still works. I can understand some of their logic in that, but they may not have like the full ability to understand, well what's more important? Your health or getting 5 dollars for this DVD player? So I think they do have, they overvalue certain things and they will think of multiple uses for items and think that they can use it for multiple things, but they don't really look at cost versus benefit.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, right right.\n",
      "Interviewee: How long is it gonna take you to do this? And you're about to be evicted, so.\n",
      "Interviewer: But it's not like a full-on delusion where it's like this--\n",
      "Interviewee: Sorry, can you say that again?\n",
      "Interviewer: It's not like a full-on delusion in the sense that it's not a totally irrational belief. It's not that they're completely pulling something out of left field. It makes sense, it's just that it's not really reasonable that they'll go through all the trouble to do that behavior of selling it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, yeah like I've never really had someone look at a pop bottle and say, \"I can sell this\" like \"oh I can use this for water,\" but if they're looking at 15 of them they don't say, \"I can use all 15 for water.\"\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you ever encountered individuals with animal hoarding problems?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you feel like that's a kind of object hoarding? Do you feel like it's the same sort of thing, or do you feel like it's a completely separate problem? And how do they differ?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it's a completely separate problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, do you want to talk a little bit about what you think the major differences are besides obviously that one has animals? [laughs]\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think that the reason for hoarding is completely different. And I don't work with people with animal hoarding like regularly or anything, but I think that the reason for hoarding is completely different. They don't have difficulty with decision making the same way, they don't have...like they have an emotional attachment, but I think that they might be stemming more from attachment issues rather than emotional attachment to objects or difficulty understanding like useful or non-useful things. So, I think it is more like...it's stemming from like attachment issues. Like people attachment issues.\n",
      "Interviewer: There's a difference in where the emotional attachment is coming from, if that makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and maybe a difficulty understanding their ability to care for something rather than difficulty decision making.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like there's differences in terms of the level of insight that people tend to have?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sorry, so the last of the criteria that I'd like to talk through with you is about distress and it's gonna move us into a conversation about insight that you've kind of already foreshadowed, and the criteria reads, \"this difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them.\" And so the question that I have is about how you're determining distress in this context? If a patient has very low insight and doesn't think that their hoarding is a problem, you know, denies that they are at all distressed and says they're perfectly happy with their space the way that it is, how is the distress kind of criteria met or if the person says they're not impaired, how do you determine what constitutes impairment?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah I think the distress question is slightly more difficult than the impairment question. I think often times it is the collateral context, the people around the person with hoarding that are the distress markers, if you will. So they are the family members or the housing inspector or the child welfare organization, are the markers of distress so they are the ones who are bothered by the saving and the manifestation of the objects, and sometimes in the face of that evidence in clinical interview I have been successful in having clients acknowledge at least why others might be distressed, even if they are not distressed. So they continue to deny their own, but are willing to say, \"yes I hear it from other people and I can see why they would be bothered and/or worried.\" So that's one path that I take in clinical interview for assessment purposes of distress. I think the measures--and I would say that the measures that we have, the standardized measures, you know the hoarding rating scale or the saving inventory revise very little in these ways. They do more in the area of impairment if the person has some amount of insight, but we know that insight of course, or lack thereof, is part of the pathology of this problem. It's also fluctuating, right, so in any given moment a person may be able to say, \"yes this is deeply impairing and deeply distressing\" and in the very next moment they may deny both of those things, again as part of the illness. So I think both, for me clinically, both distress and impairment is part of my clinical interview more than, I come at those things through the clinical interview more than I use those standardized assessments. I don't think what we have available right now does a very good job.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So if you can’t think of 2 other words, that’s alright. But hopeful is a good one. So that’s all the questions I have. Do you think there is anything that I missed or anything important that you wanted to talk about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: It’s been extremely helpful for [NAME REDACTED].\n",
      "Interviewer: Fantastic\n",
      "Speaker: It really has.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well, I think that’s it. Thank you so much for participating.\n",
      "Interviewer: Alright, thanks so much for meeting with me today. I am with a group of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists working on a project to make videos about cognitive behavioral therapy which is the therapy that’s done here at this clinic. So cognitive behavior therapy is a mouthful, so I’m going to refer to it as CBT throughout this interview and we just want to get your perspective and your general thoughts about the therapy. So to start, could you tell me what comes to mind when you think of or hear CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: CBT? Um well it is a technique used for the treatment of variety psychiatric psychological disorders where you try to use graded… graded and guided approaches to modify the responses and the anxiety associated with particular types of responses often through exposure or other sorts of I guess controlled environments and providing a safe environment for individuals to…I guess uh… become cognitively aware of their physiological responses to adverse stimuli that cause them anxiety or distress.\n",
      "Interviewer: So that sounds like there’s, to sum everything up, it sounds like there are a lot of skills that are learned in CBT and that these are things are used to challenge anxiety.\n",
      "Speaker: Well I think… I mean I think the goal of it is to ultimately give individual… I guess tools whether they’re behavioral tools to help deal with you know whatever their adverse reactions are or their anxieties to teach them approaches and method that will work for them when they are not there. So I think there are combinations of both… you know guided exposures, but then also demonstrating how they can utilize those in the future. [03:42] ___ it can be used alone or in combination with…You know pharmacological therapy.\n",
      "03: 58 Interviewer: It sounds like yeah a lot of ways and techniques that you can combat anxiety with CBT. So speaking of anxiety, one of the major goals of cognitive behavior therapy is to kind of challenge anxiety. In your own words, if someone were to ask you how anxiety becomes problematic in someone’s life, how would you response? What would your explanation of that be?\n",
      "Speaker: Well I think anxiety if it leads to an adverse effect on your welfare whether that yours ability to function in school or in work or their home life or in their relationships then I would say that the anxiety is of you know concern. I think that can be difficult to define. How does anxiety specifically lead to adverse effects? I think that it depends on the different type of anxiety and what they and what their specifically concerned about… [05:28] _____ it sort of depends on, but overall how it affects the individual and their function.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you give me some examples of potentially how because I know you mention that it does varies on the anxiety. What are some ways you think that could look like?\n",
      "Speaker: Social anxiety if you are anxious about social interaction it could lead you to avoid situations where you are going to have to interact with individuals and… so that could make it difficult for you at work or more extreme cases. You know not being able to carry out normal daily functions. So I think those are one type of anxiety.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sounds like it affects multiple things. You are mentioning work, school, and relationships.\n",
      "Speaker: mmhm yeah yeah. I mean it can manifest primarily in one or the other.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s where you say it varies based upon the person really.\n",
      "Speaker: I think also anxiety can often contribute to other psychiatric disorders like depression. It could coincident with other disorders… exacerbate their… manifestations.\n",
      "Interviewer: You mentioned the kind of like nesting or space kind of creation way of thinking about hoarding, and I mean there is a normal kind of degree of variance in the kinds of spaces that people like to inhabit. Like some people might enjoy a very clear desk, other people might really like to have clutter on their desk and have them feel productive and you know, so I guess how do you think about hoarding disorder in that way? Do you feel like its, that that kind of, that hoarding is a way of creating a comfortable space? Do you see that in your patients? Is that part of how you think about the use of space in hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I suppose I see it more probably than even just space, I think. The sociologist in me thinks a lot about the idea of home and how people make home and how objects serve as one way for people to make home, but that there's a whole body of literature in sociology about being builders and the nesting piece that we talked about within hoarding is not far from this idea of the usefulness of objects for building, this construct in sociology, and sometimes building is related to making home but sometimes people just build for the sake of building. And I don't mean that in quite the literal--so just to state that it's a construct. And so yes, I see it quite broadly and I think that the continuum is a long one and that we don't fully understand all of the elements, all of the variables, if you will. For example, cultural or geographic region variations in how people use space or the idea of building or building homes, I think we haven't begun to tap into understanding those pieces.\n",
      "Interviewer: It is really amazing and cool that you bring that up. That's actually a project that I'm working on, I'm actually an anthropology student [INAUDIBLE 44:57] PhD, so one of the things that I'm working on is a way of looking at what hoarding disorder can teach us about building homes. So, if that's interesting to you, I don't have anybody that I'm working with on this in anthropology or sociology, so if you wanna talk about that at any point I would love to have somebody to work with on that because it's just been a fun, interesting side project--cuz that's exactly what a lot of this made me think of when I started to encounter it, is what, how those two kinds of ideas or literatures are related. Anyway, that's a side note.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, feel free to contact me about that work. I'm in a collaboration with, I think you're also talking with my colleague she's [NAME 45:45] who's a clinical psychologist at [INSTITUTION 45:46] and we are in a collaborative partnership with a third person who's name is [NAME 45:51] and he is a sociologist where I choose to have my academic life and social work, he's in sociology and we're writing a paper right now with some of these concepts in them called, \"Making Room\" is our working title, but yeah I'd be delighted. There's not a lot of conversation about this, so anytime you'd like feel free to reach out.\n",
      "Interviewer: So in your experience as a parent of a child who has gone through CBT, what was that experience like for you?\n",
      "07: 34 Speaker: Well I mean I think overall it’s helpful in terms of… you know providing [07:50] __ … I don’t know. I guess for me I not really involved in the day to day. I only see the outcome. I would say at least for my older son certainly definitely seemed to help him and you know dealing with school and performance anxiety, you know those issues. So I think it has been positive for him. I think it has helped him gain perspective on what is going on. I think it helped to destigmatize it to a certain extent. I think it made him more self-aware of the issues and you know helped him deal with it so I think that there is some partial possible benefits.  So for me I guess it has been helpful. You know because of patient confidentiality you don’t really have much insight to what is actually happening on a day to day bases. Somewhat dependent on what the child tells you which… so I don’t have a good sense of what the individual activities he did or what… you know I have some sense they were essentially trying to you know throw curveballs and sort of disrupt you know such [09:58] ___  still function in a chaotic environment. I think there was an attempt to make it fun and enjoyable, not stressful. So I think that was… maybe something that I thought was… I kind of had a maybe bias that you know essentially it was more of a graded response and that you kind of helped people get over their level of anxiety with… elicited.  I don’t know I think I had an unpleasant association sort of with that idea that you would be sort of stressing them, and I think that’s what was most surprising to me was that it was not as stressful as um…. That my son actually seemed to enjoy it and look forward to it, rather than being negative as something to get through. That was definitely not… unexpected sort of so.\n",
      "Interviewer: In what ways was that unexpected umm, like in what ways was that unexpected for you? It sounds like there was a different preconception kind of going in to thinking what it would look like.\n",
      "Speaker: I think that my preconception is essentially stress them out until the anxiety subsides and that they don’t… you know that’s a difficult process because you have induce the anxiety in order to show that’s it’s not going to cause harm or the adverse [12:01] ___ are anticipated are not actually going to happen, and to me that worries me from what I think. From what I heard there was a lot of humor, a lot of ways to sort of deescalate the situation and made it a less unpleasant situation than I would have expected.\n",
      "Interviewer: Is that kind of the knowledge you acquired about it there being more perhaps to CBT than just the kind of like the mechanism side of things. Is that something that would be important for other parents to know if they are contemplating whether or not to have their child go through CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: When you say the mechanisms, do you mean like neurochemical reprogramming or do you mean the mechanisms in terms of what actually happens in CBT?\n",
      "Interviewer: I think more the latter where in terms of you expose yourself to a stimulus to induce anxiety and then learn that the feared outcome is not actually happening, but you mention that also there seems to be some fun involved and there were other things that made it..\n",
      "Interviewer: So, some outside influence or else like an actual health impact on their life.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, there's a really interesting paper that describes kind of lack of insight in this population, and it breaks the idea down into four constructs and I'd like to read you the constructs and have you kind of comment on whether or not you think that these are relevant to the patients that you see, and what you think are the most relevant. So, the construct are defensiveness, anosognosia, which is defined as the lack of ability to perceive and illness or that something is wrong or causing distress. The third one is overvalued ideation, which is kind of the persistent belief that the value of items is more than it is in reality, and then the final one is indifference. Of those four, and I'll read them again--defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideation and indifference--do you feel like some of them are more relevant and some are less relevant? Or do you see them all? Do you see none of them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Defensiveness, depending on how people come to me but yeah I think they're usually trying to give a reason as to why things are happening. Like why they're keeping something, or why it's not a problem and why other people shouldn't perceive it as a problem, they're I=kind of defending their behavior. I don't know whether or not, you know I often find that people are like that or are defensive because of past bad experiences they've had. When I explore it further with them, they have to become defensive because other people have said things like, \"This is disgusting\" or \"how can you live like this?\" So they immediately become defensive, but if often you have a good relationship with the person, you talk things further, they can get to the place where they understand that it's a problem, but their first reaction is defensiveness and it's usually because something bad has happened. I think often yeah they do have like a lack of ability to understand that there are risks, there are problems involved with what they're doing, until something else happens or somebody gets involved.\n",
      "Interviewer: Thinking about particularly anosognosia and overvalued ideation, I'm wondering if these are things you see in your patients. So I guess anosognosia might be a little bit more like you really look at a space and you don't see the stuff, you know what I mean? Like it looks normal to you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Whereas overvalued ideation almost sounds like a delusion or something where you look at the stuff and you really truly believe that it has value beyond what's rational. Do you see those two kind of ideas in your patients?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don't really see like my clients going into a space and seeing it as being normal. I've never really seen that, they often can understand...like they might not see the full risk of it or the full problem as other people would, but they don't ever, I've never had a client that looks at a really cluttered space and thinks that there is no problem. They do see something, and this is why they're not letting people into their house.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you think about the individuals you've encountered with this disorder, do you feel like it's more connected to the reasons that they give for saving individual items? Or do you feel like there's a component that is about how they like their space. So, maybe patients might describe their space as being cozy, or needing to feel enclosed by items. How do you feel about that?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it depends on the person. We've heard both, sometimes in combination and sometimes not. And so I think it's tough because it's such an individualized set of reasons for why people save, right, and I think that that's part of the challenge. So, for some people it might be a feeling of safety, while for other people it might be more utilitarian.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you talk to people and when you have talked to people about their reasons for this behavior, and this is totally subjective, this is 100% your opinion, do you feel like the reasons that people give for saving items are what's driving the behavior, or do you feel like the behavior comes first and then the person is kind of justifying the behavior by giving these reasons? Does that make sense? Is it more of an impulse that the person does, they save and then when you ask them why they give you a reason why? Or is the reason really driving the behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, that's a good question and I actually don't feel like I know the answer.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, right. I'd like to quickly drill a little bit deeper into this concept of insight. So, as I'm sure you know, the literature surrounding hoarding disorder often describes hoarders as having low insight, and I'm wondering how you as a clinician define the term insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that's a really good question. With insight I think how I determine insight is like the ability for an individual to recognize or yeah, to recognize that something is an issue or a problem, ultimately. So, this can come up in OCD a lot as well, you know, or this is actually another example that's related, like if someone is having relationship OCD or like is experiencing obsessions about their relationship, they might not see those thoughts as obsessive necessarily, because they might seem valid or warranted. Like, \"Oh this person's bothering me, maybe I sue this person, that's something that I should actually consider.\" So, in that way a person with OCD might not recognize that that's actually OCD and we need to target that in treatment as OCD, and so if they're not going to conceptualize it as OCD, we can't do exposure therapy and we can't treat it in the way we treat other OCD symptoms. So it would be very similar with hoarding disorder, if someone is not seeing that the clutter is an issue and is not able to have insight into the way that it's impacting them, and I think that's ultimately what I think of insight, I think about there being a disconnect between like the consequences. Like I guess not realizing or understanding the consequences of the behavior, so that an individual doesn't actually see their difficulty discarding as leading to relationship issues or leading to issues with them working or doing their hobbies. Like there's that kind of lack of insight into the ways that the problems are impacting them, is kind of how I conceptualize it. I know that insight, and actually somebody on our team who's a psychiatrist and again I'm a psychologist, he approaches insight differently and I missed his talk but he was just talking about the brain structures and the ways that the research on insight in general on different psychiatric disorders and how the brain, you know, what circuits might be related to loss of insight or a lack of insight in different disorders.\n",
      "Interviewer: And could you just walk me through the outline of that case?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I can think of maybe a couple of cases. I think where it can get tricky is that hoarding, or individuals who struggle with hoarding, tend to...or the traits tend to show up when they're relatively young, so like adolescent years. And I think that if someone is struggling early on, and they're not actually acquiring enough or having difficulties discarding enough where it's like resulting in clutter that's actually compromising their space or that's like a hazard, then according to the criteria, then it wouldn't be criteria for diagnosis. So, someone might be struggling with hoarding or acquiring objects excessively and might be struggling with discarding, but if they can still use all the spaces in their home, then that kind of puts you in a tricky spot. Because what if not giving this person the diagnosis means they don't get services; however, they don't meet diagnosis, so you can't give them the diagnosis because they don't have the clutter or the, if their home isn't compromised in that way and their space isn't compromised in that way, then you can't come up with a diagnosis at the level of significance where it would need a diagnosis. So that would be, you know, I actually haven't, the only place I've seen that come up is in our research study, because we're looking at folks who are a little less severe and because we don't, because or IRB, we're not seeing people who are being threatened with eviction or because we're going into the home, there can't be mold, there can't be...you know, clutter can't be stacked super high because of earthquake risk and things like that, and so we're actually seeing folks who do kind of fall in that line of is it actually hoarding disorder? Does this meet criteria? And I think for some folks we've had to say no it doesn't, because their home doesn't, the only thing they're saving is the revised inventory questionnaire, if it doesn't meet the threshold, like if they don't have that perceived need to save to the degree that causes impairment or causes distress, then we wouldn't diagnose. So I think taking a look at things like the savings inventory revised or the clutter image rating scale, having a person do those can help you see what actually, is this actually pathological as well as asking them more subjectively like what their home is like and what's their experience inside their home.\n",
      "Interview 022\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so now I'd like to move into the more kind of conversational portion of our interview, and just to start out if you wouldn't mind introducing yourself in terms of your background related to hoarding disorder, your education and how you encounter individuals with hoarding disorder at work.\n",
      "Interviewee: I was trained at [INSTITUTION 20:44] under [NAME 20:45], and so I've been working exclusively through my doctoral and post-doc and the beginning of my career work in the area of hoarding site 2005. This is both my area of research as well as my area of clinical practice, and I'm currently an associate professor in Vancouver, British Columbia at [INSTITUTION 21:14]. My work currently is primarily as a researcher, though I provide clinical supervision, I'm not providing direct clinical practice at the moment but I'm clinically supervising students and I'm also someone who does a lot of training and consultation. So I'm invited into communities around the world to provide clinical training, CBT for hoarding as well as other more community-based interventions using [INAUDIBLE 21:58] and cage management, and my research has been the area that communities respond to this problem when it becomes a public health and safety perspective. So, when it kind of crosses the line from being a private mental health problem to becoming more, that's my area of research.\n",
      "Interviewer: And for how long have you encountered hoarding patients, either through your research or through your clinical practice?\n",
      "Interviewee: Since 2005.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so for the first portion of the interview we're going to be talking about the ways that clinicians identify patients with hoarding disorder. And just to begin I'd like to ask you, for you what are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps collecting or any kind of normal saving, and hoarding disorder? Is it a spectrum? Are there clear delineators and if so, what are they?\n",
      "Interviewee: I see clear differentiation between concepts like collecting and hoarding, or someone who is just a bit untidy, if you will, versus someone who has hoarding behavior if not meeting diagnostic criteria, and for me there's a couple of pieces there. One is certainly about the volume of possessions, but that's only important in the context of the ability to carry out daily life activities. So I think you cross the line when you've got interference in carrying out ADLs and that accompanied by these strong beliefs and emotions certainly sets someone who is collecting or someone who is a bit untidy apart from someone with hoarding behavior. So I think pure physical manifestation is dangerous, I think we can't make an assessment based on that alone, especially when we're talking about diagnostic levels of hoarding. I think you have to consider those other features as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you think of an example of a case that was challenging for you to diagnose or that you felt was borderline or was an interesting sort of challenge to decide if it indeed constituted hoarding disorder or not? Have you ever encountered a case like that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, you know so it was not a question of--it was a differential diagnosis, the most interesting case but maybe that's a different question. Are you asking me only about did I know if it was hoarding or not hoarding? Or hoarding vs something else?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so that was another question that I was going to ask you about, actually, you know because there does seem to be this disconnect that many people describe hoarding as starting at adolescence, but most hoarding patients, patients with hoarding disorder don't come into treatment until they're unfortunately middle aged or in middle age and I hear you saying that part of that is it takes them a while to acquire enough items to meet criteria. I wonder if you think that there could also be a social aspect to that trajectory, people's children moving out of their house or spouses either dying or leaving, do you feel like those social factors--or I mean, conversely, should we see hoarding perhaps as a progressive disorder that actually worsens with age? I wonder what your opinion is and where it kind of falls out.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, you know anecdotally and from what we know, I think I tend to see it as more of a progressive disorder that tends to become exasperated or get worse over time, in general. I think that doesn't mean that that's always the case, though I think that's where more research is needed in terms of the role of like a traumatic experience. I mean there's some cases where someone maybe wasn't struggling with those symptoms at all and then they're 35 or 40 and then something happened, like a trauma might happen or some sort of stressful life event, and then they develop difficulties with the acquisition and discarding and the disorder comes from that. I think that happens less than what I know about the research, however it does happen. And so that is interesting how for some people it starts kind of insidiously at a young age and then just kind of progressively becomes exasperated, but for others it might not even be there until later in life and maybe a hypothesis is maybe some sort of event, stressor, trauma basically triggers a disorder for some personal reason. So I think that there might be a couple of ways that people can develop.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, so it might just be later in life, yeah. I'd like to return really briefly just to the concept of insight. So there was this patient published about insight in hoarding disorder that broke the concept down into different constructs, and I'd just like to read you the constructs and see if you think any of them are more or less salient based on your clinical experience. So the construct of insight that the paper described were first defensiveness, second was anosognosia or just a lack of ability to perceive an illness or that something is wrong causing distress, the third one was overvalued ideation, which was defined as a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items that can range from mild to delusional in intensity, and the fourth one was indifference. So, again, we have defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideation, and indifference, and I wonder if when you encounter patients that are having problems with insight, if you find one of those to be more common or more important?\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, and do you feel--I'm assuming that you've encountered also individuals that have problems with animal hoarding, because of your role. Is that correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like that's different for those individuals?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, we don't have that many cases that come across every year so it's sort of hard to tell.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: There's certainly a different level of attachment to the animals and an inability, when there's poor animal care, to be able to see it that feels a little bit different from object hoarding, but certainly that's not...again, we don't see that many so it's sort of hard for me to say.\n",
      "Interviewer: When you think about the individuals that you've encountered with this disorder, do you have any sense for how long the behavior's been going on before you see them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Certainly for most of our folks, decades. You know, dating back to late teens, early twenties.\n",
      "Interviewer: And I guess just as you encounter these individuals, do you think that it's like a progressive illness that gets worse with age, or do you see it more as a set of circumstances? So like, as a person ages they naturally become more socially isolates, their children might leave home, they might inherit things from their parents, they might have a fixed income, and that those are the things that make it get worse as they get older?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, we're not seeing people who are going out and actively acquiring all the time later in life, especially since they're frail, it feels like it's more of a, when you think about how much stuff builds up over a course of decades if you're not able to get rid of it, either through active acquiring or through things like junk mail that just come into our lives, it feels like it's more of a slow slide off of a slippery slope than anything else. It just kind of builds up and builds up and builds up.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, maybe it's more that the stuff has built up rather than the behavior has gotten recently worse?\n",
      "Interviewee: Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well those are all my questions, I really appreciate your time today.\n",
      "Patient Pilot Interview\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, perfect. Well thank you for doing that with me, we're going to move into the more unstructured fun part of the interview. Just to begin with just as we get into that, would you mind telling me a couple of sentences about your background related to hoarding disorder and how you encountered individuals with this disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: We started a program here at [INSTITUTION 6:11] in 2006, because we were seeing a lot of people who were losing their section 8 housing subsidies because of failed inspections caused by hoarding behavior. So we partnered with [INSTITUTION 6:26] and developed an evidence-based case management program for hoarding intervention to reduce the risk of housing loss due to hoarding behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what is your professional and educational background?\n",
      "Interviewee: My professional, I actually don't have an undergraduate degree, and my professional background initially was doing HIV/AIDS work in the mid 90's in North Carolina, and then moving to Boston and doing housing work as a community organizer around various housing issues. And then I started doing some work in our code department here at [INSTITUTION 7:09] and that's how we've sort of taken hoarding and I've decided there's gotta be a better way to address the issue and that's when we got some training through [INSTITUTION 7:17] and [INSTITUTION 7:18].\n",
      "Interviewer: So for this last question, this is again kind of like a conceptual question for you, we've talked a lot throughout the interview about reasons that people give for their hoarding behavior, and I'm wondering if for you, just in your own thinking about this disorder, if those reasons are true motivators or if they're kind of post hoc justifications for an underlying, perhaps, biological need. So, another way of asking this question might be to say, which comes first, the behavior and then they justify it by saying, \"Oh the environment, oh I'm afraid of forgetting, oh I might use those\" or are the thoughts actually driving the behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that's a really good question. Of course that would be a great research question, I don't--yeah I think that's hard. I think that from what I've seen, people when they're acquiring or having difficulty discarding, it does seem to really ring true to their values of whatever those things are. So if it's someone who cares about the environment, it does seem like in the moment when we're doing an exposure, that that really is what's happening. That the act of discarding this will make the person feel anxiety and a part of that might also be that there's maybe a biological vulnerability or sensitivity, just like all anxiety disorders, and that learning component. So maybe I'm more vulnerable to feeling a need to acquire and also more vulnerable to want to keep things because I feel like I want to remember, maybe I'm more of a sentimental person. So there might be some distress associated with thinking about getting rid of something, and then as a solution there might be this avoiding discarding, right. Like, \"Oh I don't want to deal with that\" so maybe it's an anxiety sensitivity thing or an emotional sensitivity thing. Like, I just feel more distressed than the average person when I think about discarding these things, so I avoid doing it. And maybe there might be some post hoc reasoning or rationalizing of it after the fact, so it might be a combination of the two. I think there very well could be, although I think in a way it's almost like the avoidance behavior of discarding leads to all the clutter, it's just kind of a way that people might learn to cope with the distress that's associated with the need to discard, given just the environment. Like if someone had a huge home and all the money in the world, there wouldn't be as much of a need to go through and to discard things, and so that might be a different situation. But the fact is that most people do need to find things and have trouble finding things and so there might be behavioral reasons why people avoid or cope with that that kind of lead in the long term to this trap. You can avoid discarding things for a while, but ultimately if you think of a bathtub that doesn't have a drain, it's just eventually gonna overflow and then that's just going to become even more overwhelming. And so that behavior worked in the short-run, maybe they avoided feeling bad for a while, they avoided that distress and now we're in a situation that's maybe much worse. So in a way it's almost like, the way I look at or conceptualize it, the way I like to conceptualize all maladaptive behavioral responses to an emotional problem is just that it's a solution, for the moment, it's usually a short-term solution that someone comes up with, like it's either from anxiety like you'd see some avoidance behavior, you know, \"I'm just gonna avoid doing that or going to that place or looking through my items or discarding\" but that only provides short-term relief because at the end of the day, the distress is still there. The person still experiences distress when thinking about discarding, and then they haven't discarded for 20 years and now the problem is just so much worse that the distress is just exacerbated and increased. So that's the way I tend to conceptualize it, is that its their learned behavior based on that biological vulnerability or that biological kind of maybe anxiety sensitivity or emotion sensitivity as it relates to in this case hoarding, or acquisition and discarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well I really appreciate your time today, that's all the questions that I had.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I was asking if you have had the experience of having a really challenging diagnosis where you were't sure if something was truly hoarding or was either another mental health diagnosis or something else entirely. Have you ever had that experience, and can you think of an example of a time where you were really unsure if something was hoarding or wasn't?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah we had, just a quick one and then unfortunately I'm gonna have to run, I'm getting distracted because people are at my door [laughs], they keep coming back to my door every once in a while, so sorry about that. So, yeah I mean in one case there was a person who was, a lot of what they were collecting was like food wrappers and containers and so forth, and there were a lot of them in addition to other things, and it was hard to know whether it was hoarding or whether it was depression or if it was eating issues as well, and the way that at first the person was answering questions and based on conversation it seemed like they were having difficulty letting go of the papers and whatever the food came in, the containers and stuff. And then, but overtime, a pretty brief time, it became clear that actually it was the clutter that was attached to that and a number of other things that was really more related to the depression, and also some eating disorder issues as well. But you know, in terms of the specific items that they're holding onto and also in terms of how they were kind of answering the typical questions, it seemed it was hoarding but something kind of just didn't fully match, and so with more exploration and over time it became clear that the treatment specific for hoarding wasn't really a fit, it was more a need to address something in the mental health issues that were going on that were really more salient and the clutter was more secondary. So that's kind of just like a quick example of when it's come up, and sometimes it's kind of teasing it out of them as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well I want to be respectful, I appreciate your time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Awesome, well I'm really excited hear your answers for our questions, given how much experience you've had actually treating patients in patients' homes. So the first question that I'm gonna ask, so the first thing that we're gonna do is talk about what constitutes hoarding disorder, so to start off thinking about that, how would you describe the most important differences between normal saving behaviors, such as collecting perhaps, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, good question. So, I think the really big difference, there's a couple key differences I think, a lot of people collect and I think...I can't remember what year it was but I don't remember the percentage but there was a study done in the UK and it showed like 25% of the population engaged in collecting. So, obviously collecting is distinct from difficulties that are associated with hoarding disorder. I think one reason is that when someone's collecting, they tend to be able to organize their collection and kind of store their collection away, so if they're collecting stamps or what have you, they're kind of organized and they have a home and then these folks tend to bring up these collections and they tend to show them off with pride, there's joy associated with them like, \"look at these fans\" or maybe find other people who are interested in that particular item and they may show these items with joy and pride; whereas folks who are struggling with hoarding disorder tend to experience a lot of shame. There aren't, the items aren't necessarily organized in that neat, nice structured fashion and they're not necessarily showing others with pride. There's actually a lot of shame and distress associated with the items. I think that's a key difference, and those are the primary differences, now that I'm thinking about it actually. Like the way in which they're stored, folks with hoarding disorder don't have these items stored away so they can bring them out and show people, and the feelings associated with it. So, kind of the feeling of pride when someone's showing off their collection, versus somebody who is ashamed and has negative emotion around having all of these items in their home.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhmm\n",
      "Interviewee: So those are kind of the two primary.\n",
      "Interviewer: So there's another component about the DSM-IV that talks about difficulty discarding regardless of actual value, and I'm wondering if you've ever dealt with this as a component of wondering if somebody is an individual with hoarding disorder? So, does the value of the possessions that they're saving play into your thinking about this disorder? We tend to think of individuals with hoarding disorder as saving things that are objectively valueless or over-estimating the value of items, but could you have a person who has this disorder who saves things that are valuable?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, yeah that also is something...like I have clients who will only hoard brand-new item, like electronics, but they have the same feelings towards these objects even though they haven't used them, they have no immediate use for it, it's cluttering up you know. They can't use their kitchen because they have no many appliances, so I think it also depends on people's means and what they're actually hoarding. So, the items may not have little or no value, or they may have lot's of value. I think that's also suggestive to the individual and you know who working [INAUDIBLE 21:25] what they think is valuable or not.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, it sounds like for you the really crucial thing with individuals with this--and I like how you say this behavior, it sounds like it really comes down to the kind of attachment to objects, their emotional connection to object. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so it doesn't really matter what they're saving or how much they have because how much they have and what they're saving is kind of contextual, but if they have that strong sense of emotional connection to an object, that for you qualifies them as at least having behavior even if you can't technically give them the diagnosis. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right and maybe also with the decision-making. Like when I talk to people, when they have difficulties knowing what to recycle and what to put in the garbage and what's still usable and what isn't usable, that also can be an indication to me along with the attachment to the object and those emotional feelings towards the object, that can be telling to me about whether they have hoarding behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer: Another interesting diagnostic example that clinicians offered when we were talking about this criteria, and I'd love to hear what you think of this, is a patient that they treated who hoarded digital media so that their objects actually took up very little physical space, but the patient was incapable of ever deleting an email that they ever received or saved all of their browser history and was accumulating slowly hard drives filled with books on PDF and had tens of thousands of them and the physical space in their apartment actually was pretty small, but it was a similar sort of urge or a similar sort of distress with discarding and all of the justifications that the person gave for saving the digital media sounded like hoarding disorder. You know like, \"I'll read all of these books someday, I might need it sometime, I'm afraid I'll forget\" it didn't seem to sound like OCD but there were no physical objects in sight. So do you think that that would meet criteria for you?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, you know it would be...I've had similar cases, perhaps even a bit more extreme where there were multiple screens and a person was kind of unable to, they had to constantly kind of monitor things and then back in the day of VHS tapes and those kinds of things, the accumulation of that kind of technology, VCRs and things which generally speaking does take up quite a lot less space. In the absence of saving other objects, I'm not sure that that alone would meet criteria because it doesn't fully meet the criteria for the accumulation causing interference. For me, the times that I have seen that kind of digital accumulation, it's always also been in the context of saving of other items and/or animals, sadly. One case that I can think of, yeah so I don't think strictly it would been the criteria because it wouldn't meet that interference piece, but if it were in the context of other things, perhaps.\n",
      "Interview 026\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, perfect. Well thank you for doing that with me, we're going to move into the more unstructured fun part of the interview.

      "Interviewer: And are you involved in diagnosing people with hoarding disorder, treating them, or research or all of the above or none of the above?\n",
      "Interviewee: So we don't do diagnosis. We're less worried about the mental health diagnosis, our goal is to provide case management intervention so that people aren't losing their homes. And so, if you think about treatment more broadly and less kind of clinically, you know I guess you could make an argument that that what we're doing, that our focus is not on the mental health side, it's on the social service intervention side. In addition to that, we've partnered with [INSTITUTION 8:03] to do some research because we have a very large data base of information that we've collected over the years, to better understand the problem of hoarding as we see it in the community so that we can have a better response in terms of housing stability and eviction prevention.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how long have you worked with these individuals?\n",
      "Interviewee: Since 2006.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, now we're gonna talk a little bit about the diagnosis of hoarding and we have some questions, which we kind of use with clinicians but I'm really curious to your encounters with them and your ideas about them, so if you don't feel like these pertain particularly to you that's okay. The first one is kind of broad, so in your mind, what do you think are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps somebody who is a collector of items, and somebody with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Good question, I think there are a couple of different things. I think that the volume of possessions certainly is one. You know, with collectors, generally speaking they're able to display things, you could still use the homes and the rooms, the spaces for their intended purpose and I think when we think about hoarding, that impairment of the ability to use the space and the real risk of it in terms of health, safety and well-being is a bigger factor, so I think that that's the big kind of difference there that we see.\n",
      "Speaker: What’s it like, you know, whatever. An interview, I don’t know. I know when I first saw it go down that’s when I was like woah this is what we’re doing and then leaving and thinking that was so simple and so obvious. In some ways being like this is not going to do anything because of just how simple and obvious it was but then being immediately… given examples-seeing personal examples with my child but oh my God it totally worked. Its working and it’s totally useful. Because it did seem so simple, right why wouldn’t we face your fears and why wouldn’t we, you know. I think its almost sometimes giving the permission and the confidence that yes, this is what we’re going to do and it is going to be okay. You are going to be okay. That kind of thing because at first I was sort of like oh this is like I’m glad we didn’t sign up for block off two weeks of our lives to do this because at first I was like this is very basic and very simple. But it got quick results and I remember immediately just being like wow that’s pretty cool. Let’s see what’s next. Yup wow that was really cool too. Having my child feel the same way because the place of terror you’re coming from feels so all-encompassing and for something so simple to give you such relief and control is nice. I don’t know if there is any way to present that. I don’t know if that’s other people’s experiences, I certainly hope so.\n",
      "Interviewer: We’re glad that it’s your experience.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so presenting kind of like how that could… How it seems-\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah. What an exposure- what that might even, in a quick basic way showing kind of what the roles would be or what that might look like. A little-\n",
      "Interviewer: Would including information about parent’s roles and like what they can do to help, would that be beneficial as well?\n",
      "Speaker: I think, I mean I’m a parent so I think so but…\n",
      "Interviewer: Right. And so especially I’m guessing- well so would that be useful even if it was just one video or would that be better in a separate parent video?\n",
      "Speaker: In my mind I almost feel like you can do both in one but it would probably need to be longer than three minutes. I don’t know how your content would go but I feel like a kids one would be a little different than what a parent’s one would be. It would be more a little factual based whereas a kid one would be more experienced based. The role playing, like what it’s going to look like. Again you said you didn’t know if this was just going to be pediatrics right? The patients could also be adults.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: No. Sorry I may have misspoke. All the patients will be pediatric. The only thing we haven’t decided on what whether or not it would be one video or two separate ones.\n",
      "1:Speaker: I would think to separate ones.\n",
      "1:00:49: Interviewer: So do you think having two separate videos would be beneficial but in addition would you prefer to have one five minute video or two separate three minute.\n",
      "1:Speaker: I would make it longer. I mean it doesn’t even have to be 3 minutes just depending on how much content you have. You can probably keep kids for three minutes but you probably can’t keep adults that long. You would keep me that long.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: Good to know.\n",
      "1:Speaker: unless I got really sidetracked.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting, interesting, it sounds like in your clinical practice most of the patients you see have fairly good insight, is that correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, fairly good insight in that they're either aware that there's some issue, there's some desire to, there's something happening that's bothering the individual, whether it's, \"Oh I'm trying to get my taxes done and I have all these medical bills and in order to do that, I have to be able to sort through all my papers and discharge and I need to learn how to do that because there's so much distress associated with it right now.\" And so maybe there's not insight into all of the symptoms, or like a motivation to work on all of the domains in someone's life, but there might be in one area. So then we might work there and then we might work together to try to increase insight by just motivational interviewing type of technique. You know, I would never tell somebody that it's a problem, it's only a problem if it's a problem for that person, so it would just be highlighting some of the discrepancies that the individuals might bring up as related to the individual thinking its not a problem and just be kind of highlighting that it is a problem sometimes and having the person kind of sit with it not being a problem but it is a problem, like what does that mean? You know, and kind of talking to somebody to increase their insight would be something that we would do in therapy. But yeah, I think that on some level, most people that I see have some insight. The person that I worked with who had the least amount of insight, I think the reason the person was in treatment was because of the threat of evictions. Those are the hardest cases, because the person has absolutely no insight into the fact that the behavior is problematic and that there is probably distress and impairment in their life, you know there probably isn't going to be any reason to try to fix or do anything differently.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like the patients that you see, they start gaining insight because there's some area in their life where they see this negative consequence, even if they don't see the whole picture, there's an eviction, or they're trying to do their taxes, or there's one thing or another that they feel is having a negative impact. And then your tactic is kind of to start there and to see if you can spread that self-knowledge to other domains that are also impacted. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yup, yup, exactly. And I think the other thing that goes into that is because most people don't seek treatment until like their 50s or like midlife, that if you think about the outcome of these symptoms that happen early, I think that one of the reasons is that it takes years for things to accumulate. Like it takes years and years and years for a lot of these folks to actually acquire enough to actually compromise living space. So I think that by the time we're seeing folks things are pretty severe.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you ever feel that there is a borderline or a difficult with hoarding disorder in other co-morbid disorders? So, do you ever have difficulty telling if somebody is truly depressed or perhaps has a sense of compulsive disorder, versus they truly have hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I do see that but because I do treatment in the field, regardless of whatever they're struggling with, a lot of the treatment for the actual trouble with the items is the same. So, I'll be working with them, you know if they have other issues going on, you know working with their anxiety but then working with their hoarding problem the same way as I would with anybody.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you feel like there's maybe some overlap also that might make it difficult in conditions where the person is extremely impoverished or is saving things because they might actually need to sell them or they might be keeping them, you know, keeping things that people might normally not keep but because of the socioeconomic position the person's living in they're saving them? Or do you not have that difficulty?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I do have that difficulty but usually what I've found in the past is that'll be something the client will say, but when explored a little bit further, like you know, \"I have to keep this because I can't afford to get another one, or \"I can't afford to replace it if I need it, this other item that's similar will break,\" but often when I look at it further with them, it's more about like you know their difficulty with discarding, not because they need to hold onto some things for financial reasons. That's just kind of --\n",
      "Interviewer: It's a justification rather than a real thing.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah exactly, a justification. So, you know if you have 5 of something you only maybe need 2 of at the most, but that is a reason a lot of my clients use.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay. Another thing that has come out in these interviews has to do with the diagnostic criteria that reads, \"The difficulty discarding results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.\" And that seems to be what you're talking about in terms of the space kind of impairing the person's life. I'm wondering how you think about, and I'm sure this is something that you encounter, the fact that if you have less space, if you're living in a very small apartment for instance, it's much easier for your space to become congested and cluttered as opposed to somebody who lives in a huge mansion who has plenty of space, or somebody who can afford storage units. Do you feel like it's easier for a person who has a small apartment to have hoarding disorder, or do you feel like that doesn't really play out that way?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think people with hoarding disorder are going to fill the available space. We often hear, \"Oh if I just had a bigger space,\" but then we see people who have 3-bedroom apartments or 2-bedroom apartments and they're full. And so I think it's less about apartment size and more about the ability to separate out the emotional attachment and also separate out the limits, because we all have to live with the space that we've got.\n",
      "Interviewer: Would it be hypothetically possible to hoard items that don't take up space, such as somebody who has like thousands of digital books on their computer and has no more hard drive space and can't use their computer because they have--you know, I guess what I'm asking about is does it have to be space in the home? Is that a necessary part of it?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, I think at least for right now, yes. You know, I could certainly see an argument about hoarding elsewhere, but that's where really the question becomes in what way is it impairing the individual's functioning in whatever part of their life? Because without that impairment I don't really see how that's a disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: So for you that comes back to impairment, and I guess when you're talking about impairment, how do you determine...so again, I could imagine a person making an argument that their kitchen use is not impaired because they don't cook, they don't use their stove, so the fact that they have huge piles of stuff on their stove isn't impairing to them because they would never use their stove anyway. So, when you're trying to determine if somebody is truly impaired, particularly in a disorder like this where people sometimes struggle with seeing the impairment, how do you make that determination?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that's where we have to look at, you know, there are a lot of different kinds of impairment. So, if somebody's not cooking but they've still got items on their stove, that's a fire hazard that could impair their health and safety if there were to be a fire. So just given what we know about how long it takes to intervene in hoarding-related fires, and so I think that people with hoarding may look very narrowly at impairment, while we're looking much more broadly at is this impacting your ability to carry out daily life activities? Is it impacting your ability to remain safely housed? Is it impacting your health and wellbeing overall in ways that the person might not necessarily see, given the disabling nature of hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: I was just gonna follow up and ask you about animal hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewee: People who hoard animals have this very strong delusional belief, you know, they can be standing in four feet of feces among carcasses of animals and tell you that they're the only person to provide good care. And so I think it is on a continuum and when I think only about object hoarding, I would say that yes I would agree with you that it probably tends towards something less in touch with reality, though my clinical experience of it is I've never actually had to think in my mind, \"Oh is this person not in touch with reality?\" What it is is such a deeply held belief, it is the definition of a core belief in my mind because it is just this belief that, \"because I own this pen, it is worth more than you will ever understand, it is worth more than any other pen like it in the store, it is because it is mine and it has been with me on this journey.\" So, that's the flavor of it much more so than a dissociated reality, at least to my experience. Sorry, one caveat though I would say is the saving of bizarre items that we see in the smaller percentage of hoarding that overlaps with OCD. Sometimes that overvalued ideation takes a bit more of an out of touch feeling around the bizarre items, but I would say that's the exception and not the rule.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you think about the reasons people give, which we made a list of at the beginning, the reasons that they save items. So, those may be related that core belief and maybe even including it, when you think about hoarding disorder, do you feel like the reasons you gave like it's sentimental, it might help me to not forget things, you know those sorts of reasons, do you feel like they are truly driving the disorder? Or do you feel like they're kind of post-hoc justifications that the patient has for kind of an underlying essential biological need to save things, and then they just kind of...they save it, they need to save it, and then when you ask them why, they kind of generate a justification for it?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um...no, it is my belief that as an anxiety-based disorder that the saving that is happening and the justification for the saving is based in fear and worry, and it is the excessive fear and worry that leads to the thinking that is reinforced both with the accompanying strong emotion. So they have this fear and then all of the accompanying emotions alongside the fear about what will happen if I don't have this object, and what leads me to say that is when I hear these justifications from clients, it's often accompanied by a clear articulation of a very bad thing that would happen to them or to someone that they loved, ranging from some bodily harm to something akin to some kind of disaster. So, it feels to me not like a justification, it seems that it is this primal urge that is driven by fear and fear's powerful, right? And sometimes it's there for good reasons, but in other cases it is not justified, and I think that's where things get confused for people with hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it's more about the home use itself and whether the person's space usage is impaired?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah that's a big part of it, and you know I think the emotional attachment is different. I think for people with hoarding based on our experience, there's a lot of worry about what happens to the items if they're not being used, there's a lot of worry about the person collecting the items, their individual emotional and physical well-being if they didn't have the items, and so I think that that's also distinct form what you would see from a collector. It's a much more personalized attachment.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like there's two kind of main distinguishing factors for you. One is that unlike collecting, in individual with hoarding disorder's space will be kind of difficult or dangerous to use. And then the second one is that they'll have a much more kind of intense, maybe fear-based emotional response to their item? Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, along with, you know not just fear-based, but an inability to separate out their identity, potential identity, all of those kind of emotions from the physical objects themselves.\n",
      "Interviewer: And have you ever encountered a person where you were unsure if they truly had hoarding disorder? Maybe a borderline case or a case that wasn't a usual, where you felt like you just weren't sure or you struggled whether this was what was really going on for the person?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, not really. I mean, most of our cases are pretty straight-forward in terms of, you know, when people are talking about their stuff or what they worry about if they did get rid of their stuff, that in combination with the sheer volume of possessions that we see. I can't think of a case where we were unclear. Certainly where we do run into issues is, and this is very different from looking at things clinically obviously, but we have folks who have other mental health issues such as schizophrenia or something like that. So sometimes for us, we're addressing the hoarding behaviors because that's what we're there for, but sometimes it's not clear, is the other mental health issue the primary factor, or is it the hoarding? And I think that's where it gets tricky and it's very different than how this would be clinically diagnosed.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how do you deal with those situations?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, in a lot of the situations we'll do more behavioral work, you know, we've got a partnership with our department of mental health, we work with a lot of their more challenging individuals who will do a lot of things like using blue painter's tape to create an egress path and working with the individuals to get them used to keeping that egress path clear and then reducing the height of piles and getting them used to doing that by using other visual cues. And so, we're much less focused in those situations on the cognitive side and are really primarily focused on using harm-reduction and the behavioral side of things.\n",
      "Interviewer: Now I'd like to talk more specifically about the DSM-IV criteria themselves. Thinking about the diagnosis of hoarding and the criteria for the diagnosis of hoarding, are there any particular elements that kind of off the top of your head you think of as particularly difficult to apply or that different clinicians might apply differently or might be particularly subjective?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I think that the DSM-IV doesn't really take into account other settings. Like, you may see hoarding disorder or hoarding behavior, so I have to often...even though somebody had hoarding behaviors in the community but no one ever really diagnosed them, and if they come into a care setting like a long-term care setting or a hospital, they're still having that hoarding behavior and the difficulty discarding, but they wouldn't meet the criteria because their space isn't cluttered because they're living in a care home, but they still would have hoarding disorder. So, I think there's a lack of looking at the [INAUDIBLE 17:22] spaces with the diagnosis. So, I think people could still have hoarding disorder or difficulties, like same symptoms without being assessed as having the actual disorder. And you know, for many services you have to be diagnosed with something in order to meet the criteria for service, so that's unfortunate. I also think there's a lack of practitioners that can diagnose and feel comfortable diagnosing it. Like in the area where I live there's nobody working with hoarding disorder, there's no psychiatrists or psychologists working with hoarding disorder that have any sort of understanding or experience. So, clients can't see somebody that can diagnose them with something because of the lack of experience with professionals. I have no idea if I answered your whole question [laughs].\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, no you totally did. It sounds like particularly you're talking about the part of the DSM-IV that says, \"The difficulty discarding possessions results the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use,\" and it sounds like your problem with this is that people sometimes don't have control over their spaces, and so their active living areas aren't technically compromised and so they don't meet this criteria and so then they don't get the diagnosis, even though they exhibit all of the behaviors and ideation that go along with hoarding disorder. Does that seem right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, that's right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah I mean that is a question that I have about the DSM-IV as well and I was gonna ask you in particular, in situations like this how you make a judgement about whether you would consider them a person with hoarding disorder when this criteria isn't met, and it sounds like what you're saying is for you this criteria isn't a deal breaker. That they might not have congested and cluttered active living areas, but that they still might be a person with hoarding disorder. Does that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, exactly. So, you know if they have the difficulty discarding, trouble with decision-making, all the other things, I think that they still may have hoarding disorder but because we can't get a diagnosis I kind of differentiate hoarding behavior and hoarding disorder because we can't have a diagnosis, but I see this often in my work.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so that's kind of along the lines of what I was going to ask you about. How do you distinguish between chronically progressive and kind of the normal sort of social life events, which happen to many people? Like your parents die and leave you a bunch of stuff, your children leave home and so you're now alone in the house, your marriage ends or your spouse dies and so you're more isolated? And do you as a clinician think that it's related to things like dementia, and therefore related to aging, and therefore that's why we see it as more prevalent in older adults? Or do you see it as progressive in more of a kind of social sense in the sense that people tend to have more items and be more isolated as they age?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think the demential piece is again an area that's really understudied and not well understood. I think anything that we have is, you know we have a few good studies but it's mostly hypothesis at this point. I think for me the normal life events against a back trap, again all of those vulnerabilities, against a back trap of those genetic predispositions for this and neurobiological features and factors that are brought to life means that certainly it can be present for a long time before it reaches the flashpoint, or it might be a slow...you know, the snowball rolling down the hill that gains this momentum and size as it goes. And I think we don't fully understand any of that yet, I think clinically the most important thing that we can do as part of our assessment is to take that decade by decade like history and really try to understand what were the best vulnerabilities for developing this problem. You know, if we can get approximate age of onset and then what does the chronicity look like and then what were the periods of worsening course, I think that would give us our best bet for hopefully someday earlier intervention and maybe prevention work, but we're such a long way from that.\n",
      " Interview V\n",
      " Interviewer: Can you hear me okay?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, that's the last little list we have for you, and now I'd like to get into the more kind of conversational portion of our interview. Could you just begin by giving me a brief overview in terms of your background related to hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure, so for the past nine years, I have worked in a community agency doing individual group treatments for hoarding disorder. I also work in a care facility and am currently doing research and treatment and on creating an assessment to care planning method for hoarding disorder in care settings. I also work as a clinical social worker doing private practice, individual or family work with people with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, and your educational background?\n",
      "Interviewee: I have a master's in social work and a bachelor's in psychology.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Okay, so the first thing I'd like to talk to you about in this interview is about how you distinguish hoarding disorder from other kind of behaviors that are more on the spectrum of normalcy and how you diagnose it? Do you diagnose people with hoarding disorder clinically?\n",
      "Interviewee: No.\n",
      "24:42 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so I know that you mentioned that your husband and yourself, that you collect coins. So would you say that this is an example of a normal saving behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes. 24:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it’s just more orderly, you know what you have.\n",
      "2Participant:\n",
      "And they’re stored together, organized.\n",
      "25:02 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so organization is definitely a big thing.\n",
      "2Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, you’re not going to trip over them!\n",
      "25:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so I know I asked you how you can tell if someone has hoarding disorder in the beginning. So you mentioned that it’s messy and they have trouble getting rid of things, so how is that the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think it’s the same. I mean, I have trouble getting rid of things for whatever reason, and it’s a big mess, and it’s very apparent, and it’s in the way of, you know, life here, and it’s pissing people off.\n",
      "25:58 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so do you think there’s a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder or issues with clutter without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s a good question. 26:11 Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Perhaps, I mean I carry like a little fanny pack as my purse, and it’s usually stuffed. Although, I don’t have a problem emptying out the garbage and that sort of stuff periodically from it. So I don’t know if you could infer that if somebody has… you know… a purse stuffed with stuff… I don’t know!\n",
      "26:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "I don’t know either, but I know it’s a female’s prerogative to carry a purse, so.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You would think that a person who has hoarding disorder, their car would be disorganized. It’s full of trash and all this stuff.\n",
      "26:56 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so their car could be a way to tip someone off that someone may have hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It could be, but if you look at my car, it’s fine. I don’t keep crap in it that shouldn't be there, and I don’t pile trash in there either, so.\n",
      "27:13 Interviewer:\n",
      "So compared to your house, your car is less cluttered then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "For sure, yes. 27:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Maybe online or I like to watch a lot of medical or such type programs on TV.\n",
      "27:39 Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you give me a couple of examples of these shows that you watch?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I don’t watch, maybe because it’s painful! There’s this show I think called “Hoarding” or “The Hoarders” or something like that.\n",
      "27:52 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, I think I’ve heard of that one.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, and I’ve watched one or two of those, and, you know, you would think I’m a hoarder from watching that. Although, we can mostly [28:07] INCOHERENT in this one room!\n",
      "28:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "So would you say compared to the extreme cases on those shows, would you have less clutter than them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: So there's a whole conversation I'd like to have with you about insight and what exactly that means, and I'm not sure we're gonna have time for it today but it sounds like what you're saying is that a lot of times it may seem like an individual doesn't have insight because they're not admitting that they have a problem, but they may actually be more aware of their problem but just be unable to admit it because admitting it would kind of seem to push them to take some kind of action or to be judged somehow. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and some people don't necessarily want mental health treatment, you know like in the case of I want to hold onto my housing. You know, \"I'm not necessarily interested in mental health treatment, I want to hold onto my housing.\" So, that's very different from somebody who's in mental health care already in addressing the issue of insight. I guess when I'm thinking of insight I'm thinking around the DSM specifically, so I'm thinking about how do people kind of what do they say in terms of what do they recognize in terms of labeling and what accounts perhaps for that as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think the other things is that, so there's comorbidity that come out with hoarding around depression, around OCD and so forth and I think that sometimes there's confusion in the field around that in terms of what is what. People are so focused on the clutter, what's secondary to... what's actually hoarding and what is secondary to other mental health or physical health problem. The other thing that comes up is issues around trauma, so how does trauma kind of fit in. So, you know, some of the comorbidity research shows that there's a low rate of PTSD. Folks I've met with will talk about a traumatic event, it doesn't mean that it's PTSD and there's some myths out there that trauma causes hoarding and the research doesn't really support that. So I think that can affect the diagnosing a bit and the issues around the criteria a bit in terms of the role of trauma.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you think of a challenging case where you were unsure if something was truly hoarding disorder or either another mental health disorder or something that's on the spectrum of hoarding behavior? Have you ever had that experience with a person who potentially had hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think it depends sometimes on what our role is, right. So we talk about this in training a bit, we'll show people a picture and they're sure it's hoarding [laughs]. They're sure it's squalor and hoarding, and just because it looks like that in terms of clutter doesn't mean it's specific to the DSM criteria around hoarding, right. So, there could be a lot of reasons that there could be squalor or clutter in their environment that may not be specifically hoarding. Can you repeat your question again?\n",
      "Interviewer: Going briefly back to other people, I know that you said you know other people that have gone through CBT. Do you know if their experience was a positive one? Negative?\n",
      "Speaker: I know one person who tried it, and he didn’t really give it enough time. It was a relative, and it was pretty exciting when I heard about it, but it was something that he didn’t try for very long. These things take time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah that’s kind of going with what you said earlier, right? It’s not necessarily a quick fix. It’s going to take some time.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah. Probably not going in once and done kind of a thing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, definitely. Could you tell me a little bit about the... you touched on this a little briefly… about challenging negative thoughts… what are some other areas that CBT targets? What skills do you develop from it?\n",
      "Speaker: Not just challenging negative thoughts, but also, I think was part of it, recognizing maybe when you are more, I think anxiety… when you are feeling moments of anxiety, if you can recognize that, then you can draw from things you learned in CBT to help you manage it better.\n",
      "Interviewer: So a little bit like a toolkit.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yeah. Or almost like exercising a little bit, build up your strength.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right. What was the role of feelings in CBT, would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: Feelings, emotions… I don’t know… I’m not sure about that.\n",
      "Interviewer: How about like behaviors or actions?\n",
      "Speaker: Behaviors is probably more like to, you react- you behave in a certain way. Maybe you’re in a crowd and you don’t want to participate or whatever the situation is, maybe in that type of therapy you might learn to recognize that those situations are not… recognize what’s happening in the situation and realize it’s something you can improve or change.\n",
      "TRANSCRIPTION PAUSED\n",
      "Interviewer: Cool. Awesome. So I’m just going to turn to more of the video side of things. So thinking about these videos there’s kind of a twofold thing, where on one hand they want to make videos for kids, but we’re also contemplating the use of creating videos for parents. So when you answer these questions, feel free to think about both sides of things, like what you think would be useful. So, first in terms of the who: if we’re making videos like this, who do you think should be starring in these videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Who would be starring in the videos… let’s see… I see a lot of those animals here. I never thought about that. We tend to see things like putting famous people on lately and doing little video bits that you see on TV for mental health… spokespersons. Sometimes I think that helps because it helps bring those topics out and make them seem a little more normal. I’ve also seen videos where they use maybe people who had gone through the therapy, and as a result of that had improved. Those were also good so they can explain how it helped them. I don’t know if you’re thinking about live action videos…\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, yeah! It’s something we’ll get to.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah or animation or cartoons is what we started on here, and so maybe different as an adult, I’d probably relate to the non-cartoons better, but I’d think children could relate to better to something like a cartoon.\n",
      "Interviewer: Looking at the characters, so what would you say would be important for the parent? [11:42]____\n",
      "Speaker: From a parent, we’re looking for answers. We’re looking for ways to help our children. And from a parent’s perspective, a video, they might relate more to adult type characters, and maybe they’ll relate to how they’ll help their family or help them.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you see clients, how much insight would you say most people have by the time you see them?\n",
      "Interviewee: It depends on how they're being referred to me. So, you know I often get family members that will ask me to go and talk to their family member with them, kind of like an intervention or going in to assess. The city might ask me to go in and assess, so it depends if the client is asking to see help or agreeing with seeking help, or not. So, if the client is agreeing, they usually have some level of insight. Usually they can't understand all of how their behaviors are contributing to their anxiety or depression or whatever, or how much of a safety risk it is, but they have an idea that they have an issue, but if somebody else is referring them they usually have some insight that they have more stuff than other people, but they don't know why other people are bothered by it. SO, it kind of depends on how they come to me. And I often find clients who have a lot of stuff and are having difficulty, they have some insight. Like, a lot of times I know research says that they don't, but I find that they do understand that their living spaces do not fit other living spaces. Or how society deems them to have certain living spaces, that's why they're not letting people into their home, because they know they're going to be judged based on their living space. They may not understand fully, but they have some insight.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, it sounds like you're almost drawing a distinction here between two different kind of levels or kinds of insight. So, it sounds like you're saying that most people are aware that they have more space than average, or they have more stuff than average, and to some extent are aware that there's stigma around having this much stuff or that other people might not get it. And then there's kind of the second level, which is recognizing that having so much stuff is causing them distress, or causing their life to have--having negative impacts on their lives. And it sounds like you're saying the first kind of insight, recognizing the behavior as abnormal is pretty common, and then the second level of insight, recognizing the behavior as kind of contributing to difficulties in their life, is less common or more difficult to achieve. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I think so yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when patients do kind of self-refer or come to you with awareness of the fact that this is a problem in their lives, do you have any kind of knowledge of how they have reached that conclusion on their own? Like what has happened in their life typically to help them to get there?\n",
      "Interviewee: Usually it's causing relationship issues, so either with someone in their immediate family or a friend or family members worry about them or they're kind of bugging them to get help, or it could be like they're gonna get evicted, so outside factors usually forcing them to get help. Or they have, you know, they want to have their grandchildren over and their children are telling them it's not safe. So, there's usually an outside influence. I find my clients are generally fine living the way they are until something else, another factor's involved. Or maybe, you know, if they can't shower and they're constantly going to the hospital for skin sheets.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay. Another thing that has come out in these interviews has to do with the diagnostic criteria that reads, \"The difficulty discarding results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.\" And that seems to be what you're talking about in terms of the space kind of impairing the person's life. I'm wondering how you think about, and I'm sure this is something that you encounter, the fact that if you have less space, if you're living in a very small apartment for instance, it's much easier for your space to become congested and cluttered as opposed to somebody who lives in a huge mansion who has plenty of space, or somebody who can afford storage units. Do you feel like it's easier for a person who has a small apartment to have hoarding disorder, or do you feel like that doesn't really play out that way?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think people with hoarding disorder are going to fill the available space. We often hear, \"Oh if I just had a bigger space,\" but then we see people who have 3-bedroom apartments or 2-bedroom apartments and they're full. And so I think it's less about apartment size and more about the ability to separate out the emotional attachment and also separate out the limits, because we all have to live with the space that we've got.\n",
      "Interviewer: Would it be hypothetically possible to hoard items that don't take up space, such as somebody who has like thousands of digital books on their computer and has no more hard drive space and can't use their computer because they have--you know, I guess what I'm asking about is does it have to be space in the home? Is that a necessary part of it?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, I think at least for right now, yes. You know, I could certainly see an argument about hoarding elsewhere, but that's where really the question becomes in what way is it impairing the individual's functioning in whatever part of their life? Because without that impairment I don't really see how that's a disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: So for you that comes back to impairment, and I guess when you're talking about impairment, how do you determine...so again, I could imagine a person making an argument that their kitchen use is not impaired because they don't cook, they don't use their stove, so the fact that they have huge piles of stuff on their stove isn't impairing to them because they would never use their stove anyway. So, when you're trying to determine if somebody is truly impaired, particularly in a disorder like this where people sometimes struggle with seeing the impairment, how do you make that determination?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that's where we have to look at, you know, there are a lot of different kinds of impairment. So, if somebody's not cooking but they've still got items on their stove, that's a fire hazard that could impair their health and safety if there were to be a fire. So just given what we know about how long it takes to intervene in hoarding-related fires, and so I think that people with hoarding may look very narrowly at impairment, while we're looking much more broadly at is this impacting your ability to carry out daily life activities? Is it impacting your ability to remain safely housed? Is it impacting your health and wellbeing overall in ways that the person might not necessarily see, given the disabling nature of hoarding.\n",
      "Interview 023\n",
      "Interviewer: So that's the last list that I have for you. How are we doing on time, do you have to run?\n",
      "Interviewee: I'm okay, I sent actually an email just to say that I'm gonna be a few minutes late so if it's 10 minutes more I'll be okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so let's have you tell me a little bit about your background just very briefly in terms of your training and how you see individuals with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure, so I'm a trained psychologist and social worker and I came to my work with hoarding actually through work with OCD first and then began working more with people with hoarding over time. I think based on my earlier experiences, some people found it very frustrating to work with people with hoarding, I more challenging but fascinating as well. So I kind of move in that direction and was much more [INAUDIBLE 19:29] kind of behavioral therapy training or ERP to start with back in the day before [INAUDIBLE 19:39] and Randy Frost developed more specialized treatment and kind of moved more into that model. And then I've kind of expanded into multiple models in terms of thinking about various domains and working in housing and public health and other areas as well. So, have kind of like expanded out in that, but definitely come from a mental health background in terms of training.\n",
      "Interviewer: So now I'd like to talk to you about the ways that you diagnose hoarding disorder, and specifically about the DSM-IV criteria. Please cut us off when you have to go and I'll follow up over email, and if we can find another time that's great, but I want to get as far as we can get but let me know when you're out of time, okay?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, no problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So, thinking about the DSM-IV criteria specifically, are there any aspect of the DSM-IV specifically off the top of your head that you regard as kind of difficult to apply or that you thought perhaps rely on clinical judgement or that you worry that different clinicians might apply differently?\n",
      "Interviewee: That's a good question, I think the fact that acquisition is a specifier as opposed to one of the core criteria can potentially be, it's not difficult to use but at the same time I think that could be confusing to some in terms of how to apply it, especially in the community in terms of using it as opposed to kind of research focused. And also I think in terms of insight, where sometimes there's some confusion in terms of where some clients feel pushed against the wall so they'll seem reluctant or seem like they're not recognizing what the issue is, but there's a lot of shame and other experiences that they've had, so it's not really that they totally lack insight, but to actually...I don't want to say admit a problem but to like speak to it a certain way makes them feel like they're gonna have to comply with their things and it's scary in terms of having, what are their rights in that scenario or the dynamics of the family and so forth as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, and it sounds like the conversation we were just having about people with object hoarding behaviors and being able to see the problem in some level, do you feel like that's different with individuals with animal hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, well I don't have enough experience but in my experience I feel like people with animal hoarding, they don't really have the insight into the...you know, they do have a lot of love and care--many of them do, I know there's different types of animal hoarding but many of them do love and care for the animals, but they cannot see that they're not caring for the animals properly.\n",
      "Interviewer: So that maybe is a true blindness almost rising to the level of delusion?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Kind of the end of the interview but just to kind of finish up with some broad questions about your thinking about these kinds of problems, at the beginning of the interview I asked you to generate a list of reasons that people with hoarding problems tend to give to justify their behavior, and I wonder if kind of thinking abstractly, do you think that these reasons that they give are kind of what's driving the behavior? Or do you think that the behavior is what's coming first, and the reasons that people give are kind of post-hoc explanations for a compulsive behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think a lot of times the explanation for the behavior, because they're being asked why you're doing it. Yeah, they do kind of justify the behavior coming up with whatever they can to justify why they keep something or why they're doing something, rather than that's actually the reason why they're doing it. Because I can ask somebody the same question about why they're keeping this one day, and then the next day they'll give me a completely different answer.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it seems like they're saving it and then maybe when they're questioned as to why they're saving it, they're coming up with a reason.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think it could be different in different people, but it my experience most of the time, they'll say a reason why they're saving it and then I will kind of refuse that and say \"well there has to be more,\" and then they'll come up with another reason. So, I don't think that the reason for actually saving that they're giving me is the reason why they're saving it.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, the behavior is kind of driving the justification.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, I'm gonna start by asking you kind of broad questions, and then I'd like to ask you a little bit about the specific DNS-IV criteria, although I know you don't necessarily use them in diagnosis, I assume you're really familiar with them. Is that correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Just to begin with as a broad first question, for you what are the most important differences between things that are on the spectrum of normal saving behavior, even thinking about something like extreme collecting, and hoarding disorder? How do you differentiate?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, so it would be the...like the emotional attachment to the item, usually people that have just collecting behaviors don't feel that emotional connection to the object, they look at the object differently. So, generally when people want to get rid of something, if they don't have hoarding disorder they can get rid of it with little help or a little bit of time. People with hoarding disorder will get extreme amounts of anxiety when they think about or try to discard something. So, that's the biggest difference is the emotional attachment and the feelings regarding the item.\n",
      "Interviewer: Is there a different in terms of--\n",
      "Interviewee: And it's also--sorry. A lot of times it's not just one type of item. Like with collectors, collectors will collect like certain things but people with hoarding disorder will usually, it'll be random items. So, it could be different types of items, not just one type.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, it sounds like individuals who are collectors will not have the same degree of emotional attachment and will not have the same kind of emotional reaction to discarding, whereas individuals with hoarding disorder have a strong emotional attachment and also individuals with hoarding disorder tend not to gravitate to certain kinds of items, they tend to be more indiscriminate.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you ever encountered an individual that you felt was a borderline case, or somebody who you were kind of not sure about whether they would fit this diagnosis or not, and can you tell me a little bit about a case like that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so I [INAUDIBLE 12:33] mostly because families are involved or because of the space. You know, a lot of my clients don't actually meet clinical diagnosis, or wouldn't meet a clinical diagnosis because they may live in a facility that has certain rules or certain guidelines, or they may live with their family members or have been working on their hoarding disorder for long periods of time, but they still have the emotional attachment to objects and they still have the anxiety and the difficulty discarding and trouble with organization, so they still have all of the trouble that goes along with the hoarding disorder, but their space may not meet the diagnosis. So, you know, it may not be significantly cluttered to the point that they can't use certain spaces in their home, but they still have the difficulties discarding and you know, they may have acquiring issues but they may still be managing it. So, they may still be suffering from the symptoms of hoarding disorder, but not actually meet a diagnosis. So, I will get clients like that often.\n",
      "Interviewer: And have you ever encountered a person where you were unsure if they truly had hoarding disorder? Maybe a borderline case or a case that wasn't a usual, where you felt like you just weren't sure or you struggled whether this was what was really going on for the person?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, not really. I mean, most of our cases are pretty straight-forward in terms of, you know, when people are talking about their stuff or what they worry about if they did get rid of their stuff, that in combination with the sheer volume of possessions that we see. I can't think of a case where we were unclear. Certainly where we do run into issues is, and this is very different from looking at things clinically obviously, but we have folks who have other mental health issues such as schizophrenia or something like that. So sometimes for us, we're addressing the hoarding behaviors because that's what we're there for, but sometimes it's not clear, is the other mental health issue the primary factor, or is it the hoarding? And I think that's where it gets tricky and it's very different than how this would be clinically diagnosed.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how do you deal with those situations?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, in a lot of the situations we'll do more behavioral work, you know, we've got a partnership with our department of mental health, we work with a lot of their more challenging individuals who will do a lot of things like using blue painter's tape to create an egress path and working with the individuals to get them used to keeping that egress path clear and then reducing the height of piles and getting them used to doing that by using other visual cues. And so, we're much less focused in those situations on the cognitive side and are really primarily focused on using harm-reduction and the behavioral side of things.\n",
      "Interviewer: And it sounds like maybe unlike a typical clinician, for you what's really important is making the person safe to live in the home and what's causing the behavior is almost less important than that. I mean if they have, for instance, obsessive compulsive disorder other than hoarding, if their house is full of stuff for you the primary thing to deal with is the house. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Correct, you know and doing the work to teach them the skills so that they can maintain it moving forward. We have a very low recidivism rate because our approach is regardless of what might be going on, if there is a different diagnosis that would be clinically given, that's less what we're worried about. We're really worried about teaching them the skills so that they can not only reduce the volume of their housing, but maintain it moving forward.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Um, so one of the difficulties with this disorder in the long literature, and I'm sure you encounter it in your work and in your life all the time, is the problem of insight and one of the diagnostic criteria reads, \"The difficulty discarding is due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discarding,\" and I'm wondering how you think about distress in this context, when people will often deny that they are distressed by kind of the state of their home and they may also deny that they would be distressed if they had to discard their items? So how do you think about that? How do you think about the way that that distress fits into this diagnosis?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, when we're talking about most of our clients don't have a whole lot of insight, right, so they're like \"no everything's fine.\" You know, what we often try to do is get them talking about the way the stuff isn't actually working for them, whether it's about housing or they can't find their remote or they're tripping. And so, for us often the distress is apparent even if it's not apparent to them and so a lot of time our work is really focused on how do we get them talking about the ways that maybe things aren't going as well as they are telling themselves they are because to some degree I think that saying that everything's really okay it's not a big deal is a great way to have to avoid the reality that maybe things actually aren't as good are they are, or as they seem. And so, I think that that for us a lot of times it's we see the distress and we see the impairment in functioning whether it's distress by the individual or someone else and so a lot of times for us it's really having the conversation and getting them to articulate how stuff's not working so well--even if we're doing it in a way that's not directly saying, \"well I don't think this is working so well.\" It's really kind of saying, \"you know it sounds like on the one hand stuff is feeling great, and on the other hand you lost your keys or you can't find your medication\" or kind of tell them more about the ways this stuff isn't going the way you'd like it to.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like a major task for you, with a person with hoarding disorder, is helping them to experience or to see their own distress.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, kind of to turn the conversation towards that problem with insight, how do you define insight or low insight in this context? What does having insight mean for a person with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know like with everything else, I think that depends on the person. Sometimes it can be understanding that they've got the problem and why that may be, sometimes significant change in insight for someone might be acknowledging that they can see why another person might see and issue, even if they are not ready to admit it but they're ready to do something to at least start making somebody else happy and then kind of finding their own ways. You know, so a lot of our work is getting people to go from \"there's no problem, why is everybody picking on me?\" To \"okay well maybe there's an issue.\"\n",
      "Interviewer: And I want to be respectful of your time, so if you have to go at any point please just let me know, I'm pretty much at my last question. So, when you typically encounter hoarders, how long do they say that their behavior has been going on?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well...I mean the, I was part of the clinical trial, I was a study therapist on the [INAUDIBLE 1:08:27] trial, from which the data emerged that people begin saving and [INAUDIBLE 1:08:35]. And so I treated a whole pile of people who described this behavior starting, you know, around 13, 14, 15 years old and just having what we clinically describe as a chronic and worsening course. I would say that's the vast majority of the people that I've treated, and if not in their teens certainly by their late teens and early twenties they have some awareness that it was causing impairment as they were at college or beginning to live autonomously away from their families of origin. And the piece that's very interesting to me over and over again is that yeah there were all these pre-disposing sort of bits that were there from childhood, and then there are these real markers of things, moments in life where things got much worse and then it plateaued, and then there was this other thing and oh yeah it got much worse again; so, sort of these flashpoint, if you will. I will say I've also treated a handful of people who've described a much, not much but a couple of decades later onset of the problem. So, they sort of mark the beginnings in their 30s and 40s, much later than the typical age of onset, and because it has a chronic and worsening course, you know we see a whole pile of it, especially involuntary clients, in older adults years. But most of the people, and I don't work primarily with older adults, I'm sometimes called in to consul on those cases, but I think that the idea that it just doesn't get better without intervention, and because it is a problem that primarily occurs behind closed doors and homes and until very recently and in most cases we are still doing a terrible job of assessing for this in an outpatient way. You know, you go to the doctor and nobody's asking you if there's clutter in your home or if you can use the rooms in your home for the purpose intended, and so it can remain this very hidden problem. And because of the shame and stigma, people become more and more isolated in the problem. And so I think, unless they actually ask for help or come forwards, figuring out the progression of this is very tricky business.\n",
      "Interviewer: Seeing that we’re talking about creating educational videos, well first before I even show you the different layouts we have of different themes, we wanted to know, based off your thoughts or opinions, we need to decide who will be in the videos. So what characters do you think we should include in the videos? Should there be any nonhuman characters such as animals, superheroes, or even children? Should we include a boy or girl? So, just getting a good handle of what you believe, as far as character wise, of what should be in the videos.\n",
      "Speaker: I would stick with people versus animals or characters.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so superheroes would be….? Is that people?\n",
      "Speaker: I would just do regular people. Personally, but I’m not a professional so I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: No it’s all about your… we just want to gather information so there’s no right or wrong answer.\n",
      "Speaker: Just people. Anybody can relate to people.\n",
      "Interviewer: People. Okay so when you say people, are we talking about children, parents, friends, doctors?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, like the doctor, the parents, the patient itself- the child.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so you’re thinking patient, doctor, parents, and families.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah… the office and staff.\n",
      "Interviewer: Should we include a boy or girl? Both?\n",
      "Speaker: Either. Both.\n",
      "Interviewer: Either/ or okay. So now that we have an idea of the characters you’d want and some of the videos we’d develop, we need to decide where they talk, so what kind of setting? Would it be home or school, doctor’s office kind of setting, or maybe outside at the park? Which one of those do you think? Or maybe a combination of those?\n",
      "Speaker: I would say probably home and office.\n",
      "Interviewer: Home and office. The doctor’s office?\n",
      "Speaker: Depending upon the part or what viewpoint is coming across. Like, whatever setting it happens in.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, and why is that that you’re thinking of the home and doctor’s office?\n",
      "Speaker: Just because that’s where it typically would be discussed in the first place.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So it’s familiar is what you’re saying?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, like a doctor sent us to therapy, or we talked about it at home as a family. A type of setting that it’s already in.\n",
      "Interviewer: Gotcha. Alright, so now that we know the who and the where, let’s talk about what, like what should they talk about? So what questions about CBT, we kind of already talked about this, if you had any questions, but if you could think of anything for the videos, what questions about CBT do you think the characters need to ask and/ or answer within the video?\n",
      "Speaker: Well depending on how young the audience is [15:11] ____, if it’s going to hurt; if it’s anything physical, because when you think of a doctor, you think more of a regular, general doctor. How long something might take. How long the session might be. Just about the confidentiality part- that it’s a safe place to say anything. I can’t think of anything else.\n",
      "Interviewer: So do you think we should include how CBT, the explanation of how anxiety can become a problem in someone’s life, and do you think that should be discussed in the video as well?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah. The why, the general why you should go to [16:00] ___ how it can help, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Should we ask how it has worked for other kids?\n",
      "Speaker: If it has worked?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah. How or if it has worked for other kids.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Should we ask about how exposures work?\n",
      "Speaker: Maybe? In the first video? [16:21] _____\n",
      "Interviewer: There’s no right or wrong answer it’s based upon parents’ perspective. What you feel you would’ve wanted to see.\n",
      "Speaker: Probably not initially.\n",
      "Interviewer: Not initially. Okay. Should we ask about what parents can or can’t do to help?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes. Definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer: Why would you say definitely?\n",
      "Speaker: Because that’s always helpful. Suggestions and expectations.\n",
      "Interviewer: How would you feel about there being doctors, for instance?\n",
      "Speaker: Doctors… I don’t know… that’s a good question on that. I’m used to seeing on TV… you know, those TV doctors that are usually not real, so I’m not sure if I’d relate well to that or not. I would probably relate more if it was like a parent or somebody from that level, someone more relatable.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense. So transitioning a little bit to the setting, what would be some good settings that we could have the video in?\n",
      "Speaker: I guess maybe more of a reenactment. Maybe you might start with a scene where somebody is encountering some kind of mental health challenge, and maybe that’s the starting point so you can identify what type of challenges people would have and then transition into entering therapy. I don’t know how long this video is going to be… transitioning into what kind of benefits you can bring through therapy or CBT and then finally having the final result of the miraculous cure- something to see the benefit out of it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sounds like showing the whole process- the problem to how it gets resolved.\n",
      "Speaker: Right. So maybe in the beginning you might relate to the person you’re watching because you’re saying, “Okay I can relate to that scenario.” Then maybe understand a little bit about how the process helped. You probably want to do this in like 30 seconds, right?\n",
      "Interviewer: That, we’re still deciding.\n",
      "Speaker: Our attention span probably isn’t that long.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well I guess from your perspective, how long do you think a video like this would be, like at what point are you saying, “This is too long.”\n",
      "Speaker: I was thinking about that. It’s almost like you’d want a short part of it to get people’s attention then maybe break off into a more detailed discussion. Could almost see that, like there’s some kind of carton video then it breaks off into the doctor coming in talking a little bit about what is happening, what the benefits would be, then maybe back into a video… might help to at least get somebody’s attention in the beginning.\n",
      "Interviewer: So multi-segmented, perhaps? Help them pay attention.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Just in terms of specific locations, would you think that showing things at home would be relevant or important?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah there’s a lot of possible scenarios for kids. There’s school where you’re maybe having peer pressures that you encounter, and of course home life is always a challenge for us all, isn’t it? So, because there’s so many things you could treat with CBT, I’m not quite sure… it’d be hard to pick one.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about like the therapist’s office?\n",
      "Speaker: Therapist’s office… probably could, just to get people… you know, when I grew up, when I was a kid someone going to the therapist’s office was kind of stigmatizing. At least from my perspective, I’m past that, but maybe not everybody is.\n",
      "Interviewer: How would you address the issue of stigma, especially for parents who are from an era where, as you said, it was more stigmatized?\n",
      "Speaker: People like my age, I’m talking to my parents, that age particularly, their response now is, “We wish we knew those things back then.” Their main response is, “We didn’t even know there was options out there for improving mental health.”  I think it’s important if you’re looking at it as being something more stigmatizing now or you don’t want your neighbors to know that you’re going, years later it’s definitely something you’d look back on and say, “I wish I had taken those steps at that time.”\n",
      "Interviewer: So sounds like growing up [16:52] ___ the opportunity is valuable.\n",
      "Speaker: Right. So you may not recognize it on the front end, but you will definitely see it on the back end.\n",
      "Speaker: …Talking, a lot of talking and… discussing what is happening throughout life and how to work through whatever… whatever issues have come up throughout life basically.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Perfect. So when you first learned about the therapy we do here, CBT, do you remember any questions that you had about the process or just CBT in general?\n",
      "Speaker: No. Things had become so chaotic in our life at home. You know, we went to our pediatrician and… just said please help and she said go here and we said okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Did you know anything about CBT going in?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: No? Okay. So how much did you know about CBT from movies, TV, the internet, or other people in general?\n",
      "Speaker: Nothing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Nothing? Okay so you didn’t know anything. So thinking about your experience with CBT were there any parts of the therapy that were confusing or- yeah, that were confusing?\n",
      "Speaker: No. You know, we didn’t really have a lot of discussion about, you know, what was going to happen or- it was just everything had become so incredibly chaotic… it was, something has to happen and something has to change. Help us and the pediatrician said do this and we were doing this.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So if someone were to ask you about CBT, what would you want to tell them if they were about to start the therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: For us, it’s been- for us specifically with [NAME REDACTED] because we have- we’ve done it with [NAME REDACTED] and, you know, we’ve got the younger ones in therapy now also for different reasons but… for [NAME REDACTED] it’s been extremely helpful. She obviously still has anxiety, I don’t think that’s something that’s ever going to change. It’s just part of her personality and who she is. But we can talk her through… panic attacks and calm her down just through talking and… but having another outlet in a different person for her to talk to… is absolutely a wonderful thing for her to have.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Great. So when you think about how you felt about CBT when you first learned about it, can you think of three words to describe how you felt? I know it would be kind of a weird question but…\n",
      "Speaker: I didn’t really know anything about it, at that point. So…\n",
      "Interviewer: So when you first learned about it. After it was explained to you, did you have any thoughts in your mind about CBT? That could be in 3 words.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t really know how to answer that because that was so – that was so long ago. I’m sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. That’s okay. Maybe we’ll circle back around to that question. So the goal of CBT is to reduce anxiety so if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life, what would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: I feel like… for… for us, I think a lot of [NAME REDACTED] had to do with external factors… I think it’s always, you know, there as a part of her personality but I think external factors exacerbate it. I think we’ve had a lot of family drama, which for her triggers that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you would say family drama is one of your external factors?\n",
      "Speaker: Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Are there any other external factors that exacerbate her anxiety?\n",
      "Speaker: School drama, which sadly being a teenage girl, is a factor of life.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yup. Okay. These are good examples. So what is important for other patients to know about how anxiety becomes an issue? So like you said external factors like school, family. What would be important for patients to know when starting CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: It has to be a very honest process. That’s one of the- that’s one of the concerns I had with [NAME REDACTED], you know, because she’s very reserved and closed off, is that she wouldn’t be-she wouldn’t give it a chance and really open up to anybody. So, it has to be a very honest process.\n",
      "Interviewer: So I wonder, just to tease this out a little bit further, in both this idea of anosognosia or just not being able to perceive that the illness is a problem or even not being able to perceive the clutter, and also in overvalued ideation if you really believe that an item is valuable to the point that it's very unreasonable, that almost sounds like a little bit of a delusion kind of thing, you know. Like really not being able to perceive reality in a concrete way, really believing strongly in that a piece of paper or an empty can are just super super valuable or looking at a space that is unusable and you can't even walk in and just seeing no clutter. And I don't know, I guess I just kind of want to check with you and see if that's what you see with your patients, this kind of like almost delusional like lack of touch with reality or is it somewhere in between?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think it's a really good point and it's definitely come up within hoarding, it's come up with OCD. For example, like OCD can look sometimes like a psychotic disorder, for somebody endorsing some pretty strange beliefs and with some overvalued ideation around it that I think are the same thing, like you were mentioning with hoarding disorder like, \"I need to save this for this reason\" and there's this kind of fixed aspect to it, whereas it's just the way that it is, it's just right or wrong.\n",
      "Interviewer: So there was this interesting paper that Randy Frost published which broke the concept of insight down into different constructs, and I'd just like to read them to you and have you comment on how you encounter these different sorts of insight, if you think that some are more relevant than others? So the first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia, which is where you're unable to even perceive your illness or that anything is wrong or causing you distress, the third one is overvalued ideation, and that's kind of believing that your items are more valuable than they truly are, and the last one is indifference. Do any of these, all of these seem like they're relevant for your patients? Is there one that you think is more important or less important?\n",
      "Interviewee: I certainly think the defensiveness is the one that resonates the most. That's something we just see day in and day out, even from folks that are willing to work with us and I think a lot of it seems to come from the fear that we're not gonna understand their stuff or value their stuff and that we're gonna judge them. They know that the system overall can be very punitive, and so what we find is once we make it clear that we're not gonna take their stuff because that's not our role, or tell them what to do, that they have control of their stuff no matter what, the defensiveness seems to break down. A lot of it really seems to be very fear-based.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, when you encounter people who have this disorder and have very low insight, would you say that they truly don't know that there's anything different about them or their lives than other people? That they're truly bling to the fact that they have something about them that's different? Or is it more that they don't acknowledge that that difference is a problem?\n",
      "Interviewee: It feels like they know that not everybody else sees their stuff in their situation the way that they do, and aren't able to see the reasons that that might be a problem. I don't think it's willful disobedience or willful avoidance in most cases, but in some cases sometimes it might be. You know, I think a lot of it is all centered around perception and ability to kind of do the analysis that is required to have accurate perception.\n",
      "Interviewer: So would you say that when one of those individuals looks at their space, that they can't see how cluttered it is? That they see a normal space, even when it's clearly not normal?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well normal for them at least. You know, I think they can't see the health and safety issues and the volume in the same way that the rest of us would see.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you feel like that's just because they're so used to it or do you feel like that's almost in the level of like a delusion?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it's hard for me to know sometimes. There are certainly some people where they just do not see it, and then there are some people where they might say, \"Oh it's a little bit messy but it's not that bad.\" as we're looking at something that's fairly severe. And so, you know, I generally don't think that it's avoidance as much as it is sometimes it feels like the brain's not giving them accurate data to work with.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, kind of along the same lines we can imagine for normal individuals a variance in how they like to keep their space. So for example, some people might love to have a very clear desk and only be able to work when the desk is clear; whereas other people might actually really like a crowded desk or feeling that their items are all around them, and I wonder if you've ever conceptualized or thought about hoarding disorder as being a part of that spectrum? So do you feel like perhaps a part of hoarding disorder is about liking the creation of inclosed space, or liking to be surrounded maybe on a spectrum like fear of open spaces, like the opposite or something like that where people just really like to be inclosed by items.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah actually that's a good point. Yeah, I think that that definitely could be the case. But I think that what's really important here if we're looking at diagnosing hoarding disorder, and actually all mental health disorders in general, I think this gets overlooked. That that last criteria, which is that like clinically significant distress and functional impairment, if the person likes it and they are not subjectively identifying any problems with their homes and yeah somebody from the outside is saying you need to do something, but they are not--so I guess if you have somebody saying, \"you're going to be evicted\" that is causing functional impairment and clinically significant distress because the state of their home is leading to them not having a residence, which then would cause distress and impairment. But if there wasn't, let's say they own their own home and the individual really does enjoy just having a lot of items around and there's some sort of safety or comfort that's associated with it and it's not actually getting in the way, like it's not impairing their ability to work or to be social or to do their hobbies or what have you, I think that that wouldn't be criteria for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, this criteria you're talking about, the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use, I guess I'm wondering...well two things. First of all, you gave the example of a supplemental housing situation where they only have one room, and I'm wondering how you make an assessment of hoarding disorder when people can occupy such different amounts of space. So, if you owned a mansion and were very very rich and could afford kind of infinite storage units, such that your space was never compromised, would you ever have hoarding disorder? Would you ever meet criteria for hoarding disorder? Versus somebody who is living in a one bedroom apartment where the amount of stuff they have, you know, you could have a very normal amount of stuff but if you don't have any space, your space will be congested. So, how do you take that into account and do you take that into account? Would a person who has a mansion ever have hoarding disorder if they couldn't fill up their mansion?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, for me the answer is yes and I've had the opportunity to treat a number of people over the years who have sort of unlimited resources and a woman in Massachusetts comes right to mind. She lived in a over 6,0000 square foot home, she had a full staff of people, and while all of that was true and she had a team of people who were literally helping her manage the accumulation of possessions so that the physical interference was somewhat kept at bay, the other elements that we've been talking about, that is the attachment to the objects through the strong beliefs and the emotions, the kind of avoidance behaviors, all of that was deeply intact and interfering in her ability to live as she wished to be living. So this was a woman who, for example, couldn't let any water run down the drain without...she had to save in the sink or in the shower, she collected all of that water and stored it and repurposed it. And so you can see the sort of ideas there and the interference in her ability to sort of live in a normal, whatever that means, way even though the clutter was being managed, the same ideas were also the wastefulness and being in control and these perfectionistic ideas generalized from clothing and books to water in this case. So I think space is, yes it's certainly made complicated by the fact that someone who moved from 2300 square feet to 900 square feet now has to manage their hoarding, but we know that those things are not causal in any way. So, the space alone is not causal but makes diagnosis certainly more complicated, assessment diagnosis more complicated. It doesn't necessarily make intervention more complicated, once you have clearly decided what it is, then you can kind of go forward from there.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, right, right, cuz everybody just has less space to live, that's interesting. I also want to ask you about this idea of intended use. So we could imagine a healthy person who, for example, has a spare bed room that they use for storage, or doesn't cook and therefore doesn't use their kitchen for cooking, but instead uses it for storage. So I wonder how you think about this concept of compromising intended use. Like, who's intended use and how do you make judgments about whether that's appropriate or not?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think that's a really good question. When we think about intended use, I think it probably does kind of come from this, I guess societal, just in general what do we use a kitchen for, what was that designed for, when someone built that home, that apartment, they thought that you would be cooking in it. But, then again, that is not obviously taking the person's view point into consideration or like their own experience and their values and if they don't care about cooking or that's not something they ever want to do, you know, is that compromising the use? I think for the intended use, like the same thing can come up with OCD, for example, like if someone is fearful of starting a fire because of the stove, they might not use their stove or their kitchen for cooking whatsoever. It doesn't mean that it's cluttered, but they're still not using it and so the OCD has compromised the room's use, but then I've had people say, \"Well I don't care about cooking, it has no value in cooking at all so I don't even want to work on that because that's not a value of mine,\" and so I could see how that could come up. I think with hoarding disorder what we think about is if someone moved or lived with a family member who wasn't struggling with hoarding or you know, or if we were to think about what is the typical use of a kitchen, to cook, or a bedroom to sleep, I think that even if an individual suggests that that's not how they intend to use it, I think the way we've looked at it is that intended use is more like the blueprint. Like what did the architect intend for this space to be used and how was that planned to be used or maybe even how did they plan to use it originally. Maybe when they first moved into the home they did a little bit of cooking, or maybe they ate at their table but now they're not eating. So, I think I do like to, especially when this is just clinical practice and not a research study, I do like to kind of obviously meet the person where they're at and if they don't care about the kitchen or they don't care about cooking, maybe they care about being able to host people in their living room and have a space for people to sit and enjoy the conversation or something like that. So, kind of looking at what uses or what are they not doing in their home that they would like to do, and then focusing on that, especially when we're looking at just treatment in a community setting and not like placing my own values on somebody. Like, kitchens need to be used for cooking and focusing more on that. But in terms of diagnosis, I know that's what we're talking about, it's an interesting question. There's a little bit of a bias in thinking that others should be using their homes in a specific kind of way.\n",
      "Interviewer: And we're gonna talk through this criteria in a little bit more detail. I'm also wondering how you make distinctions, or if it's ever tricky to make distinctions between hoarding disorder and other possibly comorbid disorders, specifically depression and OCD. Do you ever have difficulty in kind of discriminating between a hoarding disorder patient and an OCD patient and a depressed patient?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think it's important to know, especially with OCD, to know OCD well and when you're--because of course hoarding, difficulty discarding possessions can definitely be a part of OCD, even now they could still be a part of OCD, even though hoarding disorder has its own separate diagnosis. So, I think being careful and when you're looking at differentiating between OCD and hoarding disorder, for example, making sure that hoarding is the primary issue and is basically what the person is struggling with can help you decide whether or not it's assumed as under OCD, as well as looking at some of these OCD-themed...like I've worked with folks, I worked with an individual who was diagnosed with OCD and not hoarding disorder, although had difficulties discarding, and not so much acquiring, it was more discarding. But that was because she was fearful of making a mistake and throwing something out that was important and that she would need, so we would check it several times and it was kind of consistent with her other checking behaviors, which she was also worried about catastrophe and fires and so she would check her door and check her stove, and so it was really consistent with the OCD presentations. So it fits in with the way that we were conceptualizing her OCD; whereas if that wouldn't have been the case, if hoarding was actually the primary issue, we would likely not have diagnosed, she wouldn't have gotten the diagnosis of OCD.\n",
      "Interviewer: So in this case what seems to be the most important factor in making that distinction is not about their space, but it's about their reasons why they are saving. If they are more reasons that are more related to OCD behaviors or if they're true hoarding, yeah?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right yeah. And I think um, and that could be, you know I guess this might be a questions in research, like how often does OCD and hoarding disorder, is that diagnosed. I've never diagnosed both and I don't know if there'd be a situation where you could argue that that could happen, but I've never actually diagnosed both and I think that because of the newer diagnosis and because it's related to OCD, you know, I guess technically you probably could diagnose both. I mean if you look at the why box on hoarding, I think it's still on there, although I don't know if that will change in the future or if we will continue to keep those items in OCD or look to separating the two more. I think that'll be a question for research and for a future study, like does that make sense and is it counterindicated or does OCD kind of explain a person's difficulties with hoarding, is it necessary to give them another label or not, and I guess what would prompt an individual to do that? But yeah, those are good questions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you see, and this is of particular interest to me, but do you see kind of cultural values relating to the proper way to own items or dispose of them or maybe forces associating value and self-worth with ownership and material goods, do you see them as related? And maybe one example may be people who save things because they're worried about the environment. Do you feel like those reasons that people give to save are reflections of those kinds of, maybe like larger ideas about the place of items in the world and the things that can happen with them? I don't know, that was a very vague question.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah no, I see them. Certainly my social work and sociology training, I see them as intricately connected. I think, and again I think we haven't scratched the surface here, but I think it ranges from personal values and cultural elements across the cultural and societal levels. So, I sort of see that PCS model. I think all of our notions about how much is too much and cleanliness and not cleanliness and wastefulness and ideas of what is good and all of those things are culturally determined, and I think they're reinforced, personally they're reinforced at the familial level and they're certainly reinforced societally. I think further complicating that are cultural elements of economic structures and systems. I think there are cultural elements of private ownership of goods and the value of ownership of goods that are certainly culturally and societally driven. One of the things that I'm, you know I remain quite interested in, is in societies where private ownership is not valued in the ways that that it is in the global north, what would we see around hoarding? Would the phenomenon even have roots, because it couldn't manifest in the same ways? So, I think yeah I think there's a whole pile of questions and no answers in that category, but I certainly see culture and society as being deeply influential around this problem.\n",
      "10:22 Interviewer:\n",
      "I’ve never heard of those, but that sounds great. So how severe would you say that this behavior is now compared to when you were a kid?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think it’s worse now because I’m collecting more and buying more than I could have when I was a kid. 10:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "What kind of items do you collect?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well lately I’ve been buying some books, and then like I said, some tech equipment. Let’s see… Well obviously I’ve been buying a lot of stuff on Amazon for the house. We’ve been collecting toilet paper.\n",
      "11:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, the COVID crisis definitely increases my online shopping, for sure.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh for sure, and hoarding too!\n",
      "11:13 Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think that your issues with clutter have increased because of the stay at home order or has it been the same?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I think so a little bit, just because I have more time and freedom to, you know, buy things. Yeah, and then just being home more… more places to not clean up. 11:39 Interviewer:\n",
      "So have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I keep making little attempts, especially when my husband or child gets upset with me and says, “Just do one thing a day,” and I start doing that for maybe a day or two, and then I don’t. 12:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever gone to a professional to help with this behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "12:06 Interviewer 1: Okay, so you mentioned that sometimes your family members get a little bit upset. What are some of the things that they want you to do other than cleaning up persay? Do they get upset when you buy new things or….\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah, husband especially gets upset, but then mostly it’s been stuff for the house, so he can’t get upset with this!\n",
      "12:35 Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever had conflicts with other people close to you that aren’t family members, like landlords or other people?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh no, thank God. No, that hasn’t been a problem. It’s been family because most of it is, well, in the home is cluttered.\n",
      "12:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right. So speaking of your home, the next section of questions I have is about your space and your living area, and how you see your home. Can you describe where you live now?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I live in a single family home. I live with my husband and one of my adult daughters. It’s in a suburb and… oh go ahead..\n",
      "13:22 Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, no, I was just going to ask, what is the space like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s a small home. It’s got about 900 square feet, and technically there are three bedrooms. They’re very small and, you know, there’s a lot of stuff in this house, and some of it is is co-collected by my husband or there’s other things, and I’m not responsible for that room right now, although some of it is my stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: How would you feel about doctors or therapist treating them? Would you also include them in these videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I think so. I mean I think I would not start with therapist. I would start with patients and their parents.\n",
      "Interviewer: So parents are important too.\n",
      "Speaker: If it’s appropriate for age. I mean I guess that questions what age you are talking about.\n",
      "Interviewer: So I think just for some information it’s meant to be designed for 10 to 16 year olds which is arrange because obviously 10 year olds differ a lot from 16 year olds and there also the parents on top of it.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I would just make sure to have an age range of kids. I would start with the kids and their experience and then I would only you know… I guess it depends on who you are trying to convince. If you are trying to bring in kids then I would have them talk about their experiences first.\n",
      "Interviewer: For the parental side, what do you think would be best for like a parent?\n",
      "Speaker: I think… yeah seeing kids and other parents is good. [25:20] ___ parental experience in there as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: In terms of setting, is there anything in particular that kind of stands out as a setting for the video to take place in?\n",
      "Speaker: Um well I would say more.  I would personally think it would be better if it were an individual’s home rather than clinical settings or… yeah that would be my thought. I don’t know. I’m not sure I would think of\n",
      "Interviewer: I’m curious can you tell me why you lean towards like the home as opposed to a medical office or to a doctor’s office.\n",
      "Speaker: Well 99% of your time you are in the home. 99% of the time you are dealing with issues there. [26:14] ___ and your looking how is your life going to be outside of there you know.  I think it’s maybe appropriate when you are talking to a clinician or whoever and say ok you know these are tools we used, these are the things we do, or whatever. We have that in a clinical setting, but I think putting people in a clinical setting turns them into patients rather than people. So I think if you want to appeal to people put in a home setting, not a clinical setting.\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s not medicalized\n",
      "Speaker: Yup. They are not patients. They are people.\n",
      "Interviewer: In that line uh kids especially are spending a lot of time in school. How would you feel like school being in the background?\n",
      "Speaker: I mean school would be an appropriate environment. I think sometimes though these... I think it would need to be dependent on what the specific anxiety is or specific issue that they are dealing with. I don’t think especially that age, I don’t know. Middle school for sure. I’m not sure.  I mean I think are… less likely to be open about their issues that they are dealing with so. I think it can even be anxiety producing for some individuals. I think you know to some extent it would helpful to have it in a safe at least or what would be perceived as a safe environment for children.\n",
      "Interviewer: One of the things I asked you about in the listing portion of the interview was about how you could tell if somebody had hoarding disorder. I'm wondering if in your mind as somebody who works with these individuals a lot, there's kind of like a soft set of criteria or a typical description of a person with hoarding disorder? Do you feel like if you were to describe a person with hoarding disorder without actually talking about their stuff, that like a cohesive description of that person would emerge? Does that make sense as a question?\n",
      "Interviewee: It does, and you know it would be so hard to do because all of our folks are really kind of different in terms of our, if you look at our data folks tend to be single, tend to be in their 50s or 60s, our folks have an average income of 13,000. That's because our program is primarily geared to work with lower income folks who are kind of most vulnerable around housing situations. But overall it's interesting because they're actually much better educated than our group in Boston, which is a fairly well-educated population. So, you know, I think it's tough to make some generalities without kind of looking at their particular relationships with the stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess I'm, I don't know, sometimes when I ask for that list, even with clinicians I get this kind of very kind of personality-based description. You know, like somebody who's really scattered, who's very vivacious and talks a lot, and I'm wondering if that resonated with you as to the people that you see, that they kind of have this typical manner of being?\n",
      "Interviewee: It's interesting because you say that and in some of the folks that description is very very accurate, and then there's a lot of folks where that wouldn't be accurate at all, that they're very kind of hyper-organized and very quiet or very exacting. And so, I would feel really uncomfortable actually making a generality.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, that's exactly, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: Because we see such a wide range in terms of personalities. I think the thing that is much more consistent is the themes around why people hold onto their stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I'll follow up our conversation today with an email. We're actually gonna start, I told you at the beginning, we're gonna start talking to patients shortly and I'm actually building a whole section. So we have, this is totally off topic from the interview, but we have a partnership with [NAME 46:35]'s lab and hopefully [NAME 46:37]'s lab and they both have large kind of research studies going on in hoarding disorder, so a large body of patients who have already consented to do research and we're gonna be calling and doing interviews and asking them about home and what they think of when they think of home and how their space, how items contribute to the building of their home. So, if that would be something that you would like to help us to design, that's the stage that we're at--the design stage--and hopefully we'll be starting within the next couple of months with the patient interviews, so if that's interesting to you I would love to like really really truly deeply would love to have mentorship on that because it's something that I've been doing totally on my own.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah for sure, let's continue the conversation about it.\n",
      "Interviewer: For that criteria, the difficulty discarding results in accumulation that congest and clutter and substantially compromise intended use, I wonder also if you think that external factors may play a role in that substantially compromising of intended use. For example, if somebody is very wealthy and lives in a extremely large home, versus somebody who lives in a trailer and has less space, is it possible to be so wealthy that you never compromise your intended...you know, your space's intended use because you have many storage units, for example?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah that's a really good question. I think that definitely could be possible and I think--or let's say someone, you have money and you're extremely wealthy and all your family does clean-outs or something like that, maybe somebody, not that I've heard many people sanction those or enjoy those to any degree, most people don't want that to happen. But if for some reason a person's space is not compromised because they have so much space or because there's been a forces clean-out or like family has been doing it, I think that that would be--those would be situations where yes, I think a diagnosis would be missed because their space isn't compromised right now, you know, even though it could be, eventually. Like let's say the person has so much space it could take many many years and maybe it would never get there so maybe it would never rise to that level of clinical significance in a way that the DSM writes. And I think that that's maybe the reason, actually in our lab the other day we were noticing that a lot of research and a lot of news articles about hoarding were coming out of the UK and we were hypothesizing about why that might be, and one thing thing that got brought up is that the UK, they tend to live in smaller spaces and I wonder if places like San Francisco of New York where people live in smaller spaces, if that might then just make the problem more salient.\n",
      "Interviewer: So we touched a little bit on this piece, about what they should talk about, but like further going into that, what types of questions should be asked or answers should be had?\n",
      "Speaker: Somebody who’s looking at this… hmm… I’m not sure about that. I’d say I’m not sure about that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Should there be an explanation perhaps of how anxiety becomes a problem? Is that something that would be useful?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I think… or that there’s help out there to improve those things. It’s not something that you should just… it’s not necessarily something that you can just deal with on your own. You might need some help.\n",
      "Interviewer: So like recognizing it as an issue.\n",
      "Speaker: Right, like if you want to be a professional football player, you’re probably going to recognize you need training, you need coaches; there’s a lot of things you can do that can help you. Maybe there’s some analogy there too… you know, it’s like in therapy can help you… there’s somebody there… you can definitely improve what you’re doing. There’s definitely probably more sports analogies you can give for kids, there might be other analogies kids or parents could relate to that scenario where you wouldn’t think twice about getting help. If I wanted to learn tennis I would certainly want to hire a teacher rather than sit out there by myself trying to figure it out. So, in this case here, going into a therapist or somebody who can help you figure these things out a lot easier than trial and error.\n",
      "TRANSCRIPTION PAUSED\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, right. How about discussing how it’s worked for others? I think you kind of mentioned that a little bit earlier. At least in your opinion, you saw that it’s been effective. Do you think that’s worth discussing?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yeah. I think it’s been effective, just kind of watching it in my family, and yeah- I think so. When it came out that was the big excitement, CBT- there was a method that could perhaps give a lot faster improvements than the other forms of therapy did before that. That was the appeal I heard about originally, “Wow, there’s something that actually might have noticeable benefits that doesn’t take 10 years of laying on a couch,” and there’s no laying on a couch, as far as I know, too.\n",
      "Interviewer: Should there be discussion about exposures and how they work?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I think so. I think it’s something people can quickly understand how that would work, like you’re having trouble with something- I talk about anxieties, that’s one I’m more familiar with- and the idea of exposing yourself gradually to that. Eventually you can be exposed to higher and higher levels.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about from a parent perspective? What types of things should be discussed on what is helpful for parents to do versus what’s not helpful for parents to do?\n",
      "Speaker: I had this discussion before with a therapist, and myself as a parent kind of frustrated like, “I don’t know what to do,” is where a kind of found myself is like yeah, I want to help my children, but I can’t figure out how to do it, and the one answer I got back that I liked was, “Coming here, that was a good idea.” You find yourself maybe not… there’s help out there, let’s put it that way. Definitely you want to be involved as a parent. You don’t just want to drop your kids off and pick them up at the end of therapy.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like involvement’s important, actually being a figure and being a part of the team.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, kind of a related idea that there's been a little research about but not a ton is along the lines of kind of what you were talking about with sentimental value, and I'm wondering if you feel like there's a relationship between hoarding disorder and memory or patients' ideas about memories?\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhhm, yeah, good question. I think that a lot of patients believe that> I don't know, maybe for some it is the case that they do struggle with memory and maybe because of that executive function difficulty or problems, maybe there are some like cognitive developments. But I hear it a lot as just like a reason for keeping something, that \"if I don't have this reminder, this cue, I won't remember.\" And I think I tend to challenge that in therapy, because I tend to ask people to test that out for themselves like are they sure they won't remember? What tells them they won't remember? Are they sure they have--like where is this coming from that they have this bad memory? I think it's almost like this fear that they'll forget, it's like this fear of forgetting, like if I don't have this cue then I won't remember this time or this person and that of course the object is a reliable cue for that memory. However, for a lot of these folks, when we're doing exposures, for example, they'll come across things they haven't seen and, you know, 10 years. And so ultimately they're not actually using the items that are a cue to remember. So I might reflect that as well, like it sounds like, and maybe even asking somebody like, \"Have you thought about that memory in the last 10 years even without the cue of the item?\" And I think that can be a way to get at whether or not they're actually [INAUDIBLE 1:06:05] or if they're difficulties with memory. I think that a lot of patients do believe, or that is a reason for why a lot of people have a perceived need to keep those items, is that they're fearful that they'll forget.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, mhmm. Okay, well I'm gonna move into the more conversational interview and we're gonna talk about a lot of the issues that came up in our list in more detail, but before we get started if you wouldn't mind just giving me like a...I don't know, two minute introduction to who you are and your training and background and how you came to be involved with patients with this disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, sure of course. So I'm a clinical psychologist and I am just out of my post-doc, so I pretty much [INAUDIBLE 20:36] last year, in the OCD and related disorders track and so that was specialized training in treating folks diagnosed with OCD and hoarding disorder [INAUDIBLE 20:49] primary to diagnosing that I focused on and um--but before then, so the reason I guess I can kind of share with you how I got there. So, in the beginning of my graduate school journey, I went to grad school in [INSTITUTION 21:05] in Portland, outside of Portland, Oregon and I was always interested in anxiety disorders in general and exposure therapy in particular and I knew that going into grad school and so I knew I wanted to get some training in that and when I was at [INSTITUTION 21:18] doing my grad school program, I basically I pursued those interests and it wasn't actually hoarding at that point, it was more like OCD and other social anxiety and disorders like that that I was primarily interested in, at first. And then I just joined a research team called The Anxiety Research Team where there was a vertical mentoring process happening, where some of the more advanced students were mentoring the kind of first and second year grad students and I was passed along some articles and I did some research projects around, more like lit reviews and small presentations for like community conferences or local conferences and things like that. But I started researching treatments for hoarding disorder, I guess at that point it wasn't even its own diagnosis yet when I first started grad school but for OCD and anxiety and I was pretty intrigued. I also found out during that time that those treatments really weren't available, so I think I got really passionate about really learning those treatments and learning how to provide those treatments well and being able to offer those treatments to the community, because so many people struggle to find services. I remember reading prolonged exposure for PTSD was the gold standard treatment, but yet nobody really [INAUDIBLE 22:35] and nobody really was offering it, not many psychologists provide exposure therapy in general, so I think I just became really passionate about learning about those treatments and specializing in those treatments. So, I got linked up to a community, essentially a private practice, but it was called The Anxiety and Panic Treatment Center in Portland, and I did my practicum, too, there and then I stayed working through clinical field work for the remainder of my grad training, in addition to doing other places because I enjoy it so much and I was learning quite a bit and I was doing work with folks with hoarding disorder as well as OCD and then I guess also other anxiety disorders, like panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder. There were two clinicians who kind of ran that clinic who were local experts and so I was able to learn a lot from them and also were able to provide people, in particular folks with hoarding disorder were able to provide in-home services. So, I was able to do in-home exposures and decluttering sessions with folks, whereas no one else in the community was doing that. So, we were like the only people in the Portland area who offered that service and it was really just me basically doing it for a while, or just the grad students basically, because we were able to offer a sliding scale and because we were more flexible we were able to actually go into the homes and do the exposures. So I got some experience there and I learned quite a bit from those experiences. I even was contracted or was, I don't know exactly, it wasn't official in that way but the county actually reached out to me and asked me to work with an individual who was threatened with eviction. And so the county, the county task force was also trying to find ways to solve kind of the public health problems that are associated with some individuals struggling with hoarding disorder. So I was kind of navigating that and learning about that and also at the same time trying to implement the CBT towards hoarding disorder, basically, in a couple of cases where I went out to people's homes. And form that I went to internship, which was at a VA and I didn't really do much with hoarding, I was more focused on PTSD, and then I kind of went to the post-doc at [NAME 24:38] lab and focused on supervising the various instructor's workshops that we have going. And then I did home decluttering and I did the in-home decluttering sessions myself with a couple of participants over several weeks, we did 10 sessions of in-home decluttering and then I also worked with some folks individually and I'm planning to eventually, I'm working in the clinic at [INSTITUTION 25:03] and I'm eventually hoping to start some hoarding [INAUDIBLE 25:06] or like CBT groups for hoarding so that's kind of my plan for the next year or two, is to try to get something set up there because of how limited the resources are and there just isn't a lot out there for folks struggling with this.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, because, you know, my work space is kind of papers all over the place, and they’ve continually told me, many times, to keep my workspace organized and clean. And it's like, but I know where everything is here! But I could’ve cleaned it up more, I didn’t need all those papers around at all times.\n",
      "32:42 Interviewer:\n",
      "So would you be upset if you hid to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not general items. If it’s stuff that I’ve collected or have sentimental attachment to I would be upset.\n",
      "33:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "So if it’s just something lying around the house that doesn’t have any emotional attachment, then you would be okay getting rid of it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "33:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so that was actually my last question for you. So now I’m just going to ask you a couple of demographic questions just so we have that. So my first one is; gender identity?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "33:29 Interviewer:\n",
      "Your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female\n",
      "33:33 Interviewer:\n",
      "Your race?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Caucasian\n",
      "33:38 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ethnicity? Do you identify as hispanic or latino?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I identify as Jewish actually. Well actually, ethnically, I’m 99.7!\n",
      "33:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and general household income? You can give me a range.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "100,000 a year.\n",
      "34:02 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay and your geographic region?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "West.\n",
      "34:08 Interviewer:\n",
      "And your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "AA degree, associates degree.\n",
      "34:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, and would you prefer an electronic Amazon gift card by email or physical gift card? I do have to say that if you do choose a physical gift card, it could take up to 3 to 4 weeks to get to you because of COVID.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, email gift card is fine.\n",
      "Speaker: …A parent, you know, like a parent-child relationship could be… at home or even in a vehicle. I know a lot of parents, you know, that’s where they spend a lot of time with their kids.\n",
      "Interviewer: In the car. Going to school.\n",
      "Speaker: In the cars. Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So now that we have the setting and the characters, we have to decide what they would be talking about. So we’ve already started talking about CBT itself. So what questions about CBT do our characters need to ask and get answered?\n",
      "Speaker: That I don’t know. Because I didn’t know anything about it. It was just a last-ditch effort because… [NAME REDACTED] was a disaster. I… I mean [NAME REDACTED] was falling apart.\n",
      "Interviewer: So should they find out about CBT- about the CBT explanation of how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life? So should they talk about anxiety itself and how it becomes an issue?\n",
      "Speaker: I think that’s a great idea. I mean, I wish- I wish somebody… had, you know, said something to us before [NAME DEDACTED] had reached the point that she did, you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: So now we get to decide how the video will look so we have a couple of examples. Here, and I’ll let you look through them. There’s 3 choices, so you can look through these and tell me what you like about them, what you don’t like about them, and what you think would be the best choice for our video-videos.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t like the… option 2.\n",
      "Interviewer: So the vector art?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah… I don’t know that option 1 with interview style is going to do well with… kids though. Getting kids to pay attention.\n",
      "Interviewer: And the third option?\n",
      "Speaker: That’s kind of comic book style which would… I think kids will like.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you would say that the 3rd option is your favorite? Or…\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: How-why do you like the comic book idea. So you said you like this one the best, what makes this one the best one?\n",
      "Speaker: I think kids are… into- not so much teenagers these days but… the younger kids are into reading comic books. Books, not the actual comic book style but comic book style books. These days. So, you know, it’ll catch their attention as far as the graphics go. My 7-year-old, that’s her favorite is the comic book style books.\n",
      "Interviewer: So option 3 it is. So, now that we’ve figured out how it would look and where it would be, who’s in it. What do you think the take home message of the videos should be?\n",
      "Speaker: …That it’s definitely okay to get… help and support. You know, I still think there’s some sort of stigma attached with therapy and counseling for a lot of people which is ridiculous. Not only that and you know… I don’t know maybe some of the benefits?\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know how to work all that in but.\n",
      "Interviewer: Of course. So circling back around to that 3 word question. Now that we’ve talked a bit about CBT, do you think you could- do you think you could think of 3 words that you would use to describe CBT and how you feel about it?\n",
      "Speaker: How I- excuse me, how I feel about it now or how I felt about it then?\n",
      "Interviewer: I think either or, you know, you’ve experienced it with your daughter so how does it make you feel?\n",
      "Speaker: How does it make me feel? Hopeful.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: Three words… Three words should not be hard to find…\n",
      "Interviewer: So hopeful is a good one. So if you can’t think of 2 other ones, it’s okay. But if you could add a picture to your word, hopeful, for CBT. What would it be?\n",
      "Speaker: Just one picture.\n",
      "Interviewer: Whatever you can give me.\n",
      "Speaker: Me and [NAME REDACTED] sitting on the couch like this.\n",
      "Interviewer: Many of that we're gonna talk about more in just a minute. I'm gonna move through the criteria now and read you a phrase, and then we'll talk about the issues kind of as they come up. And, you know, I just want to hear as I read you the phrase what you think about when you apply this particular part of the criteria. The first part is persistent difficult discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value, and that really reminds me of the conversation we just had about how you determine actual value when you're in a, for instance, the example you gave where things are being sold to a chop shop and everybody is kind of scrambling for small amounts of money. So, what, how do you go about deciding if an item is valuable or not in that context and whether there is kind of inappropriate attachment versus appropriate attachment?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that's a very complicated question depending on who you ask, right, you get a very different answer. So my objective assessment, or seemingly objective assessment, is not objective at all of course because I'm influenced by my own cultural elements and all of those things play into this, right, so depending on who's making that assessment about the value of objects and certainly if you talk to the person who's doing the saving and the hoarding of those objects, they often are not of limited value and the monetary or market value is one value and it seems to be, in some ways, the implicit value that we assign as part of the diagnostic criteria. So I think other values are considered, but probably not equally so yeah, I think that phrase is really dependent on who's doing the assessment.\n",
      "Interviewer: And I guess what I'm wondering also is is the kind of lack of value or lack of selectivity a central component of hoarding disorder? I mean, can you hoard all of only one item? Can your house be full of cuckoo clocks and you have hoarding disorder? Or is the disorder necessary for the disorder? Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, well I don't, I would say that if the number of whatever the one object is is causing interference and it meets the rest of the criteria, probably I would say one item is sufficient, though it would be hard to imagine how the rest of the criteria would be met with that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "A lot of old papers, which I generally have to do that every year for income taxes, going through papers and stuff. And that’s not as hard as going through things like piles of clothes. So what I try to trash is stuff that’s old, meaning that you can’t use it anymore, things that I’m not using anymore. And not everything gets trashed because some things we give to, like there’s a local Goodwill type of thing, you know, so if there’s like clothes or other things that people can use, we gather those together periodically and bring those to that local place. But otherwise it’s paperwork, clothes that I’m not using or don’t fit…\n",
      "22:08 Interviewer:\n",
      "So things that you just can’t use anymore, that would be trash.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. 22:14 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. 2\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "There’s a lot of potential trash here too, that I’m not going through.\n",
      "22:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "You haven’t gone through it yet, so…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Like old various cords for old various computers I don’t have anymore and all that kind of stuff. I have a whole, you know, those red ice buckets, those big ones- I have one full of that crap! 22:39 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay, and what would you say is the most precious item in your house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well aside from the people in it and my puppy dog.. Precious, the most precious item in my house… just one?! 22:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "If you can choose one. 2Participant:\n",
      "The photos. 23:01 Interviewer:\n",
      "The photos?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, and included in photos are like videos and movies we take too. 23:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "Just the things that capture the memories.\n",
      "2Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "23:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think you have too much stuff? I know that you mentioned the clutter, it’s a lot, but how do you know you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well because kind of the house is overflowing with it, like, you know, even in terms of [23:33] INCOHERENT closet, and I hate going through that, but I guess I’m going to have to go through that again too because it’s like all these old medicines and things, but anyway there’s not even enough room to put towels in there and sheets, and sometimes they overflow out here and…\n",
      "23:57 Interviewer:\n",
      "So it’s an organizational and space issue.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, yes. 24:02 Interviewer:\n",
      "That’s how you know you have too much stuff.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "24:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So now I’m just going to ask you a couple questions about distinguishing hoarding disorder. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well collecting is more of an organized activity, where you know everything you have, you kind of may have lists of it, and you store them together in an orderly fashion.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, good question, what paper, would you mind? I'm just curious and--\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah it was a paper I think it was by Brandy Frost and colleagues where they were examining these kinds of ideas, I can send it to you if you're interested in it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah I would love to read that, yeah. Okay I do have some thoughts about that. So, I think, I've thought a lot about overvalued ideation and the lack of an ability to perceive a problem, like just not seeing clutter as an issue or maybe not even being able to see the clutter, really or perceive that the space, to not be able to recognize the illness in that way I think that's kind of what we were talking a little bit about with insight before, that an individual just might not be able to see that there's a problem. And so I think that definitely comes up a lot, I've seen that with most folks, but definitely some in particular that one individual who was coming in because of the threat of eviction, I think there was a lack of an ability to see the problem, I think that was probably one of the most important pieces as well. I think a lot of the times overvalued ideation, like this idea. I think that comes up a lot and that comes up in that people have, I already kind of mentioned, \"There's a specific way I have to discard of this item and it's so important that I do this in a very specific way and if not I'm a bad person,\" for example. And that thought becomes true, right, in that if this person doesn't discard in a specific kind of way, they're a bad person. So there's this maybe avoidance of discarding because they don't want to feel like a bad person. So I think the overvalued ideation comes up a lot and I think that can also come up in like generalized anxiety disorder and OCD as well, this idea that the symptoms are important, like \"My rituals are important, I need to do my checking because if not I might murder somebody and I don't want to be responsible for that.\"\n",
      "Interviewer: So like, they're really convinced that they have to do it or some terrible thing is going to happen to them.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right, exactly, exactly, so there might be that same thing happening in hoarding disorder like, \"I am convinced that I'm a bad person because I just contributed to this plastic thing in the ocean and maybe that means that these thoughts will never leave me, that I'm always going to feel like a bad person and that doing anything differently will just result in me getting stuck with all these thoughts and all these negative feelings and I want to make sure I do it right.\" And so a lot of times when we're doing like exposures for hoarding disorder, I think there is a bit of perfectionism in terms of overvalued ideation. There can be barriers to someone being willing to take a risk and throw away a plastic can in the trash and that can be something that someone is just not willing to do, and if that's the case then we can't do an exposure around it and we're kind of stuck, in a way, or we can become stuck if their overvalued ideation kind of prevents them from actually doing the exercises as related to the therapy.\n",
      "Interviewer: So there was this wonderful paper by Randy Frost about the concept of insight, which is really the big one that discusses it and breaks it down and he broke it down into four different constructs that one could talk about when one talks about insight, and I'm gonna read them to you. The first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia or kind of the lack of ability to perceive your illness or that something is wrong and causing you distress or reducing quality of life, the third is overvalued ideation, which is kind of the persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items which could be mild or could be delusional, and then the final one is indifference. And I wonder if you see all of these in your patients, if you see some of them as being more important than others or how you relate what you think of as insight or low insight to these different ideas of defensiveness, anosognosia, overvalued ideation and indifference?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think for me the first three I would say I see in equal distribution frequently, and sometimes overlapping. The indifference is...I see far less I would say, at least as I understand Randy to have been talking about it, and I think I also would say about the first three that I see them as present at different levels and with fluctuation as I was saying earlier. So, sometimes in the same patient, that defensiveness is really really patient and other times it is almost entirely absent. And I remember when I first started to treat this problem as a young [INAUDIBLE 58:57] clinician that was, that was a bit crazy-making for me. It was hard to understand how one day these problems around insight were so present, and then I'd sit with the same patient the next week and it was almost as if it was a different person talking about the same conditions. And then sure as I got familiar with that then here comes the defensiveness again or here comes the anosognosia or you know. So, yeah I think I could probably count on two hands the number of patients out of the hundreds that I've worked with where the indifference was very strong. I think it's a much more limited feature from my perspective.\n",
      "Interviewer: It's interesting to me because overvalued ideation certainly, and anosognosia perhaps to a lesser extent, almost sound like a psychosis or like an inability to perceive reality. Like you look at an object and you truly believe that it's worth more than it is in a way that departs from reality, or you look at a space and you truly cannot see the space as it exists, and I wonder if that's a part of insight for you? If that kind of like break from reality and the ability to perceive reality, is that a big part for you? Is that a small part?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it's a big part, though when I compare it to--I also do work in the area of animal hoarding--and when I compare those two to the sort of delusional, articulated, persistent delusional beliefs that we hear alongside animal hoarding, that makes the anosognosia and overvalued ideation look like nothing, quite honestly. It makes it look like mild.\n",
      "Interviewer: I mean it's interesting for me as a--so, somebody who's not in this field at all--to think about hoarding disorder because in a sense it's unique in two respects. One is it's a disorder that you can't really diagnose from the patient's body or even from their, like an examination of their mind or their speech, it requires external objects to diagnose and I can't think of another disorder that requires something truly external to the patient to have. And then it's maybe not unique in disorders in that the insight problem exists for many psychiatric disorders, where people will deny that they have a problem, but I think this quality of the disorder is distressing to others is also a way that hoarding is weirdly kind of external to the patient themselves. That when clinicians in these interviews talk about distress, they often talk about other people's distress other than the patient's. The patient's spouse, the patient's family, or you know that kind of society at large is distressed, and the patient themselves is the one who is kind of being told that they fit this distress criteria, but often it's the distress of others that is driving them in or is what's really happening. And I don't know I guess I'm just trying to get your thoughts on that on why you think, in this particular case, insight is kind of a problem in that way or why it's having this kind of strange externalizing effect?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, well I think wherever you have something that is egosyntonic, it's not surprising. True in other conditions, right, so if something feels consistent and right and good, even if there is...intrapsychically if it feels consistent and right and good, evidence from the external world then is what creates the dissonance or ambivalence at best, which then of course can be explored and enhanced, leading potentially to some motivational change. But I think the quality of the fact that these objects are often for people with hoarding where they have their primary relationship, they are where they spend most of their time, they are the source of their identity and good feelings about themselves, and so in the same way that we think about being in a relationship with another person who others might be able to judge from the outside and say, \"Oh I wish you wouldn't hang out with that person, they're not good for her\" that person doesn't feel that distress. They enjoy that relationship, they enjoy that experience, they're getting whatever they're getting from that relationship and I think the relationship with the objects is very similar here.\n",
      "Interviewer: That's interesting, like having an abusive relationship with objects.\n",
      "Interviewee: I'm sorry?\n",
      "Interviewer: So there was this interesting paper that Randy Frost published which broke the concept of insight down into different constructs, and I'd just like to read them to you and have you comment on how you encounter these different sorts of insight, if you think that some are more relevant than others? So the first one is defensiveness, the second one is anosognosia, which is where you're unable to even perceive your illness or that anything is wrong or causing you distress, the third one is overvalued ideation, and that's kind of believing that your items are more valuable than they truly are, and the last one is indifference. Do any of these, all of these seem like they're relevant for your patients? Is there one that you think is more important or less important?\n",
      "Interviewee: I certainly think the defensiveness is the one that resonates the most. That's something we just see day in and day out, even from folks that are willing to work with us and I think a lot of it seems to come from the fear that we're not gonna understand their stuff or value their stuff and that we're gonna judge them. They know that the system overall can be very punitive, and so what we find is once we make it clear that we're not gonna take their stuff because that's not our role, or tell them what to do, that they have control of their stuff no matter what, the defensiveness seems to break down. A lot of it really seems to be very fear-based.\n",
      "Interviewer: Um, when you encounter people who have this disorder and have very low insight, would you say that they truly don't know that there's anything different about them or their lives than other people? That they're truly bling to the fact that they have something about them that's different? Or is it more that they don't acknowledge that that difference is a problem?\n",
      "Interviewee: It feels like they know that not everybody else sees their stuff in their situation the way that they do, and aren't able to see the reasons that that might be a problem. I don't think it's willful disobedience or willful avoidance in most cases, but in some cases sometimes it might be. You know, I think a lot of it is all centered around perception and ability to kind of do the analysis that is required to have accurate perception.\n",
      "Interviewer: So would you say that when one of those individuals looks at their space, that they can't see how cluttered it is? That they see a normal space, even when it's clearly not normal?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well normal for them at least. You know, I think they can't see the health and safety issues and the volume in the same way that the rest of us would see.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you feel like that's just because they're so used to it or do you feel like that's almost in the level of like a delusion?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it's hard for me to know sometimes. There are certainly some people where they just do not see it, and then there are some people where they might say, \"Oh it's a little bit messy but it's not that bad.\" as we're looking at something that's fairly severe. And so, you know, I generally don't think that it's avoidance as much as it is sometimes it feels like the brain's not giving them accurate data to work with.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, kind of the same sort of difficulty judging the importance or prioritizing in speech as they might have with objects.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, now I'd like to talk about the criteria in the DSM which says, \"This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them.\" So, I guess I'm wondering how you asses that kind of degree of distress associated with discarding? Especially because people might deny distress, so it may be purely hypothetical distress, so they might be more distressed at their behavior--I guess first of all, how do you make that assessment?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so when discussing about what to discard, if clients have difficulty knowing where to start of what items to discard. So, they may look at like a newspaper from 10 years ago the same as they would a brand new book. So, they don't know what to discard, they have no starting point so when they start to think about discarding you can tell by body language that they're having difficulty even deciding what item to pick up and then getting distressed when thinking about what to do with it. So, it's not just about like, \"I'm gonna get rid of...in this table I'm gonna pick up all the garbage and throw the garbage away,\" but what is garbage and what isn't garbage. So, I think that is a distress because when they try to make a decision, they just kind of shut down and they can't make that decision. So, they have difficulty knowing where to start, and then the anxiety that they get. So, a lot of times they'll do self-talk like, \"well I guess I could get rid of this,\" or \"I could use this for this\" or you know, they can't really make that one decision quickly. They have to kind of go through the motions of what if. They always talk about what ifs, and I know they're starting to get distressed when they're thinking about all the possibilities. When they're trying to make a decision it's, \"what could go wrong.\" They start catastrophizing, you know, \"if I got rid of this item,\" kind of think about the worst possible thing that could happen, instead of just, \"I'm getting rid of it and then it's out of my head.\" And then they will start to ruminate on the possibility that they made a mistake if they do make a decision, so that's kind of how I measure distress. They may not say, \"I[m distressed\" or that they have difficulty, but the length of time even to make a decision is telling.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you have patients that deny that they would be distressed if they discarded? So, you're sitting with a patient and you say, \"Well if you were to throw out this news paper, would it distress you?\" And they would say, \"No, I would be fine throwing it out,\" do you have that interaction with patients? Or is it--\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: How do you feel with that? How do you kind of push on that? Do you ask them to then discard it, or?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, basically.\n",
      "Interviewer: Good to know. So now we’re going to talk about the how. So how the video will look like. We have 3 options of artistic styles. 1 being the line art option, 2 being vector art, and 3 being the comic art blended with live action, and so I’ll give you a second to look through them and have some questions for you later. You can let me know when you’ve looked through them and understand them- the concept of all three of them.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so before we get started on that, I have to ask you: are there any cartoons or animated movies that you personally like? Try to list them off, what are some of them?\n",
      "Speaker: Sure. Well we’re a big animation fam so of course, Disney and Pixar. We actually have a lot of anime as well. Anything from Pokémon to Avatar.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you’re big on animation?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah. Our family is, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: So all of the above?\n",
      "Speaker: Pretty much.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so based on the styles you see, the three options, which one would you choose? Which one do you like the most, more so?\n",
      "Speaker: Personally? Or which one do I think should be used in a video for kids?\n",
      "Interviewer: Personally.\n",
      "Speaker: Personally, I like line art best of these three.\n",
      "Interviewer: Line art. Why does it appeal to you the most?\n",
      "Speaker: Simplified. Gets the point across. It’s just less distracting.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so it’s clear and concise. It sounds like you had two options…\n",
      "Speaker: Vector art would be the second.\n",
      "Interviewer: Vector art would be your second option? Okay, so it sounds like you had two options: you had a personal option and one for children if you could choose that one. So which one would you choose for children if you had the option?\n",
      "Speaker: They’d probably take better to vector art.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay and why do you think that is?\n",
      "Speaker: It’s more common to what they see. They don’t see a lot of the line art. The doodles and stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, that’s good to know. What do you think the take home messages from the video should be?\n",
      "Speaker: Trying to get them excited about coming. It has to be honest, that it’s not easy, like there’s going to be work to it, but it’s all worth it to give it a try.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sounds good, and is there anything you feel like I missed? Anything important that I haven’t asked about that you feel we need to take into account?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t think so. I mentioned the whole confidentiality part, because kids are often afraid to say something. I can’t think of anything else.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, well that’s it. After this…\n",
      "Interviewer: So based off that, what do you think is important for other patients to know about anxiety and CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Just in general… that it can be all encompassing, that it takes commitment, time. It’s not just a cure and it goes away. You learn coping strategies and you still work on it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you tell me if there are any specific skills or areas that CBT targets?\n",
      "Speaker: Not specifically that I know of, I can make a guess.\n",
      "Interviewer: Try your best.\n",
      "Speaker: We talk a lot about taking the hardship of it, being involved in it himself. [8:38]____ phase hardship a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about thoughts? Or feelings or actions? Do you feel that CBT targets this area? How you heard anything about that in sessions?\n",
      "Speaker: They bring me in at the end, and sometimes he has something to say specifically. [8:58]___ that it’s hard to address something, if we can put it into words, talking through it all.\n",
      "Interviewer: Are there any questions that you wish you’d asked before you started the CBT sessions?\n",
      "Speaker: Not that I can think of. Not that I remember.\n",
      "Interviewer: What was your involvement in CBT? So, what does your involvement look like within the sessions when you come in here?\n",
      "Speaker: He goes pretty much weekly. Depending on his session, they want us both there first. Sometimes it’s just him then they bring me in for my view as well. Sometimes it matches, sometimes it does not. So they want to make sure we’re on the same track. We review what they had been working on for the week. They give him homework, tasks to complete. Just being a part of that, one, because I can give input to how [10:09] ____ and two, I’m hearing about what they’re saying. Otherwise, he just leaves and he says he doesn’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it’s helpful, sounds like.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes. Because then I can say, “Well what did they same about that?” and he can remember what she said, because I heard it too. It’s not bad. It’s just being a tween child and some of it is that there’s a lot of information to take in.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, knowing that, what do you think would be useful for other parents to know, from your experiences?\n",
      "Speaker: Just making sure that you’re open about it all. Put your cards on the table kind of thing. If they don’t have the whole picture, it’s hard to make any progress.\n",
      "Interviewer: So what do you think parents also need to know about sessions and how they work and\n",
      "Speaker: That you will be involved with it as well, it’s not just your child; it’s a team effort.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s good. Have you ever read or heard about any scientific research about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Not that I can think of.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so if not, do you believe it’s something we should talk about in the videos that we are going to be constructing?\n",
      "Speaker: Probably. I mean, is it geared toward the parent or the child or both?\n",
      "Interviewer: I believe it will be geared towards both.\n",
      "Speaker: ____\n",
      "Interviewer: Not really sure how it will turn out, but just based off of you…\n",
      "Speaker: Just major statistics or something that benefit… just to show there’s science behind it… the reason why you should participate.\n",
      "Interviewer: Good to know. Did you know about somebody else’s experience with CBT prior to sessions here?\n",
      "Speaker: Prior to sessions here, yeah, my oldest child.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so your oldest child had CBT, that was the approach used with your oldest child?\n",
      "Speaker: One of them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Was it a positive or negative experience overall?\n",
      "Speaker: It was positive.\n",
      "Interviewer: Based off of that what do you think would be useful to know, based off your previous experience with one of your children?\n",
      "Speaker: Just that there is hope in it, and that you can get help through it, that they’ll help you work through it one step at a time.\n",
      "Interviewer: And it sounds like maybe unlike a typical clinician, for you what's really important is making the person safe to live in the home and what's causing the behavior is almost less important than that. I mean if they have, for instance, obsessive compulsive disorder other than hoarding, if their house is full of stuff for you the primary thing to deal with is the house. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Correct, you know and doing the work to teach them the skills so that they can maintain it moving forward. We have a very low recidivism rate because our approach is regardless of what might be going on, if there is a different diagnosis that would be clinically given, that's less what we're worried about. We're really worried about teaching them the skills so that they can not only reduce the volume of their housing, but maintain it moving forward.\n",
      "Interviewer: One of the things I asked you about in the listing portion of the interview was about how you could tell if somebody had hoarding disorder. I'm wondering if in your mind as somebody who works with these individuals a lot, there's kind of like a soft set of criteria or a typical description of a person with hoarding disorder? Do you feel like if you were to describe a person with hoarding disorder without actually talking about their stuff, that like a cohesive description of that person would emerge? Does that make sense as a question?\n",
      "Interviewee: It does, and you know it would be so hard to do because all of our folks are really kind of different in terms of our, if you look at our data folks tend to be single, tend to be in their 50s or 60s, our folks have an average income of 13,000. That's because our program is primarily geared to work with lower income folks who are kind of most vulnerable around housing situations. But overall it's interesting because they're actually much better educated than our group in Boston, which is a fairly well-educated population. So, you know, I think it's tough to make some generalities without kind of looking at their particular relationships with the stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess I'm, I don't know, sometimes when I ask for that list, even with clinicians I get this kind of very kind of personality-based description. You know, like somebody who's really scattered, who's very vivacious and talks a lot, and I'm wondering if that resonated with you as to the people that you see, that they kind of have this typical manner of being?\n",
      "Interviewee: It's interesting because you say that and in some of the folks that description is very very accurate, and then there's a lot of folks where that wouldn't be accurate at all, that they're very kind of hyper-organized and very quiet or very exacting. And so, I would feel really uncomfortable actually making a generality.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, that's exactly, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: Because we see such a wide range in terms of personalities. I think the thing that is much more consistent is the themes around why people hold onto their stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: Awesome. So moving on to how it’s going to look, so we’re still toying with the idea. We do have this right here has 3 different options of potential kind of [21:51] ___. So you can take a second and we’ll go over that, and I’m just curious of what your impressions of those 3 options are, like if there’s one that particularly stands out to you or you really hate one. There aren’t necessarily the only things. These are heavy contenders, basically.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yeah, not sure quite what I get from the one in the middle. Kind of getting this idea of something kind of beyond what’s inside of you. You want to think about too much math on the right. The one in the middle is a little cleaner I guess is kind of my first thought looking at it. The one on the left has got a lot going on there in terms of the picture.\n",
      "Interviewer: _____ variation on the line art side of things.\n",
      "Speaker: right, on the side of it on that, the people are all about the same\n",
      "Interviewer: How about on the second page I think transitions a little bit more to a cartoony style.  [22:55] ___ kids, but what are your thoughts kind of on that style?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know, I’m kind of big on the carton. Maybe the one in the middle. Maybe part of it is it’s easier to relate yourself to a cartoon than it is to… it’s hard to get a generic looking person. It’s a little harder to relate to a person when you’re looking at a picture. The cartoons, I think, have the advantage [23:24] ____\n",
      "Interviewer: Right. How about for like a parent video? How do you feel about doing a cartoony style like option 2?\n",
      "Speaker: Parents are different, right. For me, I grew up watching cartoons Saturday morning, so that was also my perspective on it, and I watch a few more now because they’re a little more mainstream, but um, I think they could relate.\n",
      "Interviewer: Again, I just wanted to thank you for participating in the research, and thank you for being with us today. Of course, you know what the CARTOONS study is about. Basically, we are creating educational videos describing what cognitive behavioral therapy is, it’s the kind of therapy that your child is receiving here, and cognitive behavioral therapy is so long, it’s such a tongue twister to really say, we’re going to be saying CBT, just to help out real quick with that. So to start out, please tell me what comes to mind when you first think about CBT? There’s no right answer.\n",
      "Speaker: As the parent of the child in it?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, from your perspective. From what you know. I’m sure you’ve sat in on some sessions or he has homework and stuff like that, so just tell us, from your perspective, there’s no right or wrong answer, what you think CBT is.\n",
      "Speaker: Having help from somebody else to work through whatever issues you’re facing.\n",
      "Interviewer: When you sat in on the session, do you remember a time where you were explained to exactly what the treatment would look like or anything like that with CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Well, what goals they were going to work on, yes, not really in what way.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Could you tell me what you know about CBT in your own words, how would you explain what CBT is, if someone were to ask you?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know a lot of specifics. It’s just good to have a professional, someone who’s not directly involved in the situation. They tend to give more worth to somebody else’s opinion, the child does, versus just mom or dad telling them what to do.\n",
      "Interviewer: When you first learned about the kind of therapy we do here, do you remember what questions you had for the therapist?\n",
      "Speaker: Not really. We had an experience previously where he basically refused to even speak. So it was like, “How was that going to work? How do you handle that?”\n",
      "Interviewer: And are you involved in diagnosing people with hoarding disorder, treating them, or research or all of the above or none of the above?\n",
      "Interviewee: So we don't do diagnosis. We're less worried about the mental health diagnosis, our goal is to provide case management intervention so that people aren't losing their homes. And so, if you think about treatment more broadly and less kind of clinically, you know I guess you could make an argument that that what we're doing, that our focus is not on the mental health side, it's on the social service intervention side. In addition to that, we've partnered with [INSTITUTION 8:03] to do some research because we have a very large data base of information that we've collected over the years, to better understand the problem of hoarding as we see it in the community so that we can have a better response in terms of housing stability and eviction prevention.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how long have you worked with these individuals?\n",
      "Interviewee: Since 2006.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, now we're gonna talk a little bit about the diagnosis of hoarding and we have some questions, which we kind of use with clinicians but I'm really curious to your encounters with them and your ideas about them, so if you don't feel like these pertain particularly to you that's okay. The first one is kind of broad, so in your mind, what do you think are the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps somebody who is a collector of items, and somebody with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Good question, I think there are a couple of different things. I think that the volume of possessions certainly is one. You know, with collectors, generally speaking they're able to display things, you could still use the homes and the rooms, the spaces for their intended purpose and I think when we think about hoarding, that impairment of the ability to use the space and the real risk of it in terms of health, safety and well-being is a bigger factor, so I think that that's the big kind of difference there that we see.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it's more about the home use itself and whether the person's space usage is impaired?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah that's a big part of it, and you know I think the emotional attachment is different. I think for people with hoarding based on our experience, there's a lot of worry about what happens to the items if they're not being used, there's a lot of worry about the person collecting the items, their individual emotional and physical well-being if they didn't have the items, and so I think that that's also distinct form what you would see from a collector. It's a much more personalized attachment.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like there's two kind of main distinguishing factors for you. One is that unlike collecting, in individual with hoarding disorder's space will be kind of difficult or dangerous to use. And then the second one is that they'll have a much more kind of intense, maybe fear-based emotional response to their item? Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, along with, you know not just fear-based, but an inability to separate out their identity, potential identity, all of those kind of emotions from the physical objects themselves.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, and do you feel--I'm assuming that you've encountered also individuals that have problems with animal hoarding, because of your role. Is that correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like that's different for those individuals?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, we don't have that many cases that come across every year so it's sort of hard to tell.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewee: There's certainly a different level of attachment to the animals and an inability, when there's poor animal care, to be able to see it that feels a little bit different from object hoarding, but certainly that's not...again, we don't see that many so it's sort of hard for me to say.\n",
      "Interviewer: When you think about the individuals that you've encountered with this disorder, do you have any sense for how long the behavior's been going on before you see them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Certainly for most of our folks, decades. You know, dating back to late teens, early twenties.\n",
      "Interviewer: And I guess just as you encounter these individuals, do you think that it's like a progressive illness that gets worse with age, or do you see it more as a set of circumstances? So like, as a person ages they naturally become more socially isolates, their children might leave home, they might inherit things from their parents, they might have a fixed income, and that those are the things that make it get worse as they get older?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, we're not seeing people who are going out and actively acquiring all the time later in life, especially since they're frail, it feels like it's more of a, when you think about how much stuff builds up over a course of decades if you're not able to get rid of it, either through active acquiring or through things like junk mail that just come into our lives, it feels like it's more of a slow slide off of a slippery slope than anything else. It just kind of builds up and builds up and builds up.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, maybe it's more that the stuff has built up rather than the behavior has gotten recently worse?\n",
      "Interviewee: Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well those are all my questions, I really appreciate your time today.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I think that would be helpful.  I mean I think that would also depend on the skill of the practitioner. Unrelated thing, my older son wasn’t treated here a long time ago… you know had a run with CBT and it worked. It was more difficult for him. So I think it sort of depends on… it can be dependent on the skill of the practitioner or it may also be dependent on the individual child and how difficult it is to them to deal with so. Yeah, but I think understanding that it is not going to solely an unpleasant experience both for the child and the parent. I think it is helpful. Although again, I think there has to be some realistic expectations, and I mean I guess it also depends on the CBT whether how much they are going to have an expectation that the parent is going to be involved. I think often… therapy is relatively limited and you are going to have to have more outside parental involvement. So I think that can be challenging for parents. It can be difficult to them to put their child in that situation. It is unpleasant for them. So um yeah… it goes against sort of your parental instincts. So I think that can be a challenge that kind of needs to be made clear to parents. That sometimes you are going to be asked or told to do things that are not what you would think, you know. Protecting your child is not always… the best way to move forward. I mean I guess the other thing is consistency…. And um yeah providing consistency because I think that’s important and I think that’s really hard, especially when you are dealing with two different parents. I don’t know. I think that’s getting off topic… I think yeah it’s obviously very helpful to have parents understand what the processes as well as the child. What are the things that they are going to have to confront as they go forward and I don’t know?\n",
      "Interviewer:  Well what would you are some of those things that they would have to confront? Like what… you were giving some good advice to kind of parent in terms of what to expect, but are there any sorts of specific types of things you’d say would be really useful kind of like as heads-up when some is first entering therapy, like what they should know of in order to be successful.\n",
      "Speaker: Well I think that the point about… that you are going to… the therapy may contradict your parental instincts. I think that’s important for parents to know. Yeah I mean I think you would have to be able to sit also with your child’s anxiety as well I guess which is similar to that. I think that it’s helpful to know that it will work, you know and I think ….  I think having something about that it at least for some cases it, it is most effective therapy. What else, umm… yeah it’s not going to be always unpleasant. That’s the other thing is sort of the kids are quite are happy too, and they make progress. So I think that’s in some cases true, depends on the child I guess. Umm yeah I don’t know. That’s everything I would probably say.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, literature on hoarding disorder kind of says it tends to be older people who are people with hoarding problems, and I guess I'm wondering do you feel like it's because it's a progressive disorder, so it worsens with age, maybe with cognitive decline? Or do you feel like that's more related to their life course in terms of their parents have died, they've inherited things, their children have left their home, or their spouses died, or they've gotten divorced and now they--it's not that the behavior necessarily has gotten worse so much as their life has changed to the point that the management of objects has gotten out of control? Like due to mobility issues just with having a house and accumulating stuff within it, or maybe both?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both but I think it's usually, like for my clients I have clients that are 18 to 90-something years old, and I think that all of the older clients can talk about that they did have some of the behaviors and the tendencies until something happened, and I think it's accumulation of the objects or major stressors that have caused backsliding. You know, they often will talk about how they tried to manage it or that they tried to keep things clear and they tried to work on their discarding, and then something else has happened. So I think when they're adults there's also accumulation of stuff, the life events that have happened, they're also accumulating a lot of the times stuff of their children or grandchildren that lived in their home, they're also dealing with major life stressors that may be contributing to the difficulties that they're having. They also have mobility and other health issues that are involved, so they can't do the same things that they used to do like move things around or get rid of things. They may not be driving, but I think that it may not be that the actual hoarding or the actual feelings or attachment has gotten worse with older adults, I think it's accumulation of what's happened in their life. Like the life events and the accumulation of items, because my clients that are 18 can talk about items the same way and have the same feelings as somebody in their 80s. And usually the older adults don't have the outside influence of their parents or spouse or partner, roommates that are stopping them from over cluttering. You know, they're usually living alone or they're in their own space so that they're able to accumulate in a way. They're not having like that outside influence.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like the impulse may be the same, but it's a lot of social factors that turn it into a bigger problem for older adults. So, younger people might have hoarding behavior and might have the kind of ideation that goes along with it. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes. In some cases I do have some younger clients that they are having, like their houses are so filled that they can't use spaces and would meet the DSM diagnosis, but they also have other factors too like they do have health issues. They may have fibromyalgia, they may have IBS or some other medical issues that make it difficult for them to manage everything.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well I really appreciate your time today, that's the last question that I had.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, so I guess that leads us really nicely into the next part of the interview because in the kind of next question is, you know, for this last criteria the difficulty is due to a perceived need to save and distress associated with discarding, I wonder how that is a part of the problem of insight. So, how does that distress manifest in somebody who just doesn't have insight into their disorder and how do you make a judgement as to whether they're not meeting criteria for hoarding disorder because they're not distressed, versus they do have hoarding disorder but they just don't have insight into the disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, that's a good question, I mean that's pretty hard, that's a hard call to make. I think ultimately I would look at if there isn't the distress, the subjective distress, I guess trying to find like is there impairment, is there functional impairment related to that perceived need to save and the difficulty discarding. So, if the person isn't impacted, if it isn't interfering even if the person is saying it's not really stressful or causing distress, but is it interfering to a significant degree and trying to speak or talk to the person about that. Like for example, one of the individuals I worked with who the county was threatening eviction, he didn't see any problem with his difficulty. He didn't experience distress, either related to that perceived need to save or the difficulty discarding. Well he did, but he didn't subjectively identify that as a problem, and so he had decided that there was distress when he was deciding to get rid of things, so he would keep them, and the excessive acquisition brought pleasure for him or it was something that he enjoyed doing, so the only piece that led to the impairment was someone from the outside saying that he had a problem. But they had power so they were the one threatening eviction, and so then even though he didn't have insight into his disorder, he didn't have insight into the difficulty. It actually had caused a lot of problems with his relationships, like he was estranged from his whole family but he didn't have insight that the hoarding was a part of that really, and so really the only area--he did agree with the fact that yeah this is causing distress and I will be impaired if I don't have a home to live in, I won't be able to do anything if I don't have a home, and so at that point, the diagnosis was still warranted because of the situation and because of the distress around that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, a lot of it is sentimental value like, well various items and stuff that I’ve had from my youth or stuff that was handed down to me or things that I collect like, you know, “Say I like Led Zeppelin so I collected all the.. He put out a new album several years ago, so I collected all that, and I have a few books, and or say other books that I have about cartooning or Disney or something like that.\n",
      "18:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, and which things are most important to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, photographs first of all; family photographs. The art in files and things that I’ve done all through the years like the stuff on my computer. And my phone! And then stuff that you can’t really replace like stuff you’ve been given or that kind of stuff, or stuff you’ve collected that is hard to replace, certain T shirts or something like that.\n",
      "19:03 Interviewer:\n",
      "Alright so irreplaceable items, family photos, those are what you hold close.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "19:11 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and are there parts of your home that you don’t use? I know that you’ve mentioned that front room that you have or are there parts of your home that aren’t used in the way that they’re supposed to be used?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well for sure the front room isn’t used the way it’s supposed to be used, but I use it a lot. I’m out here a lot. Not really.\n",
      "19:38 Interviewer:\n",
      "Like the kitchen is used for cooking, the bathtub, and stuff like that…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, all that stuff is used, yeah. It’s not cluttered so much that… the kitchen is pretty okay. It’s a little cluttered, but it’s fully usable and so is the bathroom. Yeah, it’s mostly the front room here.\n",
      "19:57 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so one room of just clutter then.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "20:01 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so now this section of questions is about how you value your possessions. So I know that you mentioned that your pictures and your files are what you hold most dear, but when you think about all of your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Mostly either the things that you can’t replace or… oh yeah the files are included because that’s all years and years and years of work which is like artwork or things that I value. Yeah, so the most difficult ones are, you know, your photos which are family things, which you can’t just buy; you can’t replace them.\n",
      "20:52 Interviewer:\n",
      "Irreplaceable memories.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "20:56 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so what do you consider trash? I know you mentioned getting rid of things is hard for you, but what type of items do you discard?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. Um looking at the subject matter what they will be talking about. What do you think will be the most impactful subject in terms of what type of things will be spoken in the video?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know. I mean I think it will be important to have a range of issues and different types of issues and different [28:17] ___.  And I think that it is important to have arc and kind of showing how individuals sort of are able to progress and you know how they felt before, where they’re going, and you know how they felt about the process along the way. So I think those are important. I don’t know how much time you have umm yeah. So I think a variety of ages. I think you know things that are… you know I would have a range of concerns from common to quite unusual.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like there should be breathe in terms of what’s spoken about and also like as you mentioned arc, more of a story rather than just information being thrown kind of at the viewer. That’s what I’m hearing.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I think an arc is helpful because at least it says ok you know it doesn’t necessarily have to be a completed arc and I think in some ways that often would be important not say this is done, but ok this is what it was like before. It was really difficult. This is what we did, you know. This is how the parents helped and dealt with it. This is where we are know, you know. Go forward from here whatever. So not… I think that’s helpful right I mean because…. I think if you just talk about the process and not show what the outcomes are it won’t be very helpful.\n",
      "Speaker: Did you see my text? .... No you were busy. I have faculty meeting tonight [30:18] ___ so I cannot do dinner. You can come down and get dinner for you and [NAME REDACTED]. They offered and you can take a plate home for [NAME REDACTED] if you want, but I have a faculty meeting. I’m sorry, I’m sorry [NAME REDACTED].\n",
      "30: 31 Interviewer: I’m transcribing so it’s fine.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Or our RAs are transcribing so\n",
      "Speaker: So...\n",
      "Speaker: Well then\n",
      "Speaker: I apologize, but there is food downstairs if you would like to have a plate.\n",
      "Speaker: Well I’ll ask [NAME REDACTED] what he wants to do.\n",
      "Speaker: OK thanks. Bye.\n",
      "Interviewer: One last question about the what in the video. In terms about talking how CBT works, do you think that’s something that’s a good thing to put in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I think not detailed you know, but I think sort of…. You know illustrations on how anxiety levels go up and then repeated exposures can decrease. I think things like that are helpful kind of just explain to them what the overall theories and ideas are. I think that would be helpful to give them some, you know idea what the process is and what to expect, you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: and um in...\n",
      "Speaker: and that everything is going to be different depending on the individuals and anxiety.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right. Sounds like a lot of that is you know something you said throughout kind of like it is very individualized for different people and it varies. Not one size fits all. In terms of how the video should look, we have a few different styles I just want you to take a look at and I’m curious if there is any one, there’s just three of them, if there’s any one in particular that stands out more than the others, or one that you really don’t like.\n",
      "Speaker: What, what is it you are trying to do.\n",
      "Interviewer: So this one the first option would be line art. So it would be pretty live-action and then it would have people able to draw, and there would be special effects where we can digitally alter it so people look like they are drawing things and [32:49]__  different line arts. So that’s the first option.\n",
      "Interviewer: So I'm gonna ask you now just to talk through with me some of the diagnosis criteria. Before we begin, I just want to know if any of the elements in the criteria in the DSM-V you find particularly difficult to apply or subjective or that you wonder if different clinicians might apply differently? Does anything jump out to you from the DSM-V?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah sure, sure. Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think ultimately the DSM runs pretty well, you know, that the heart of this diagnosis has to do with that perceived need to save and that difficulty upon attempting to discard, so that distress associated with discarding and that perceived need to save. I think that's at the heart of it and I think the DSM does outline that. I think the one criteria I might have some issue with, not necessarily issue with but might signify expanding upon is this idea that the home needs to be cluttered to a level where the spaces are compromised. I think that when we think about the internet and I already mentioned digital acquiring and difficulty discarding of digital items like individuals could be engaged in a lot of excessive acquiring of digital material and maybe also that also might be the difficulty discarding of digital material might actually be impacting someone in a negative way, right? It might actually be impairing their function and enjoyment in domains of their life, and that could be something that the DSM doesn't really talk about. If an individual is just--if their symptoms are just associated with digital clutter and acquisition and difficulty discarding, that would be something that the DSM doesn't address and it wouldn't be hoarding disorder, so you would have to try to, I mean I'm not sure what you would diagnose. And ultimately that could be one point issue.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, interesting. So, now I have a couple of questions that deal with the specific diagnostic criteria, and I know that that's not really how you look at this problem, but I still want to kind of think through these issues with you. So, the first one is about value and when we talked about what distinguishes a person who has hoarding disorder from somebody who's a collector, you mentioned that the person with hoarding disorder their space will be much more kind of impacted and unusable, and I'm wondering if in your mind the value of the items saved is relevant to whether or not somebody has hoarding disorder? So, could you be a person with hoarding disorder who exclusively saves one kind of item in the same way a collector might? You know, like you can imagine somebody's house is totally filled with like cuckoo clocks to the point that they can't use it, but that's all they save.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yup, you know and I think one of the interesting things is that they've taken the definition has changed around hoarding over the years. You know, the language around the definition used to say, \"Items that have little or no value,\" you know, but what we know is that people hoard all kinds of really nice stuff and really not nice stuff and I think a lot of it goes back to beauty is in the eye of the beholder. We certainly see people who hoard all of one thing, and sometimes it looks completely like trash to me and sometimes I can totally understand the value. I think when we think about value, I'm much more concerned about what's the value to the client that I'm working with, less about the finical value because we have people who hoard, you know the guy who has 15 or 20,0000 toothpaste caps, and for him they're extremely valuable, for me they would be trash. And so I think it's important that we as professionals are really careful about how we think about value.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, for you what's relevant really to telling if somebody has hoarding disorder is not what they're saving or how objectively valuable it is, more that their stuff is impairing their life. So, you could hoard valuable art and if your house was unusable, it would still be hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, for the most part.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, for the most part.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhmm, that inflexibility.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so I think that does maybe overlap some. I think maybe the difference in hoarding disorder or anxiety disorder or OCD is that, at least from the folks I've seen, it's not as fixed I guess. The overvalued ideation is there, but there's like enough flexibility in most people to try things differently. Unless there's like a comorbid OCPD or something there and then that might make things harder and that might have more to do with the comorbid diagnosis interacting with the treatment. But I think if that isn't there and it's just some overvalued ideation related to that perceived need to save, I think I would look at how fixed are their beliefs and are there--is it that the person is just really scared and there's a lot of anxiety? That could be the case so that they think that might be the case, or is it just like 100% just the way that it is, there's no arguing it. And with a delusion you never argue a delusion anyway, but there's no approaching it in any way shape or form. Most people I've worked with will at least approach it and will talk about it like, \"Oh yeah, I can see that's a strong value, I can see how I really think that I am contributing to the plastic thing in the ocean; however I'm also seeing that if I do this this way, I'm never going to be able to get through all these papers, you know, I'm never going to be able to do this if I do it 100% right all the time\" so maybe there's some flexibility that's incorporated, even though I still strongly believe that I want to be an environmentally conscious person and I want to for the most part just try to think appropriately and recycle and then that's where I would see there's like some flexibility and it's not completely like, \"I have to do it this way and we're not doing it any differently\" and I think that might be one piece that might help.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, I want to acknowledge that we're definitely at an hour, I have three more questions for you, do you mind sticking with it for three more questions?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, not at all, that's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer: How long have these kinds of, for the patients you tend to see, how long has the behavior typically been doing on when you see them? Do you have any sense of that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well on average from my experience, they've had these saving behaviors, the difficulty discarding for a long long period of time, probably as long as they can remember. They remember childhood and having some behaviors, but it hasn't gotten to the point where it's been a problem or that they've recognized or someone else has noticed as being a problem. Usually they can tell me about some big event that happened like loss of their family and they've inherited some things and they've ended up having so many things that it became overwhelming and they just kind of gave up on managing it. So, usually they've been managing it, you know they've always had a little bit too much stuff but something has prompted them to stop managing it, and then it became out of control like a health issue, or caring for a family member, or loss of the family member, some big event. It's not always like that, but generally they talk about having these behaviors for like their life.\n",
      "Interviewer: If someone were to ask you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life, how would you respond to that, from what you’ve learned from this process?\n",
      "Speaker: High levels of anxiety can definitely hinder your ability to interact with others, or maybe overreact to help what people say to you. So it can definitely hinder your ability to fully function.\n",
      "Interviewer: What do you think is important for other patients to know about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: It’s not painful.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you elaborate more on that?\n",
      "Speaker: I’m not super familiar on how the therapy goes on that, but what I understand is it is something that will help you to understand yourself better.\n",
      "Interviewer: So are you saying you’re not as familiar with maybe the mechanisms?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I’m not really familiar with the mechanisms of how it’s done.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right. Are there things you wish you knew, like in terms of how CBT operates, do you wish you had more knowledge on that?\n",
      "Speaker: I guess so, yeah. It would probably be useful if I knew more about how it works. Maybe how a typical session might run.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay so like the structure of a normal session, of what that looks like. You think that would be useful information for other people to see as well?\n",
      "3:59: Speaker: I do.\n",
      "Interviewer: What would you want to tell someone who’s just starting CBT? Is there any piece of advice you would give them, whether it be someone who’s going in themselves or… we’ll just start with that- someone going in for themselves.\n",
      "Speaker: I definitely believe mental health is very important, just generally. If you were sick, physically sick, I mean you wouldn’t think much about going to the doctor, and they give you something to try- I mean we would try pretty much anything that they would suggest if we thought it would help. So CBT, from what I understand is something that has been successful. You know, people have had success in improving their mental health, so I would highly recommend trying it.\n",
      "Interviewer: In terms of you’ve heard it’s successful, have you encountered anything from a scientific perspective? Have you encountered scientific articles or anything like that?\n",
      "Speaker: No, I have not. Nothing deeply scientifical.\n",
      "Interviewer: What would you want to tell parents, like if there was a parent of a child who was going to go into CBT? What would you want them to know?\n",
      "Speaker: I would think for me as a parent, sometimes it’s a little hard for me to understand what exactly is going on in the therapy, and I think sometimes you expect… not expect… I mean you could have really fast results, but I think you have to understand there’s a gradual process that does take time to go through, for a patient to work through.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it’s not necessarily an instant thing? As nice as that would be?\n",
      "Speaker: Right. It would be nice. I don’t know if adults, but it was proved that kids, it seems takes a while for kids to kind of get that relationship with a therapist. It would be nice if we were all really truthful when we went to the doctor. That was one of my favorite shows that I used to watch was Doctor House. Everybody lies- I hope that’s not true. I suspect for kids maybe it’s not that easy to be fully truthful in the beginning.\n",
      "Interviewer: If you had to think of or say three words that describe CBT to you, or three words that come to you head when you think of CBT, what would those words be?\n",
      "Speaker: Three words, okay. So it’d be like “Develop better habits.”\n",
      "Interviewer: ____ talked about earlier how you’re identifying things that may not be the most useful for yourself\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Like having an abusive relationship with objects.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, certainly one that is not fully healthy or supporting the person from, in all domains yes. And the, I think the insight piece is tricky because there is to some degree in many people who hoard recognition that they are not like other people. If this weren't true, shame wound't be present. If that wasn't true, there wouldn't be worry about stigma or inviting people in or fear of negative consequences. So, I think this insight piece is worthy of enormous amounts of research and exploration because it is not, for most people, entirely absent. The insight into the impairment, the functional impairment or the negative consequences for self might be more diminished, but for most people that I've encountered clinically, now hundreds of people with hoarding, this idea that they're not like others seems to be present at lest to some greater or lesser extent. So, that part of insight is a little trickier for me. How do we help people who have some awareness that they're not like others actually use that to either be able to articulate the distress that they feel, or to move them toward being more motivated--intrinsically motivated--for treatment?\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, I mean it really is a very interesting problem, particularly with hoarding disorder, and I think you are exactly right as to why because they do realize that they're different, it's just that they don't see their differentness as a problem and in some cases, in many cases, they see it almost as being a good thing, a thing that is better about them than other people.\n",
      "Interviewee: That's right, that other people just somehow don't understand the value of things in the way that they do, yep.\n",
      "Interviewer: And I mean, as a clinician it must be unusual to encounter people like that and to also at the same time see that they are exceptionally creative and that sometimes there's almost something cool about having a person who really sees value in objects and appreciates them in that way.\n",
      "Interviewee: That's right, that's right yeah for sure.\n",
      "Speaker: Um I don’t know…. I’m not totally fond of that idea.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, the second is more of what you would typically see as a cartoon. Something that you see, there are a lot of YouTube videos, instructional videos. That type of style.\n",
      "Speaker: Interesting. I don’t know I mean I guess I’m…. I don’t know. I guess I’m not necessarily overly excited about the idea of um… I don’t know potentially maybe the vector art. I don’t know I guess I’m just… I can understand that. I just don’t understand why you need the other things rather than just having individuals, children talk about it.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like more of just kind of like doing general filming without having special effects. Do you think it’s sufficient?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know. It certainly would be my preference.\n",
      "Interviewer: It would be your preference. Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: I mean if I’m looking at stuff. I think I just fine it. I don’t know distracting.\n",
      "Interviewer: ok, ummm what should the take home message of the videos be? Like if there was one thing to really emphasize.\n",
      "Speaker: Well I think the thing to take home is that it works and that it takes time…. You are not going to lose anything from trying. It is a collaboration between individual and parents and the you know the therapist. It’s not going to work out without all three being involved.\n",
      "35: 11 Interviewer: Ok! Is there anything you want to add in terms of wrapping up? Any last thing you think is important for us to know…\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t think I’m an average... I don’t think I’m uh… I think I have a larger role. I may know more than what most parents will know so I think that I have a skewed perspective.\n",
      "Interviewer: There is obviously going to be varying levels of parents and they come and go and it’s important getting all those different perspectives. Thanks so much for talking. I appreciate it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Thanks so much for meeting with me today. I’m part of research team that’s looking at Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, it’s the therapy that we do here at this clinic. With this project, we want to create some short educational videos talking about cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a mouthful, so I’m just going to refer to it as CBT throughout the video. Okay? So let’s start. Can you just kind of tell me what goes through your mind when you think about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Sorry we were joking about the stuff they sell at the gas station… So helping people to learn to recognize wrong thinking… or learning in a way to manage the way you think.\n",
      "Interviewer: So learning ways to manage how you think. So it sounds like there’s definitely a lot of… a lot of it is about thoughts, would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes. I would say yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: When you first learned about the kind of therapy we do here, did you have any questions about what it looked like?\n",
      "Speaker: I did not. I mean I had heard of it before.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. From where had you heard it from before?\n",
      "Speaker: When I first started hearing about it, it was after the Gulf War. It developed as a way to kind of help you deal with stress after post-traumatic stress and such. I’ve known others who have kind of used it as a way of therapy.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so have you had conversations with other people about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: A little bit, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: What information from them did you receive, about this treatment?\n",
      "Speaker: Not a whole lot other than the basic idea that it’s kind of helping a person recognize maybe when they’re not thinking correctly or helping recognizing experiencing symptoms that may be not quite right, like anxiety- you learn to recognize the symptoms of anxiety and learn how to manage those a little better.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so these are kind of broad level questions about big issues in hoarding disorder. So, there's this, we talked a little bit about cultural forces associating perhaps consumerism or environmentalism, I want to kind of explore that a little bit more, you know, do you feel like there's a relationship in the patients that you've seen between having had experiences of scarcity or poverty in the development of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhhm, yeah, good question. You know, anecdotally, I have had a couple patients talk about that and talk about that when they were younger or not having, yeah not having food or not necessarily having what they need, and so ultimately wanting to and kind of learning not to waste, right, talking about that sort of idea of like I shouldn't waste anything because there was a time that I didn't have anything and maybe in the future I might not have anything. Or like maybe something would happen, you know, like I'll need this and I'll be in hard times again. And actually one of the, like an interesting case example is, I can't remember his name, I think it was a Chinese artist who's mother struggled with hoarding, one second I'm just gonna look up the name of it. Oh, Song Dong, and so she was an artist and he grew up in China and his mother basically there was just like economic difficulties in China as he was--or as she was growing up, and so she learned basically to save and to not waste because of those difficulties, just in case that were to happen again. Like it was just kind of a value that she learned because of what was happening in society and that was a big part of her difficulty. It was rooted in her experience as a child and not having what she needed. I've heard that form many patients and not everybody for sure, but definitely some and there was this idea that, \"I don't want that to ever happen again or at least I want to do what I can to prevent that from happening if I ever were in a situation where I didn't have what I needed.\" I don't see that that often, but I have seen it a couple of times.\n",
      "Interviewer: Another really interesting example that I read about is an example of a couple, and maybe you've heard of this it's a pretty famous story, they lived in a very small apartment in New York city, which was entirely filled up with objects to the point that they couldn't use the space, they couldn't host people, they couldn't sit down in their own apartment. It just so happened that it was an art collection, and when they died it was an extremely valuable art collection that they had accumulated over the course of like 60 years of living in New York city and it was all donated to the MET and valued at like $6 million, but prior to them dying nobody was able to view the art, nobody was able to enter the apartment, it was basically an unlivable space. And I guess the question I have is does that count as hoarding disorder if they're hoarding appropriately valuable items in a small space that they can no longer use as an apartment?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, it's a very interesting question because in a way it doesn't meet that criteria of value. But for me, I guess what I'm articulating a lot here is my own weighting of those criteria, so that if it's causing interference in the ability to use their space for the purpose intended, regardless of the actual value, that other criteria weighs a bit heavier for me probably than the actual value. I find that a more subjective criteria in lots of ways.\n",
      "Interviewer: What for you, I mean, is it possible to have hoarding disorder and only to hoard certain kinds of objects the way that we might think of a collector? So, could you hoard, for example, cuckoo clocks or bird feeders, you know.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, definitely, I think you can. However, I think the difference is, like it's interesting that you mentioned cuckoo clocks because I've actually worked with an individual who loved cuckoo clocks and had several cuckoo clocks, but as we were doing our decluttering exercises, she was coming across one she hadn't seen in years and forgot she owned. So I think, you know, she loved cuckoo clocks and she had several, she even had one up on her wall actually; however, we were finding cuckoo clocks that she didn't even remember she had because they were lost in her clutter. And so, ultimately, you know, I think we could say she was collecting, and that was aesthetic, that was purely just loving cuckoo clocks and the way they look. And she loved Germany and she got several from Germany and things like that, so there might be some, maybe this can make it down to that sentimental value, too, so there might be some reasons why this person liked cuckoo clocks, but ultimately, yes I think that an individual can hoard one kind of item or a specific kind of item. However, I don't think it's limited to that. So like, this individual who loved cuckoo clocks also acquired a lot of other things, so it was more than just the cuckoo clocks and I think that's why this individual wasn't able to enjoy the cuckoo clocks in the way that someone who was just collecting them might, because she wasn't able to find them or retrieve them when she wanted to. Or even, you know, eventually folks might forget that they have some of these objects, right. So I think that with collecting, individuals mostly know like what items they have, they can pull them out and look at them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you think of a specific case or cases that was challenging for you to diagnose? Either, for a bunch of reasons, because it was on the border between pathological or non-pathological?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. Are there things you wish you knew of that either it took time for you to learn or you still may not know the answer to?\n",
      "Speaker: Well I think one of the things is that it’s not like a once and done sort of thing. That’s it’s an ongoing process. That even though you may deal with one particular anxiety that you know a very similar patters can arise in other so… it’s you know there could a whack-a-mole sense sometimes so it’s not like they are going to come in and get the course of CBT and they are going to get cured and their lives are going to be perfect from then on. So I think that it’s an ongoing process that and that you may need to come back for a tune up or whatever you deal with that. So I think understanding that it’s an ongoing process and you know yeah and that it will require active participation on the part of the parents. It’s not something like you just say here take care of my kid. It’s not how it works. It’s more like a partnership.  I think kind of explaining that and sort of the expectations of the parents. It not like even with drugs I mean it’s not like ok here. I think the other things is that it’s not an either or choice.  I think a lot of people parents sort of have this preconception that’s it either drugs or CBT and it’s not. It’s doesn’t need to be an either or. I mean I don’t know the statistics on how often it is combined but you know so I think that’s important to know as well as. This is a part of…\n",
      "Speaker: He ran away?\n",
      "Speaker: He ran away. Yeah\n",
      "Speaker:  Screw this\n",
      "Speaker: Oh man\n",
      "Speaker: Sorry\n",
      "Speaker: Alright, I’m heading out. Do you want me to get food on the way home?\n",
      "Speaker: Probably yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Okay. Bye\n",
      "Speaker: Bye\n",
      "Speaker: How long are you guys going to be.\n",
      "Interviewer: 5 to 10 minutes at most.\n",
      "Speaker: OK not along, bye\n",
      "Interviewer: So that’s actually a... well another question I had about this side of topics… if you had to describe CBT in three words, how would you describe it?\n",
      "Speaker: CBT in three words.\n",
      "Interviewer: Without saying CBT…. Or maybe three alternatively three words that come to mind in general when thinking about it.\n",
      "Speaker: Controlled exposure to reduce anxiety. That’s more than three. Controlled exposures or anxiety.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So very much about the exposure side in terms of dealing with anxiety. It’s kind of the big thing that comes to mind when you think about it.\n",
      "Speaker: It is yeah. I mean I know that’s a component of it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok um so I want to transition a little bit as I said at the beginning we’re making some videos. A lot of these questions are meant to guide the creation of the videos, but more explicitly I wanted to ask you know… these videos were meant to be for the general audience we potentially may have parental videos and then kid videos or it may just be that they’re both um, but from your perspective who do you think should be in these videos? Like what type of characters should be included?\n",
      "Speaker: What type of character?\n",
      "Interviewer: Right so you know and thinking about this should there be non-human characters and animals. Should there be…\n",
      "Speaker: No I don’t, no. I think it depends on your audience. For young children maybe you know. Animation or whatever, but for anybody 12 or older I would think that most compelling is going to be individuals who have gone through it talk about their experiences or whatever. That would be my thought\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok, so people who have gone through it. So like patients it sounds like. Patients who have experienced this.\n",
      "Speaker: mmhmm, yeah.\n",
      "Interview 024\n",
      "Interviewee: [NAME 0:01] obviously, yeah, I work for her and am part of her lab. I am a clinical technologist, so I am much more on the clinician side of things. I am involved in our research studies, but I'm definitely more knowledgeable about clinical practice, so you know I could speak to that and I could ultimately do my best to kind of represent the lab. Although I am definitely not the head of the different studies going on, although I do kind of know about them, so I'll be able to give you what I can.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, yeah perfect. And again, you know, you might be tempted to say that you're not the right person to answer some of these questions, but I mean I think that you're--what the study is really aiming to get at is perception, so I think that'll be perfect. Just to give you a framing of what we're gonna do today, our interview has two sections. The first section uses a technique that's called free listing, and the idea behind free listing is, it's a little bit like a fluency test. We will give you a prompt and then we'll ask for you to give us off the top of your head a list that comes to mind. So an example of a prompt might be, \"Could you please list for me all the animals that you can think of\" and then you would go ahead and say, \"Dog, cat, lion, tiger\" and keep going until you can't think of any more. And the difference between this and a fluency test is that it's not timed at all, and we are most interested in what items you list and what order they're listed in, and we want to get an exhaustive list from you, so feel free to take your time. And the idea again is just to generate a list, so fairly short responses if possible.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like there's a component of hoarding I guess we'll say behavior that is about the management of space? So, some people might enjoy a very clear and open space, whereas other people may feel really comfortable being surrounded by objects in a different way. Do you feel like is a part of hoarding behavior, or do you think that that is separate or not always seen, or sometimes?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think it depends on the person and you know I think it really takes a lot of time to understand somebody. Like why do they feel safe in a place that has a lot of stuff? Like what is it about the stuff and their space that is making them feel comfortable? And I think it's really important for anybody to understand that not everybody lives in the same way, like I wound't necessarily live in a home like my friend who has lots of stuff, but she may be more comfortable in that space than I am. So, I think when I look at it, I look at why they are living in that space and if there's safety lists involved that they're not considering, like I can see a lot from somebody I get a lot of consultations about. You know, this person is hoarding and then I go into their home and they just have a lot of stuff. There's no safety risks, but their family or their mental health worker just views it as being like not good or not a way that they would live. So, you know, in my experience I look at...when I'm looking specifically at space, less at their attachment, I look at the safety risks.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, you might go into somebody's house and feel like wow this is really a lot of stuff, but you don't make the call as to whether it's a disorder on the basis of your subjective impression of how much they have. You really only look at their space in terms of can they...is it interfering with their activities of daily living, can they get in and out of the house, does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, or if it's a fire risk and do they really feel safe in that space or comfortable in that space, or do they just feel uncomfortable with changing that space? So, I kind of have to make sure there's a differentiation between what's comfortable for them and if they're just not wanting to deal with the space. But really looking less at my own feelings towards their home, if that makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you frequently asses your clients' homes or space as part of an evaluation?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, especially because--\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you typically go to their home?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I go to their homes.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what were you going to say, especially because?\n",
      "Interviewee: Because that's kind of the only way that people get some service or...you know, that's the only way that I'm often involved in their space is because somebody else said that their space is unsafe for them to live in, so I look at the safety risks. If someone invites me into their home, generally it's because they want to make changes on their own and I do look at the safety risks but...yeah the safety risks is one of the biggest things I look at.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah [laughs]\n",
      "Interviewee: [INAUDIBLE 33:40] In a situation where you know, \"Okay then I'll take it and put it in the recycling,\" or \"Okay then I'll take it and donate it to this place,\" and then they'll say \"Oh no I'm not sure\" and then it kind of goes through...they might not have insight into their own feelings until they're actually questioned about it. So,\n",
      "Interviewer: So you have to kind of confront them with it before they are even aware that they would be distressed.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, or you know I think sometimes they know they may be distressed or have difficulty, but they don't want to admit it. I think what matters a lot for like the practitioner working with them is to have a really strong therapeutic relationship, where they feel comfortable talking about their feelings. Otherwise, helping them to reach a level of insight into their feelings is really difficult, and it's hard to learn new behaviors and to work on the actual attachment or the emotional part of the treatment if they don't have insight into their feelings.\n",
      "Interviewer: You use the word insight, and insight is a lot, in hoarding literature, kind of identified as a difficulty with this disorder, so I'd like to turn the conversation to insight, but first I want to ask how you would define insight in the context of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Whether people can recognize that they are having difficulties or anxieties or difficulties with discarding if they see the risks involved with their behavior. So, if they, you know...I don't always, it doesn't always matter to me if they say, \"I have hoarding disorder, I have a hoarding problem\" or \"I hoard items,\" because I think there's a lot of negative aspects to using that word with clients, they don't want to be labeled. And so I don't always think like insight means they have to--\n",
      "Interviewer: Identify as a hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Identify that they are hoarding or have a hoarding problem. So, it's more about whether they see the risks involved or whether they see what their behavior is doing to others and what it's doing to themselves, even if they can't recognize their feelings. But you know, do they understand that they're having difficulty sleeping because they have so much stuff in their bed that they sleep on the couch? And that it's the amount of stuff that they have is contributing to the fact that they can't do certain things or that they are having difficulty discarding that other people wouldn't have.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so another problem that you might've encountered is distinguishing hoarding disorder from often comorbid and related disorders, like depression or OCD.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think the cases of hoarding if I have the kind of clinical information that I was just telling you about, I don't feel like I've struggled very much in those domains. But sometimes I'm called by a community organization and they describe a dwelling to me and I haven't had the opportunity to talk to the person or conduct clinical assessments, I find those nearly impossible because I refuse to sort of say something just based on the volume of possessions alone, but I think the more difficult clinical decisions for me have been differential diagnostic decisions and I can think immediately of one case where there was the saving of rather bizarre items, and I was differentially trying to diagnose whether the hoarding was secondary to OCD or whether hoarding was primary and there were two primary co-occurring conditions. It was very tricky, I think the number of cases where we have hoarding in the context of OCD and kind of bizarre saving are limited. You know, they don't number many overall, so I find those very tricky to figure out what the driver is, what the obsessions and compulsions are. The other situation that I currently am working in and is of great interest to me from a research perspective, but having to do with diagnostics is hoarding in cases of severe substance abuse. So, in downtown east side of Vancouver, in the single room occupancy, SRO housing, there's a very very high drug-use rate, opioids largely and hoarding in SROs is overwhelming, this portion of the city and it's very tricky to figure out if the hoarding is secondary to the substance abuse, if it is a more primal sort of animal kind of instinct hoarding, you know the nesting kind of hoarding that Stephanie Preston has written about, or whether it's primary hoarding. And if it is primary hoarding, is it for, you know, for a means to an end of living because these people are in such obvious poverty. So, those conditions where it's not only a co-occurring other diagnostic problem like substance abuse, but the social elements of life I think really complicate diagnosis sometimes.\n",
      "Interviewer: So when you say social elements of life, you mean, for instance, poverty and worry about not having enough to eat later so therefore saving things now, that sort of thing.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, more particularly I'm thinking of it's very common for people from SROs to save things for their chop shops and so it's very hard in a room to know if what's being saved is actually, there's attachment to it and/or if it's a means to a way of life. And if the person is using substances, making that assessment is next to impossible actually.\n",
      "1:Speaker: Yeah. Kids like to be empowered. I feel like there’s almost two schools nowadays. The kids that have no power and the kids that have way too much power. There’s not many of the in between kids. I feel like anybody who feels like they’re in a place where they’re needing therapy like this is your thing to do for yourself kind of type thing and makes it user friendly. Again the parent it’s not a thing where you have to poke and nag because usually whatever is on their list is usually on yours including everything else. It really wasn’t a burden other than me getting her here and paying for everything. Again I think it’s just everybody really likes it, it’s convenient, you get fast results, it’s very empowering for your child or it was for us. It just seems effective and also another thing is that there’s no side effects. I almost feel like there could be a parody video or comedy that would just probably be for me but like about how you know there’s all these happy people and they’re like “yes, yes and you might die and your skin may fall off and everything’s burning but there’s still 27% of people that do…” Like everything is said with a smile on the face. Sounds so great but really what they’re telling you is terrible. Like this is not terrible. The risk that is involved in doing this method it’s like pretty low risk for pretty quick results.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: Well is there anything that I missed or anything important that I didn’t ask about?\n",
      "1:Speaker: I don’t think so. I just wish that this was more available like just to the public in general. Mental health has become such a big thing, especially with adolescence. Like I have to go to trainings all the time about all these things and I’m in the front lines with people’s kids that are going through all kinds of crazy stuff all the time and its intense and I feel like we get a lot of feedback about our school like “What are the resources?” and some don’t even know. It’s like there’s too many options or not knowing who to ask the right questions. So of course I’m always like “your pediatrician”. It’s almost like an alternative therapy but once you say “alternative therapy” some people immediately think it’s like a chant in the woods or something type thing or you’re going to sign up for this big weird thing so it would be great to have. I think it’s great what you guys are setting out to do and succeeded. People would watch a quick video that gave just enough information to be like “oh, maybe this is something we could do.”\n",
      "1:Interviewer: Well I think that is a great note to end it on. Unless did you have any questions?\n",
      "Note-taker: Nope I think we’re good.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: Well thank you so much for your time. You were very very helpful.\n",
      "Interviewer: Here we go. Okay, so thank you for meeting with us today. So, as I’m asking you questions, it’s going to be about cognitive behavioral therapy which is the therapy that we do here. But cognitive behavioral therapy is a little bit of a mouthful so I’ll refer to it as CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: And you can refer to it as CBT if you’d like. So to start, could you tell me what comes to mind when you think about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Basically just helping with whatever issues- I mean I think of… specifically what [NAME REDACTED]- you know just helping with the issues that she has.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. When you say issues, generally what are you speaking of? Could you elaborate a little bit?\n",
      "Speaker: [NAME REDACTED] has anxiety.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: She has always been a... high anxiety child so. She has anxiety issues.\n",
      "Interviewer: Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So could you tell me what you know about CBT in your own words? How would you explain what CBT is?\n",
      "Speaker: That is not an easy one for me.\n",
      "Interviewer: The best you can do.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, interesting. So, now I have a couple of questions that deal with the specific diagnostic criteria, and I know that that's not really how you look at this problem, but I still want to kind of think through these issues with you. So, the first one is about value and when we talked about what distinguishes a person who has hoarding disorder from somebody who's a collector, you mentioned that the person with hoarding disorder their space will be much more kind of impacted and unusable, and I'm wondering if in your mind the value of the items saved is relevant to whether or not somebody has hoarding disorder? So, could you be a person with hoarding disorder who exclusively saves one kind of item in the same way a collector might? You know, like you can imagine somebody's house is totally filled with like cuckoo clocks to the point that they can't use it, but that's all they save.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yup, you know and I think one of the interesting things is that they've taken the definition has changed around hoarding over the years. You know, the language around the definition used to say, \"Items that have little or no value,\" you know, but what we know is that people hoard all kinds of really nice stuff and really not nice stuff and I think a lot of it goes back to beauty is in the eye of the beholder. We certainly see people who hoard all of one thing, and sometimes it looks completely like trash to me and sometimes I can totally understand the value. I think when we think about value, I'm much more concerned about what's the value to the client that I'm working with, less about the finical value because we have people who hoard, you know the guy who has 15 or 20,0000 toothpaste caps, and for him they're extremely valuable, for me they would be trash. And so I think it's important that we as professionals are really careful about how we think about value.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, for you what's relevant really to telling if somebody has hoarding disorder is not what they're saving or how objectively valuable it is, more that their stuff is impairing their life. So, you could hoard valuable art and if your house was unusable, it would still be hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, for the most part.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, for the most part.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: So we’re almost done and I really appreciate your time. We just have to go over the “how” the video would look. Just kind of the fun part of this. And then just kind of the take home message, then we should be done. So we talked about Loony Tunes before, are there any other animated movies that you like?\n",
      "1:Speaker: I mean everybody loves like; the minion stuff is like hilarious. And I also think like part of the reason why is because they’re not people. Like what are they, who even knows? So fun. It’s pretty entertaining, anything that have comedy is good. I use a lot of “brainpop”. I don’t know if you know that, it’s the robot and the girl in the classroom and they just love anytime they hear the robot noises they want like the [makes noise] like he’s very squeaky and they want all the extra stuff.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: So they like, like the little squeakiness of the robot.\n",
      "1:Speaker: Yeah. Even my math curriculum has like animated stuff. And little monsters, they like the monsters too but they like the robots.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: I mean its good to know that that’s what they enjoy.\n",
      "1:Speaker: Boys and girls alike.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: Pretty universal robot. So my examples are going to be a little different from those. But I’ll let you look at those at your leisure. We have three options there, so as you’re looking through them I’m going to ask you a couples questions first about your overall preference. So which one you like the most and then if you think kids would like something different from what you like.\n",
      "1:Speaker: This looks like older kids to me.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: Option 3\n",
      "1:Speaker: This looks a little more mature like teens. This feels very vanilla to me.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: Options two seems kind of vanilla?\n",
      "1:Speaker: Like its friendly but this one is the one I like the best. It seems more creative and youthful but also that’s what I’m drawn to.  I also really like it because you blend humans and I like anything that looks hand rendered and I think kids identify with that too.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: So you like option 1 the best and you like the mixture of the animated and the hand drawn. You like that options personally the best but would that be the best for kids?\n",
      "1:Speaker:  I don’t know. These are softer and playful\n",
      "1:Interviewer: Option 2 is a little bit softer. Ok. What do you think should be the take home message of these videos? We’ve kind of hit on this so… Unless I’m mistaken.\n",
      "1:Speaker: I feel like there’s so many buzzwords but you know it really is just like doable because you get results. You can see results. Nearly immediately without much doing on my part other than bringing my child here and getting him the space to be; whatever happens in there. And then just kind of being aware and I did get some tips like you can’t be so nice. Don’t be so reassuring or affirming. Just not like trying to fix everything. But like it really is doable; it’s not a hard thing to do or take a lot of resources to do other than time and money. So I think it’s pretty quick. User friendly. Again I didn’t have to as a parent lead things or keep up with a whole lot like it’s something that really empowered my child to own it and take it into her own hands for the most part.\n",
      "1:Interviewer: That makes a lot of sense. You as a parent or you as a child that would be nice to get from the video.\n",
      "Interviewer: We're gonna talk a little bit more about that later. In fact, the next section of the interview we're gonna talk a little bit about the specific DSM-V criteria, and as I move into that section of the interview, I wonder if at the outside there are particular elements of the DSM-V criteria that you think might be particularly difficult to apply or that you've thought on clinical judgement they might be applied differently by different clinicians in different places. Does anything spring to mind about the criteria off the top of your head?\n",
      "Interviewee: I was working really closely with [NAME 29:26] when the criteria was developed for field trial actually. So, the first thing that comes to mind, which has been a longstanding conversation, is the distress or impairment in functioning criteria, so that \"or\" is an interesting one there. And of course reflects the egosyntonic vs egodystonic nature of hoarding and all of the controversy that kind of comes up around that, and I think in some ways we put that discussion to bed, but in other ways I think it's really still quite a central question. Not so much is a disorder a disorder if it is egosyntonic, but what does it mean when it is egosyntonic in terms of things like insight and motivation for treatment? So that's one piece, I think another piece that's really interesting to me, and has been since the time of sort of looking at that criteria, is acquisition as a specifier and I'm thinking more broadly about the relationship to compulsive buying sort of the works that [NAME 30:47] is doing and the models of compulsive buying and how we understand. Certainly buying is only one form of acquisition, but what the interrelationship is between those two things, especially given the impulse-control problem that is inherent in acquisition that is different in other elements of hoarding behavior. We don't see quite that same impulse-control problem, or at least manifesting in the same way. And then the third thing that I would say is this differential piece between, that the hoarding is better accounted for by other medical or mental health, you know physical or mental health problems and I think, you know, dementia is a whole place, brain injury is a whole place where actually doing the differential diagnosis to understand what the driver is is really complicated, and I don't think the structured energy for hoarding disorder as it currently stands or any of our other assessments, they weren't developed to help us make those differentials. So, I think we're really locked, I think, in those domains.\n",
      "Interviewer: So could you tell me if there is any specific skills or areas that CBT targets? It could be in your experience with your daughter.\n",
      "Speaker: You know, I don’t know because we don’t- you know, [NAME REDACTED] and I- we don’t talk about her sessions. So she keeps that as her time for whatever she wants to discuss. I know she has been much more open and communicative with me since she’s started therapy which... is a wonderful thing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. Good. So, as a parent, what is your involvement with CBT with your daughter-daughters?\n",
      "Speaker: Well, I bring them obviously.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes.\n",
      "Speaker: But, you know, if we have any… big events that could trigger anxiety or that I think their therapist needs to know about, I will let their therapist know about those issues. But other than- other than that, that’s their time to discuss what they need to discuss.\n",
      "Interviewer: For other parents, what would be useful for them to know when bringing their child in for CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: I think that… what I really liked was having that first initial meeting with the therapist to discuss overall, big picture what was going on. To kind of go over what the issues and kind of what the goals were. And check in periodically, especially when the life events happen.\n",
      "Interviewer: So have you ever heard or read about any scientific articles about CBT or any scientific research?\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: No. Do you think it’s something we should talk about in the videos about CBT? Do you think that would be beneficial to include scientific research?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I think that would be helpful. That would be good information to put out there.\n",
      "Interviewer: Did you know about somebody else’s experiences with CBT? Did you know anyone else who was in the therapy as well?\n",
      "Speaker: I have personally had therapy so…\n",
      "Interviewer: Oh okay.\n",
      "Speaker: I know that it’s helpful.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you would say that it’s positive?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay. So as we said, we are trying to develop short videos about CBT so this part of the process is about talking about the video itself. So the setting, the characters, what they would be doing. So first we have to decide who would be in the video. So what characters do you think we should include?\n",
      "Speaker: I guess that depends on your age range.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay.\n",
      "Speaker: That you’re targeting.\n",
      "Interviewer: So the videos would be for parents and children so we’re not sure if we’re going to be doing a separate video for parents or a separate video for children. So if it were one video for both children and parents, what do you think the characters should be?\n",
      "Speaker: Probably a parent and child if you’re looking for a parent and child video.\n",
      "Interviewer: Should there be any non-human characters like animals?\n",
      "Speaker: Probably, if you’re looking to target children.\n",
      "Interviewer: Or superheroes? Kids like superheroes these days.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah. Depending on your age- depending on the age you’re trying to target.\n",
      "Interviewer: So for the children should we include a boy or a girl or?\n",
      "Speaker: To target the boy group, you’re probably going to want a boy.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah. Or both that could be an option as well.\n",
      "Speaker: That’s true.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you said parents, should we include a doctor or friends?\n",
      "Speaker: …For the target group of- I mean is the goal of the video to… you know, just help parents understand why it’s helpful?\n",
      "Interviewer: So the goal of the video itself is to inform people about CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Whether that’s the parents or the child.\n",
      "Speaker: Okay… Then probably a doctor. That would be helpful.\n",
      "Interviewer: So now we know who would be in the video. We need to decide where they would be talking. So do you have any ideas of where they could be?\n",
      "Speaker: If you’re going to have a doctor, probably in a doctor’s office. You know, or if it’s a therapist then a therapists office.\n",
      "Interviewer: So should we have anything about at home or at school? Or even somewhere unrelated.\n",
      "Interviewer: And that's a difficult distinction, I mean, there are clinicians and researchers who think of hoarding disorder as a way of kind of making the space more conformable, so who kind of conceive of it as people who like to be surrounded by items, who feel safer and more at home when they are kind of closed in a little bit, and so I guess what that kind of gets at is at what point are we saying that people's homes, that they can't kind of manage their own space in a way that feels good to them? And making that distinction I guess can be difficult unless it's a very clear kind of safety and health hazard.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. I don't have a clear answer, I guess. It does come down to like a [INAUDIBLE 34:35] judgment on my part sometimes about whether it's getting in the way of their ability to function and their intended use. You're right, there can be gray zones.\n",
      "Interviewer: And, I guess, the next part of the interview, this leads into it quite nicely because the last part of the DSM-V that I'd like to discuss with you is about distress and then talking about insight. So, um, one really interesting thing that I've encountered in these interviews is the way that different clinicians think about this distress associated with discarding. So, some people kind of apply this criteria to mean they are distressed by their behavior, their behavior distresses them and they recognize that their life is impaired, and other people say \"No, actually that's not required at all, that's not what's meant by distress, what's meant is that they would hypothetically experience distress if they were discarding. So there is no actual distress in the disorder itself, when they keep their items they're fine, but if you try to make them throw it away, that's when they would experience distress and that's what the criteria is getting at. So, I'm wondering how you apply that distress criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: I usually interpret it as, I totally agree with the second group, that there are hoarders who don't have distress except when they're forces to discard, and if they've been successfully avoiding it for enough time, it's not a problem. But then the way that I apply the criteria is that they don't meet distress, but I will look for impairment instead. The way I am looking for distress to use the diagnostic criteria is distress at the problem, distress at the way they're living, or distress of the way it's bringing them into conflict with others or the impact on their finances from their excessive acquiring. But, distressed at some aspect of the problem, which absolutely correctly you're pointing out will only be there if there is some degree of insight.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, let's talk about insight, one thing that I ask clinicians is to tell me how they would define insight in the case of hoarding. What does insight mean?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think insight typically here means the recognition of the excessive feature of their accumulated belongings. And the recognition that it is getting in the way of their being able to live the kind of ritual filling life they would otherwise like to lead.\n",
      "Interviewer: So insight for you involves recognition that their behavior is impairing. So, distress is a key feature of insight for you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Distress is more related to insight, yeah.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Now that I think is a good one. A few times I was looking for something that should not have been put where it was. When you’re looking for something important, you look and look and look. Then you cause anxiety. Then you start getting angry. Then the people around start feeling your anger and it starts arguments. Like “why’d you put it there, it wasn’t there before.” You know. Yeah that’s the only time it ever got in my way. Because I was careless  and didn’t put something actually where it was supposed to go.\n",
      "31:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "And then that brings up, so not finding something brings up all the feelings of anxiety. Which just turns into a whole other mess.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "31:17 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. So I know I asked this earlier, and you said that your husband and brother aren’t really; they don’t really negatively say anything about it. But has it ever upset any of your loved ones?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "no it doesn’t. Not so much my husband because he still; my husband’s not a hoarder, he just a slob. I’ll tell you what he is, he’s just a slob.\n",
      "31:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "He’s just a slob?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. He’s not a hoarder.\n",
      "31:48 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "My brother is neat, but he’s just compassionate towards me. But I’ve seen his once is a while like you know, you can’t get through. I remember one time he invited my nephew and his wife and kids and there was nowhere for them to sit and he got kind of upset like god we have nowhere for anyone to sit in this house. And it made me feel bad because I have plastic chairs everywhere. So, I kind of, if I know he’s having someone over, I’ll just gather my stuff up and just dump it somewhere.\n",
      "32:27 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[unclear]. So yeah, other than that I try not to, I try to make sure that I do wish [unclear.]\n",
      "32:34 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. And has it ever impacted any relationships like romantically or familial? Or like with work?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh no, no. Nope I’m very good [unclear]. No\n",
      "32:49 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. And would you like to change your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know, I so would. I would love to be able to be that person. My son is like this. He could take a room and put things in its place and never lose one item. He’s one of those people if you haven’t used it in a year, you don’t need it. So that was the only thing. He tried to help me a few times and he goes “mom, you really need this.” So what I did was I just sat away and [unclear]. And I did get rid of some stuff, I was really proud.\n",
      "32:31 Interviewer:\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But you know. No I mean, I don’t know if I answered your question. I got off track.\n",
      "33:40 Interviewer:\n",
      "No you’re ok.\n",
      "Interviewer: Another area that I've thought about is this substantially compromises intended use. So, in the example of the patient that you gave, he has five bedrooms and 3 of which are closets, which is not their intended use, and I guess, who, how do you decide where it crosses the line for intended use? I mean, someone may store stuff in a bathtub and say, \"I don't take baths, I'll shower at the gym.\" Someone may store stuff on the stove and say, \"Well I don't ever cook and I don't know how to cook, so it makes sense for me to use my stove as a storage space.\" I guess what I'm saying is, is there a line with that intended use aspect of the criteria, or is it all kind of about functional status and safety?\n",
      "Interviewee: That's a really good one, Interviewer. I think it comes down mostly to the distress and functional status and safety. Because, like in the example of my patient, who says the bedroom is a sleeping place? I mean he has a very large home, it's about 4,000 square feet, so just because the builder defined it as bedrooms, doesn't to me mean that they're not useful for their intended use.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, yeah that's kind of what I was getting at is you know, if it's your space, if that's your home,\n",
      "Interviewee: It defines it accordingly, but and it--so your interesting one is what if it covers the stovetop but the person says, \"I never cook, I never have cooked, I never wish to cook.\" So, I think if somebody told me that, they've never cooked, they've never fried, they don't own frying pans, they don't have any desire to learn to fry an egg or to put up boiling water on a stovetop, so for them it is not a concern or a problem in any way, shape or form, then I would be hard pressed to find hoarding or clutter that's excessive simply based on that stovetop example. However, it's rarely in isolation. It's going to impact multiple areas of the home, and I would suspect there would be other areas where it's much more clearcut. But, I think you're right, it will be colored by their insight and justification. So, the hoarders I see, when I ask where they sleep who say they sleep on their comfy chair but they prefer it to their bed, they think they sleep better upright, so they don't want to sleep in their bed anyway, where you're right, I'm opposing my own judgment. I'm saying I think that's getting in the way of its intended use.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so now I'd like to talk through the DSM-V criteria pretty briefly. Are there any aspects of the DSM-V criteria that you find particularly difficult to apply or that you have thought that different clinicians may apply differently? Either things to do with the language or related to clinical judgement?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, for the most part I feel like criteria works pretty well, actually. I've questioned, in the early days I was strongly influenced by Gail Steketee and Randy Frost, thinking about acquiring as a core feature and wondered if it shouldn't be up there as a diagnostic feature, but over the years I've seen so many who don't endorse it as an active part, that if it were a requirement for diagnosis, it would have to be an option, right, it would have to be not absolutely required. So, I think that's actually fair, that's been a change in my thinking over the years. I sometimes think the language around the urge to save things is just a little bit, maybe just a little bit awkward potentially, because I think when I meet with individuals, you know it just says difficulty discarding regardless of the actual--the need to save due to distress associated with discarding. I think that's part of it, but for many of them it's also the strong urge to keep things. And sometimes I will meet people who say, \"It's not that I can't discard them, I just feel the need to keep everything cuz I might want it or need it.\" So, sometimes the way that the criteria is phrased sometimes seems like a slightly awkward fit to me for that reason.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, so one of the criteria discussed kind of difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of actual value, and I'm wondering if you ever think of the value of items as part of your kind of process. Do you have to have value, does the objective value of the item play into it? So, could someone, for instance, hypothetically hoard extremely valuable items? There was a, for instance as an example, a case of an art collector who's house was completely filled and absolutely unorganized and unmanageable, but all of the objects were, you know, priceless art artifacts or paintings and sculptures. So is the value of the items a part of your use of that diagnostic criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, not really. No, I wouldn't say that if they were living in a disorganized state, identified having more stuff than space to keep it, and it was compromising their pleasure and ability to live normally in their home, even if it's all objectively value, but I would still see it as hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, can you explain what you mean?\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean the person can say, \"Oh yes I have great difficulty discarding, yes I acquire a lot\" and on why they intend to save these things, \"Oh getting rid of them would be very upsetting to me\" but if there is no hoard, if there is no accumulation of possessions but if it's severe enough that we want to apply the word \"disorder\" to it, then we don't have a diagnosis. When you ask people about their impairment, if they don't have hoarding but they have too much stuff they will endorse impairment. It just dines't meet my threshold for impairment. Like if you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning off your dining table before you can sit down and eat, that doesn't count as hoarding to me.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well so that's kind of the cracks of the issue for me, is that I at least am very hard pressed to think of another disorder that requires external objects to be said to exist. You know like, it's been like a mystery for me in doing these interviews like how do you diagnose something that essentially you have to say exists in the person's mind, but you can only diagnose it if they have totally external items in sufficient quantities. You know like you would never diagnose like diabetes or hypertension or something based on how much ice cream or sugar that person has got their hands on, and if--\n",
      "Interviewee: No, but I don't thin that's the right way to think about it. I think that by looking at the person's home, it like gives you a measurement. So it's more like getting a person suspected of an eating disorder to stand on a scale. And if they're not underweight, it doesn't matter how much they say yes they're afraid of getting fat and they restrict their eating. If they're not underweight, they're not anorexic.\n",
      "Interviewer: I think that that's an interesting analogy. The other strange part about hoarding disorder that we'll talk about a little bit more, at least for me, is the criteria of distress because often people with hoarding disorder will not endorse distress. They'll say, \"I'm totally happy with the situation as it is\" and they might even deny that they would be distressed if they had to throw items away. But even then it would be hypothetical distress, but they might even deny that. Whereas as you mentioned, sometimes people who don't meet criteria for hoarding disorder will say they're distressed but the clinician has to say that's not true distress somehow. So you have again the situation where one person is saying, \"I'm not distressed\" and we're saying, \"Oh yes you are.\" You know what I mean? Like I wonder how you asses distress in the context of hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well isn't the criteria distress or impairment?\n",
      "17:33 Interviewer:\n",
      "And have you ever sought to change this behavior like\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So I was gonna say um just he decreases, my opportunity for hoarding.\n",
      "17:47 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so he decreases your opportunity.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "My opportunity. Yeah\n",
      "17:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "And have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, yes I do. I have a like a trick that I do, which is To get rid of five things. So, I try to on the weekends or on other days when there's like more time. I work sometimes. I will challenge myself to get rid of five things.\n",
      "18:31 Interviewer:\n",
      "That's awesome. Okay. And have you ever gone to a professional for help.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "18:38 Interviewer:\n",
      " Okay. Um, why have you never gone to a professional for help?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I guess, because I guess I don't feel that much of a problem. Doesn't impact me financially because my focus is on free and cheap things. And um, it doesn’t keep me up at night. It doesn’t cause me stress.\n",
      "Interviewer19:09- Ok sounds good. So, you’ve Mentioned that your partner keeps your behavior in check. But how do your other friends and family feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think that. Well, I, my friends, my family. I don't think they have any concerns because they’re worse. But I would say that…My friends, um, its just kind of embarrassing. [unclear] (19:48) But like, you know, somebody has a bag of clothes or something that they want to take to good will in the garage they’ve got like a pile of things that’s meant to go to charity or something like that. And so, sometimes people say “Oh here I’ve got a pile of clothes, see if there’s anything in here that you like.” So, I'm always very Eager to look through people things. And so I think that that when if that if that I’m over like a couple of times and I have that opportunity to do that every time I'm there and I feel that the person feels that maybe like kind of moochy or grabby about things and So, or that I'm only going over there to look for their free things. I don't think that that's the case. But I feel like they’re looking at me like, “oh, what does she want now?”\n",
      "21:01 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Like you just have you just have like a feeling like an intuition. But there's never been like any open conflict?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, no, no, no, but I feel like a person is thinking\n",
      "21:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "like you're being judged.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah.\n",
      "21:23 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, so like relating to that. Have you ever had conflicts with people close to you, or maybe landlords about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I mean I really haven’t. I mean to me I’m not that bad.\n",
      "12:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok so you’d say that you haven’t gone to a professional because you don’t think you’re that bad and because you think that in the future you’ll just have a room to yourself.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. I talk myself out of it.\n",
      "12:57 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. And I know you mentioned that your father and brother; or your husband and brother react negatively to your behavior.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, no I mean you can tell sometimes when they got to walk around something or when they invite people over. Yeah I can feel it I’m ashamed. I kind of hurts they don’t want to do it here. And right away I don’t care who you are, first thing ill say to you when you come into my house is “hey I’m an Ebay seller, I’m an Etsy seller, this is my stuff. I have no office.” That’s my [unclear].\n",
      "13:36 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. So would you say you’ve had any conflicts with people about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No because I get you before you get me.\n",
      "13:46 Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha. So you immediately give them the excuse that you work for Ebay?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes. And I do actually do.\n",
      "13:56 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And something people look at me like I didn’t even care. You know? But I want to get to you first.\n",

      "Ok. So now we’re moving on to the area where we’re going to explore your space and living area now. So you mentioned that you live with your husband and brother. Do you live with anybody else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "14:17 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. And could you des-. So you said that most of your stuff is cluttered around where you are the most.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Where I am yeah.\n",
      "14:27 Interviewer:\n",
      "right. So, basically if could describe the place you would say that it’s hard to walk around sometimes?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well let’s just put it for you this way. The only way to get to my space is one way. There’s this one little walk- [unclear] and one time he had a chair, a regular chair that I could sit in [unclear] the other side of me has this bookshelf with big things in it and its filled. I even added a whole new table beside it because I ran out of room on the table.  But there’s no room. My husband has his chair which is next to me, he could only go one way out. To go around the coffee table. So, I don’t know if I answered your question but there’s only one way in and out. Where I sit.\n",
      "15:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "No you answered it.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It has all my stuff around it.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, there was this paper published by Randy Frost where he talks about the concept of insight, and he in the paper broke it down into different constructs, and I'd like to read you these constructs and have you think with me through which in your mind are the most important or how you see them related to each other. So the constructs that randy came up with are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness, overvalued ideation, so that would be more of a persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items, or indifference. Um, and I'm wondering how you see these fitting together in people's insight. So, these are interesting to me because they are so varied. So, overvalued ideation or anosognosia even, sound almost more like a delusional disorder where you're looking at an item and you have an unreasonable belief that the item is more valuable than it is, or you're looking at your space and you think that your space looks normal, even though is objectively, you know no one with objectivity would see it as normal. Whereas defensiveness is much more based on behavior and indifference also is very behavioral and seems sort of like related to depression and just not caring about space. So, I guess what I'm getting at with this question is how do you think about these and do you see them all as equally relevant or do you feel like some are more central to insight as you understand it in hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: So, I have to confess I have not given this any thought before and I haven't seen that paper, so this is the first I'm hearing about this model for insight or the different aspects of insight, but I think it's really interesting and kind of a-- what was the first one again?\n",
      "Interviewer: Defensiveness\n",
      "Interviewee: I guess I'm just not quite sure about defensiveness fitting with the others.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, how so?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I kind of, so the others are like core features of their... would define why they don't have insight. Whereas defensiveness is more of a reaction to some insight, and not wishing to acknowledge a problem. So in a way defensiveness almost implies some degree on insight.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, in order to be defensive you have to know that there's something to defend.\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly, so don't know that I would agree with defensiveness being one of the constructs. But the other three sound really good and right on to me, actually, and very much map onto my experience.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, do you see a degree of, I mean I don't want to overstate it, but something along the lines of a delusion with hoarding patients? Do you think that when they look at items they are literally delusional at times in terms of their beliefs?\n",
      "Interviewee: I've seen, I have not, I know that it's described, I have not really seen people. I'm trying to think if I have seen people who I thought were clearly at the delusional rather than poor or almost absent insight. I don't think I've actually seen anybody where I've termed it delusional.\n",
      "Interviewer: And I guess my question is, do you view hoarding as a disorder that is progressive in a sense of getting worse with age, like the behavior intensifies as a person ages? Or do you think that the reason older people tend to have it is more related to them needing time to have accumulated that much stuff? You know, them being maybe in a social place in their lives where older people are going to be more isolated, their children have left, you know maybe left their stuff at home, they're more likely to be in a stable living space for a longer period of time rather than moving to new apartments every couple of years. Or even it's just getting picked up at that stage because they are less mobile. I guess what I'm asking is do you think it's progressive? Do you think it worsens with age, maybe do to cognitive issues or do you think that it's mostly a side effect? That it happens to be seen mostly with older people for more kind of lifestyle or social reasons?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it's both. I think that all of the reasons that you listed about why it might be more evident in older people, all of those ring true and I would say maybe up until early older adulthood that would be the primary driver. Maybe add to that list deceased parents, so now you have the extra stuff that you don't know what to do with, and then I think that there probably is a progressive, even if there's not like cognitive decline, there's physical decline. And so, you get a new printer, what do you do with the old one? Well it's harder to do stuff like that when you're 75 than if you're 35.\n",
      "Interviewer: Just cognitively harder?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think cognitively and physically. Like the whole package of aging is harder to--\n",
      "Interviewer: Harder to get anything done.\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly, exactly. So you have the house painted and then there's all these cans of empty paint, what do you do with them? I would say, like maybe--okay, so here's a hypothesis. Maybe in older adults, if this were true you would expect to see that the more recently acquired items in the home were actually passively saved rather than intentionally saved.\n",
      "Interviewer: That's interesting, I would like to know the answer to that. That's a good way of figuring that out. Like maybe they've been more intentional and then at a certain point they've just stopped discarding because it's harder and that would be a way you could figure that out.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, exactly. Yeah because people do stop acquiring in some point in life, like you get everything you need so you're not acquiring these things intentionally like just to add to, like \"oh geez I could use a [INAUDIBLE 1:02:36] or whatever\" [laughs].\n",
      "Interviewer: So you think that maybe the intentional acquiring like shopping acquiring stops at a certain point or slows down and then it becomes more passive.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah I think it probably slows, yeah. You'll still need a new printer every once in a while, but you wouldn't necessarily upgrade.\n",
      "50:53 Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you so much. Have a good rest of your day.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Thank you. Thank you.\n",
      "50:57 Interviewer:\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay. Bye bye.\n",
      "End of transcription.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I think I would be upset. Yes, I would be upset, but I don't know for how long. Sometimes I think about things that I got rid of and I mourn for them like “oh I wish I had; god why did we get rid of that?” Especially something that wouldn’t have taken up any space. “Like oh I remember I gave that away!” Um, but that it was finally able to be given away. I don't remember feeling bad about the time later, I think, oh, “if only, if only.”\n",
      "44:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "It’s like the reflection about it that makes you upset.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, when I do my five things I don't, like, the next day go through and see what I got rid of, for example, I got two bags in my bedroom now on the floor and it's a collection of many days of five things, but I know I went and said “you know, what’s in here?” then half the stuff I pull out again. You know, so there’s that as well.\n",
      "44:38 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And the very last question is would you like to change your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, I would like to change my behavior. Sometimes and maybe actually I can change my behavior on the acquiring side. It’s the acquisition. I’ve trained myself on the acquiring side to not stop and look at the bulging trash can. To not stop at that garage sale. To look away when somebody’s pulling out their stuff. But once it’s in that’s when it stays. That’s the hard behavior. The holding.\n",
      "45:27 Interviewer:\n",
      "And what do you think would be like the biggest benefit to you, changing your behavior like what do you think the most positive impact would be?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think like when I go to someone else's house. Has two things are for a vacation somewhere hotel or something and there’s very few personal things in the minimalist sort of space and it feels so open you know it just feels so open. And wiping down is so easy it’s not like you got to move stuff. You just wipe it down. And that's what would be that would be a psychological lift of lightness and then also a production in time. In work time.\n",
      "46:24 Interviewer:\n",
      "So just like the mental relief added with just like the ease of doing things that should be quick and easy.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "46:36 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Thank you so much.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, thank you for the conversation.\n",
      "46:42 Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no problem it was fantastic, actually, um. So right now, I'm just going to ask you a couple of demographic questions. What is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female\n",
      "46:56 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And then your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "46:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "And okay your race.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s interesting. Yes. So I would say that they, oh wow I’m just think like could I just walk away from these things? No, I don’t think I could do that. But when I am, but I don't feel like when I come back from Being at someone else's house or being having gone on vacation. I don't feel like, oh, my thing. Oh, I'm finally home with this feels right. So, so that's interesting. I think that I… kind of important.\n",
      "25:34 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not as important.\n",
      "25:40 Interviewer:\n",
      "So they're not they're not like a necessity, like they don't. You don't need them all the time in order to feel comfortable.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I definitely don't need all the time.\n",
      "25:47 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But, I know what you mean but no I don’t.\n",
      "25:49 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and which objects are most important to you and which ones do you spend a lot of time with?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I think maybe. I Like styling these books. I’ve got these books. I’ve got books on top of books, and books in front of books. Plus around the other books. And books over there. Maybe, maybe it's the books. Uh, yeah but I also have these baskets. And I’ve got baskets for the whole neighborhood, but nobody who's going to get any of them.\n",
      "26:46 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you would say that books and baskets are the items that are most important to you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "26:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And are there specific parts of your home that you would consider cluttered.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’d say that every part of my home has a corner that’s cluttered. So, there isn’t like this one room, or “I'll keep everything in that room so this room can be uncluttered.” So, like there’s pockets in every, every room.\n",
      "27:28 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And you would say that they are cluttered, just because there's objects that shouldn't be there or that are like in little stockpiles?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "There are things, like things on the floor. That should be not on the floor.\n",
      "27:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. That should have their proper place and be put away.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That should have a proper place. The proper place is not on the floor. But there isn’t a proper place. It’s not that I’m not tidy, it’s because there’s not a place.\n",
      "28:00 Interviewer:\n",
      " Okay. Um, are there parts of your home that you don't use so like parts of your home that aren't being used in the way that they were intended to be used?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I'm not sure what you mean by that. For example, we’ve got two bedrooms for my children who aren't here now. And I’ve resisted putting my things in there. But I could also imagine that I could take over this house because we’re an empty nest now. They're not being used for me but they’re being held for them.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you're telling between them, it seems like what you're saying is it goes back to the root cause of the behavior. That OCD can cause accumulation of items similar to hoarding disorder, but still be driven by OCD motivations.\n",
      "Interviewee: Absolutely, so people with, I have numerous in my practice, with contamination concerns who can't touch things they're brought in the house because of cleanliness versus dirtiness and they need to do washing rituals and end up avoiding handling things and end up avoiding discarding for that reason. I have individuals with fears of something incriminating being on any paper material, and so they have to check it, or being worried about throwing out something valuable getting mixed in with the items they want to discard, so the checking rituals become prohibitory difficult. You know, somebody with obsessions around personal information and identity theft, who looks to all intensive purposes superficially like a hoarder because he accumulates everything that comes in the door, but it's really about his concern around identity theft and his having to check it meticulously to make sure he didn't somehow get a piece of mail mixed up with it or something that has his phone number or credit card number or any other information on it. So, I've seen a broad variety of cases like that, but I think usually when you explore the motivation for the difficulty around the discarding, I feel clinically myself that it's not all that difficult to tease apart.\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you ever encountered a case of sub-clinical hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: Many.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what does that look like?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, people who will comment to me that they feel they have a bit of excessive accumulation, they may themselves note that they have a bit of difficulty discarding, it's hard for them to do it, they feel a sense of reluctance to part with things, but they'll tell me, you know, eventually they get to it or they've build up a safety network with a family member checking in with them ever 3 months, if they themselves have difficulty, to kind of help them work through it so that they say when we discuss the condition of their home, that their accumulation of material does not in any way impact on their ability to live the way they want to live in their home or use the space suitably, not in a significant way.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, it's subclinical in that case, even though they have the impulse, they're able to kind of keep it in check and manage their space.\n",
      "Interviewee: With difficulty often, yeah that would be the kind of, profile in my mind of a subclinical hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer: That's a really interesting answer to that question, I think that's the first time I've ever heard that answer in exactly that way. How do you judge that, I guess, in the context of different people kind of just having different amounts of space? So, somebody might live in a ver small apartment and have less space, and therefore just need fewer items to reach that threshold?\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly, that's right. It's part of our research, we make our diagnosis informed in part by photographs that the participants bring in of their home. So we have healthy control participants, we have sub-clinical hoarding and hoarding, so I see inside a lot of homes that way [laughs]. And so I've seen quite a lot of small apartments, and people who are not hoarding, they just have fewer things in the smaller apartment. Kind of like a person living in a big home and lots of storage space has a lot of stuff in that storage space, and a person who lives in an apartment without much storage space at all would make different choices and have fewer items.\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess you could take that example kind of to the extreme though, and you could say imagine a person who has an enormous house and maybe an ability to buy multiple storage units and is just never going to run out of space, just financially is never going to reach that threshold, will that person ever have hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, that's the thing. I think that even a person who has a large amount of space, if you're not responsive to the amount of space you've got....so, let's say they have what you might call an insatiable desire to acquire, even a large home can be filled up.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, so a person with hoarding disorder is always going to fill all of the space, even if they have a lot of space.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think they will. Especially--the other thing I think that happens is that, I don't know this for sure but I think that the creep of possession occurs so gradually, that the person doesn't notice that their living space is getting smaller and smaller.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so it's not a sudden influx of items, it's a slow acquisition.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. Every once in a while I'll hear about somebody who inherited stuff, you know. We had to clean out mom's house and I didn't know what to do with it so everything's here. Every once in a while I hear something like that, but often I think that it's that they're just not noticing until there's some kind of tipping point. That the space to maneuver has gotten littler and littler and the amount of space they have to sit on the sofa has gotten smaller and smaller.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you see very many people who fall in that category of sub-clinical?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, we would see more but we try to screen them out and we use photographs in our telephone screening. I think what gets in the way is the questions that you would ask to evaluate whether someone has difficulties discarding things that other people might part with. That kind of question for a person who doesn't know anything about hoarding, they may say yes if they have just a strong attachment to things or if they've always been the kind of person who's a bit messy or if maybe they have a family member who's a minimalist, so they have some kind of conflict about it. But they're not actually anywhere close to hoarding, they'll say yes to all of those mental state questions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Because they don't really have a context for what an abnormal response would look like.\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly, exactly. And then when we look at the photos of their home we go, \"Oh, right.\" You know like had one woman who said, \"Oh gosh, my bedroom is barely functional, you know sometimes I walk across the room and I trip on my shoes.\" And we looked at her bedroom and actually yeah there was a pair of shoes on the floor, but that doesn't mean hoarding. It's just a bit of a messy person.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhm, I can totally understand that too, having...you know, it's interesting to do these interviews because when you don't--when I started out doing them I didn't know anything really about hoarding disorder and reading the diagnostic criteria I was like, \"Well this is so vague,\" but when you talk to experts they're like, \"it's honestly really not difficult to tell.\" You know like it's not vague at all, but it's interesting too because it does seem to be a little bit of a gestalt, almost like a you just know it when you see it kind of a thing, rather than there being a clear yes or no boundary.\n",
      "Interviewee: It is hard to describe, I would say it's like the concept of a [INAUDIBLE 31:58] set, there are hoarded homes that are clearly hoarded, they pretty much all look alike. But there are a lot of cases that kind of fall in the middle that are difficult, and it might be because there's somebody else in the home who is keeping a lid on things.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "after three years of law school and then you go to Santa Fe. That kind of hurt my chances.\n",
      "37:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right. Ok. And then finally, would you prefer an electronic or like an amazon gift card sent to you electronically or would you prefer a physical gift card sent in the mail.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No you do it email or whatever.\n",

      "Participant:\n",
      "Can I ask you a question?\n",
      "37:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah go ahead.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Ok I just need to ask you who would I go to and could you take the information. Who do I ask about my daughter? She’s a [unclear] hoarder. She would love to have that [unclear].  So how could she get involved in this? She said she’d do it in a minute. She said now her place is awesome. You know what its from? Smoking pot. She’s got a medical card. So I don’t know if you guys want to study something like that, what does marijuana do?\n",
      "38:02 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um, I can give you an email that you could contact.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "ok.\n",

      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: I think it's because animal hoarding is even worse than object hoarding in terms of people ever seeking treatment or staying in treatment.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, so I just haven't had them, so it's a really really interesting question. Um, but that one case who comes clearly to my mind was somebody where I realized after time that only when frankly, anyway there's a number of complications in his case that make it even more interesting and complicated, but I ended up coming to the decision that he had, I called him a delusional disorder and it was with regard to the animals because he describes himself as safe keeping them and taking care of these animals that would otherwise be destroyed eventually, and when I next had contact was after there had been a home inspection and housing authorities and SPCA etcetera had gotten involved, and they reported animals in his home that had died and in deplorable conditions. And even so, when I met him he maintained in a way that I found seemed totally believable and frankly delusional that he was taking good care of them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, that seems to be a pretty common experience with animal hoarders and I've gotten really curious about the relationship between the two disorders because behaviorally, and kind of conceptually, it makes sense that they would be related and both related to OCD, but there seems to be something about animal hoarding that crosses lines that object hoarding just doesn't seem to cross. And, this wasn't, I don't think this was actually on your list but sometimes clinicians will talk about their patients with hoarding disorder who kind of over-identify with objects or over-empathize with objects of have some emotional connections with objects\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh yeah, absolutely I've seen that one, I missed it. An individual of mine who sees objects as having feelings and the ways she treats it is core to the difficulty discarding, because if you treat anything with disrespect and make it feel like its unwanted would be hurting it, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: And I'm wondering almost if animal hoarding is maybe an extension of that aspect of object hoarding, where animals are, they kind of over-empathize with them are they are so concerned about harm to them that they, I don't know I'm still working on it, that might be a future direction but I wanted to get your ideas. I have a couple of closing questions, so I don't want to keep you longer than you have though, so if you need to go just let me know.\n",
      "Interviewee: I have 5 minutes, okay, but then I do have to wrap up.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, absolutely. So, this is a hard one, but we talked about the reasons that people give for their hoarding behavior, and I'm wondering if you think that these are the real reasons that they're saving, the reasons that they give, or are these reasons post-hoc justifications for an underlying biological need, which they will do and then they'll kind of retrospectively justify them cognitively?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don't know how you would test that model.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I guess it's just a speculative question it's not a testable one.\n",
      "Interviewee: I'm trying to see offhand a way that you would do a study which would enable you to discriminate that. If I say then give that as the reason, and they seem to believe that, even if it's post hoc, how are we going to distinguish that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um yeah i think i think about the path from the door to the chair and from the chair to the TV and from the TV to the bathroom because that’s how my grandma lives. And so, I think worst-case scenario.\n",
      "39:50 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And so, finally we're entering our last section which is on distress or interference, um, does your hoarding disorder upset you like do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not daily. But I think that it’s something that I focus or I think about weekly. You know? Like my five, get rid of five things and right now we’re talking and looking at these two big boxes on this one. Books in front of books. I recently lost a lot of weight and didn’t really notice that I had all this weight and it was. And now that I don't have this weight and my clothes are really loose like gosh how I didn't even realize. That all myself. Fill this thing up.  And so, now that it's gone. I see how much space right and so I feel like these books are there, they just kind of there like my hips and if I don't think about them they’re just going to stay there. So if I start moving them\n",
      "41:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "You’ll realize\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah there’ll be more space. I can ignore it really easily and look away from it. But if I do look at it, it causes me a problem or is a problem.\n",
      "41:38 Interviewer:\n",
      "And, Could you describe a time when you're hoarding disorder in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "How ‘bout it this? I was, we were going to go visit family and I wanted to take some pictures of our house so I could show, you know, show off where we live to our family who hadn’t seen it. So, I was walking around with the iPad looking at the pictures, looking at the scene I was going to take and thinking “Oh, I don't want, I don't want them to see that.” So, you know, rather than just going into each room and snapping a picture which were taken five minutes it was hours. You know, moving the things here. So, I could have seen the great and then turning it in the other direction then I move it so that that scene looked good. Then in the kitchen, moving all of this over here. Moving it all in the other direction. So, its something that should have taken only; it shouldn’t have needed any thought. It took ages and ages because I would be embarrassed for them to see the pictures of it as we lived.\n",
      "43:11 Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand. Okay. Thank you so much. Um, and our last question is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Interview 021\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, perfect. Okay so now we're going to get into the more conversational part of our interview, and for this I'd like you to just begin by giving me a little bit of background about you in terms of how you encounter individuals with this disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, well I do research and I have two lines of research having to do with hoarding, one with community-based interventions for hoarding and there I don't actually talk to people who have hoarding themselves, I'm talking with some of the service providers, like a fire department guy or a street nurse or something like that, and they talk about patients. And we also collect data, so there's data about the cases, but it's quite impoverished because there's no person attached to it. The other line of my research has to do with psychological functioning in hoarding, and there we actually have people who identify as having problems with hoarding come into our research lab and we give them a diagnostic interview and a bunch of testing. I directly listen to the diagnostic interviews, so I hear--I don't conduct them but I supervise them, so I hear quite a lot of stories from these recordings. And finally I supervise a [INAUDIBLE 17:13] doing group [INAUDIBLE 17:16] for hoarding. And so we usually have less than 6 clients per year and two students, probably like 2 more that don't work out for the group, and I watch all of those sessions, but I also attend home visits. I get to know the clients personally, that way [INAUDIBLE 17:44]. I also have treated hoarding individually, but I just don't have time to do that all of the time.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what degrees do you hold?\n",
      "Interviewee: I have a PhD in Psychology, clinical.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, now we're gonna talk through the process of diagnosing hoarding disorder and we're gonna specifically talk about some of the DSM-IV criteria. So, just to kind of begin, what for you are the main and most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps collecting or even extreme collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: For me the major difference is that in normal saving, or even collecting, the person's decisions about what to acquire or save are responsive to the amount of space they have available.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting.\n",
      "Interviewee: So some people have a lot of space and some people don't have that much space, but people make choices in relation to that space and I think people who hoard are not making those choices.\n",
      "15:29 Interviewer:\n",
      "Other than the living room, are there any other rooms that are cluttered?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Ok. I had extended; I’m looking right at [unclear]. I’m looking right across from me at my dining room. It’s not a dining room because I haven’t sat in there and all my personal stuff is on those shelves. My son just even my bookshelves on wheels so I can stack them in front of each other and if I need something I can just move them aside on the wheels. I just slide them. So yeah it extends into the dining room. Other than that, there’s no other room.\n",
      "16:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.  And how important; like which objects are most important to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "which what?\n",
      "16:22 Interviewer:\n",
      "which objects are most important to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The most important would be things people give me. And that; I wish I knew the word I’m trying to say what that is. But that’s the things that people give me. Its sentimental.\n",
      "16:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "Sentimental. Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah that’s my number one thing. My daughter says, “Mom take a picture of it.” Uh, uh. I have balloons from twenty years ago. You know right away I felt [unclear]. Sentimental stuff. And then I have stuff that, my next thing would be of course my work stuff, because I gotta have it around me. Then the other stuff is the ones where the pain in the butt is I can’t throw nothing away. I don’t care if its string. It’ll work for something. I don’t care if it’s a broken knob on a drawer. Hay, I might craft with that one day because I do like to craft. So that’s the three things.\n",
      "17:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. So you’d say that your most valuable items would be the sentimental items that people have given you, the things that you need for work, and your craft; things that you could potentially use for crafts.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well not crafts, its anything that right away I’ll say, “oh I can use that.”  Anything that I feel can be used before I die.\n",
      "17:48 Interviewer:\n",
      "ok. Gotcha. Are there any parts of your home that you don’t use, like rooms that weren’t, aren’t being used the way they were intended? Like are there things in the bathtub or on the stove or anything?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Nope. Nope. That’s what I’m saying, its right here.\n",
      "18:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know that’s what I’m saying. I know I’m not a bonafide, certified hoarder but I can sure, you know, stand among the people.\n",
      "18:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha. Um ok. So now we are going to go to the section that talks about value. So you mentioned that sentimental items are really valuable to you. And why do you think that is?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes. Yeah, so, um, I've got a really good system with my clothes and so that is there's a certain amount of space that is in the closet and that's how much space in the closet, there's an extra closet or not an extra place for any clothes. And so when, When that's and that's the right amount. And so, if I want to get something new and something got to come out. I don't have a problem with that. Now I'm taking it more space in the closet and my husband is, I recognize that. He hasn't asked to reclaim and of the space. So, the space that I have is my space and that is the right amount of space is what fits in there is the right amount of thing. Okay. But, I don't have that rule with the books. And so, the books; I can't see the books behind the books because there's books in the way. So, I see that that's too many books, but if I did get rid of five on the books out be really hard. Okay, I don't think I could do that.\n",
      "33:28 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so for some things you have a set system, like for example your clothes. But for things that are more valuable to you, It's a little bit more difficult to realize when you have too much.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, yeah. Well I realize that I’ve got too much but I don't have a solution for reducing and there’s no space for another bookshelf. [unclear]\n",
      "33:56 Interviewer:\n",
      "So the last question in this section about value is. If you had to choose between your items. How do you think you would choose?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Like if I had to choose.. Like if there was a fire?\n",
      "34:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "Pretty much. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "How would I choose? I suppose I would choose to take what I could carry. Nothing that if I had to choose, I would choose on value. So probably grab take my jewelry, because even though I don't feel as emotional about that; attached to that, I feel it has more value. You know the money value. So that’s what I would choose based on money value. So I wouldn’t take my can openers.\n",
      "35:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "Moving on to our next section, which is about distinguishing Hoarding Disorder. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "What’s the difference? Hmm what is the difference between normal saving… So, lets see, so my sister has an eBay business and she has all the things everywhere all over the place because he's one day sort this out and do eBay on those things. And she recognizes that it feels like grandma's hoarding but she has plans for all of those things which is to sell all of those things. So that is more like saving. Whereas my things I don't have any plan for. I mean I don’t even, I mean I’ve read these books and I haven't read some I know I'm never going to get to. They're like, they're all together. I'll do feeling books. They’re all good. I’ve got a good, nice collection of those. So, hoarding is when there's no plan. My grandma with her penny savers, she had a plan for those. So, she didn’t consider that to be hoarding. That was more of, she was saving those.  Whereas me with no plan, I’m just hoarding. My mom as well. With her little [unclear] for the door to the back. I know she had no plans for any of those things.\n",
      "37:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's just all about the plan is how you distinguish saving from hoarding.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "think so. Yeah.\n",
      "37:18 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um, and is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I, I, in my mind, I think that maybe somebody who’s grabby and has a difficult time sharing, I'd say I would guess that person's house was filled with junk.\n",
      "Interviewer 37:52 – Okay, and where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "um, where do I get the information? I think a few of those TV shows that; It's fascinating to see other people’s hoarding. And my sister. She's got a website, ugh well she doesn’t have a website but she’s got a blog or something, you know, about; she has a difficult time cleaning. And so, there are a lot of hoarders that have a difficult time with cleaning apparently because she shares some stories with me that she’s come across this blog, it helps people who have difficulty with cleaning. So yeah. Basically, that's where I get my information, I wouldn't say that I look at journals in the same way that I do about other things,\n",
      "38:58 Interviewer:\n",
      "um, and how do you feel about the hoarding TV show.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, it’s fascinating like watching a car wreck. Fascinating and sad.\n",
      "39:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Like also, what is that called? There's a word for that. Could happen to you. It's more like morbid fascination because I could get that that but I'm not. At least I’m not like that.\n",
      "39:26 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right. And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, well, I usually answer that with Schumann, is that all right, or do we like to do more,\n",
      "47:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "um, could you please be more specific?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay um white.\n",
      "47:13 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And do you identify as Hispanic or Latino.\n",
      "Participant:\n",

      "Participant:\n",
      "um, 50,000.\n",
      "47:26 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then you mentioned that you live in [state]. So I'm, I'm going to assume that you live on the [geographic region].\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "47:37 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have a postgraduate certificate of education.\n",
      "47:46 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and then for the $30 gift card. Would you prefer to receive it to receive like a physical gift card in the mail, or are you okay with an electronic gift card?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I already have, oh electronic would be great but I already have this gift card from the other study. I don't know if you're connected with them to add it on to that\n",
      "48:12 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yup you can get another one.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Another card; physical card. I don’t even know how to use this card. So I'd rather have an electronic one.\n",
      "48:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and then\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have this bank of America prepaid card from the University of Florida.\n",

      "okay. I'm just to let you know there may be a delay on the gift card. I'm just because of COVID so it may take a couple of weeks, but you will be getting it.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "50:06 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um and I think that that's all I have for you. Um, thank you so much for your participation. We truly appreciate your help and there's\n",

      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay, very good.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, no, no, no. That’s okay. I don’t like to be told to choose. You know, because It’s like I’m afraid you’re going to say, “would you choose your family or your stuff.”\n",
      "21:50 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s what I was afraid you’re gonna say.\n",
      "21:52 Interviewer:\n",

      "22:12 Interviewer:\n",
      "No its ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s it. I can’t tell you.\n",
      "22:19 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s all important to me.\n",
      "22:21 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "If I get rid of this, that’s my business. If I get rid of that, that’s my sentimental stuff. So, nothing’s going you know.\n",
      "22:30 Interviewer:\n",
      "ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I just need to get [unclear] that’s the thing that [unclear] me.\n",
      "Interviewer 22:36: right. Ok. So now we are going to move on to the section about distinguishing hoarding disorder. So, what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You’re asking me?\n",
      "22:58 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, like what’s the difference between someone just wanting to save something and someone who has hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I can answer that one because before I got really, really bad I used to love black and white cows. But when I would collect them I had a certain place for them. They we like in glass things. I mean I had every cow thing there was. I kept them in a certain place. They weren’t all over. And then there’d come a time where I had to leave because we had a mold situation in one of our houses. It didn’t bother me. Ok? Hoarding, I mean I got upset the minute you asked me what was more important.\n",
      "23:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yup. That upset me. Everything’s important.\n",
      "23:49 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. So, you’d say…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s the difference my reaction.\n",
      "23:53 Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead. So you’d say the main difference between normal behavior and hoarding disorder is that saving behavior there is not as much of an emotional attachment but whereas with hoarding disorder there is.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes. You know yeah. Its mental. That’s where your mental thing comes in.\n",
      "24:13 Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Interviewer: So, could a person have insight and say, \"Yeah I have hoarding disorder and this behavior is abnormal and its impairing my life, but it's my life and I want to keep my items\" is that a patient with insight, or where would insight kind of fit into that for that patient? They recognize their disorder is real, but they don't want to change it. They don't feel distressed by it, could you have insight without distress?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I'd say if you recognize that they still have a problem in the way they relate to stuff, they're still insightful about one aspect of the problem, they may say it's poor insight, depending on how they described it and depending on what I was objectively hearing about their life.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you see patients, how much insight do they typically have when they come to you?\n",
      "Interviewee: So the population I see typically ranges between fair to good insight, because I am a psychiatrist to which people are referred for treatment. I'm not out there in the community, I'm at a hospital setting, a tertiary care hospital setting. I mean I get the occasional one where they're coming just because their family members have pushed them, but they're a small minority of the people I see myself.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so when you're seeing people who have reasonably good insight, do you have any idea how they gained insight on their own or what that process looked like for them?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don't know that I do have a good feel for that, it typically comes on gradually but no I would say I don't have any specific understanding of what triggered them to begin to recognize that it was a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewee: Because for people who hoard, I see that as being similar to anorexia, bulimia, alcohol use disorder. There are a few disorders like that where the person might not be distressed, but an outside person can see there's obvious impairment here. It might be true even for attention problems, like attention deficit problems, so for the person who actually has hoarding disorder and they're saying, \"I'm not distressed\", that to me, because the criteria really is distress or impairment, and you can see these other disorders where they're egosyntonic, really. I don't have trouble with that one, I do have trouble with the other thing you mentioned, which is...so wait a minute, you're saying you're distressed and I'm saying not. I think that, I guess for me though...like the eating disorders, where you have to have all of the criteria or you don't get the diagnosis, in hoarding you have to have all of the criteria. And so if the person says \"I'm distressed,\" I almost say, \"well you're not distressed enough if I don't see a hoard.\"\n",
      "Interviewer: So there's also this question in the diagnostic criteria, one of the criteria anyway reads, \"persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value.\" And I'm wondering, is it a requirement that some of the possessions in the hoard to be a hoard are not objectively valuable or that there's a determination of inappropriate valuation at some point. So either they're objectively worthless and the person thinks they're worth money, or there's things that the person is sentimentally attached to that it just doesn't kind of make sense to be so sentimentally attached to those particular items? I guess the reason that I'm asking this is that I read this really interesting article this morning about a couple who their home appeared to be totally hoarded out, they couldn't have people over, it was totally filled to the brim, but then they were found to actually be in the possession of a very valuable art collection, which they donated and was valued at millions of dollars. I mean it made their apartment totally non-functional for a decade, but when somebody actually went through the items, they found that they were excessively, they were actually really valuable works of art. And yes they were impairing the couple's use of the home, but it was appropriate for them to be saved because they were so valuable. Would that count as hoarding disorder? Is there an element of either lack of value in the objects or indiscriminateness in the saving? Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so the way I...I agree that that wording could be improved for sure. But when I see that criteria in driving that is this idea that nobody would just throw away their possessions indiscriminately, yet we would all get rid of some items. You know, the chopsticks that came with my sushi last night, I'm not gonna keep them because I have too many chopsticks already. And I think that the regardless of their, I forget how you said it was worded.\n",
      "Interviewer: Kind of to follow that up, different individuals--so one of the reasons I found your initial response to my question about how you can tell hoarding disorder to be so interesting, is that different people might like to have different amounts of stuff around them. So, I might like to have a totally clear desk, whereas my sister might really prefer a desk that's cluttered and she might say something like, \"well I think better when there are more items around me.\" And I wonder if you ever think of hoarding disorder as being an extension of that sort of concept, or maybe less about the individual items and more about the relationship between a person and objects in space. So, I like to be more enclosed, or they like to have a busier...I think the word they used is chaotic, you know they like to have things that they can look at and see everywhere around them; rather than somebody who prefers simplicity in their space.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think there's something to that. I don't know, however, how much of that is familiarity because hoarding is not an episodic problem and it didn't develop yesterday in the person. So, that's kind of in part what I was also meaning about the slow creep of the hoard, but their home has come to look and feel in a certain way. We have a hoarded room in my lab, and it really does look like a hoarded room, and there's a different smell about that room. There's no squalor in the room but there's kind of that dusty cardboard sort of smell and if that's the smell that you've come to associate with the home, then that would be a comforting smell. And there's also a different acoustic in that room than in the room next door, which is perfectly empty. And if that's the acoustic that you've come to associate with home, then that's gonna be appealing to you and having a lot less stuff in it is going to feel weird.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it's hard to tell whether it's just that you're accustomed to your space being that way, versus if that's really what you're trying to accomplish by making our space that way.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and I think that's part of what's relevant about having hoarding in your family, that if you grew up in a hoarded home then you've always had this kind of aesthetic around the home in terms of what the walls look like and what it sounds like and what is smells like.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, kind of speaking to the point that you've made about the creep of the hoard, a lot of the literature around hoarding suggests that patients with this disorder are older, although that might not be where it always starts. Do you have a sense with your patients how long it's been going on when they come to see you?\n",
      "Interviewee: Decades.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, so maybe it's not even a meaningful distinction for that reason.\n",
      "Interviewee: Not that I see it right now. Now it might be once we developed, if we could develop and identify a good biomarker of hoarding disorder, then you could begin to test that, right?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, the analogy that I was thinking of is like a compulsive disorder or like an impulse control problem, where you do something and you can't help but do it and then afterwards you think of a reason why you did it. And if hoarding is like that, if hoarding is a behavioral driven and then kind of afterwards cognitively driven or cognitively justified, but you're right that would be very difficult to test.\n",
      "Interviewee: I don't think it's testable currently. I'd be really interested if somebody found a way to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer: As a final question, I'm wondering if you have any idea from your patients and conversations with them how long their behavior's been going on and how it developed over the course of their life. Do they describe it as starting at a certain point? And I guess the reason I'm asking this is hoarding is, as you I'm sure know, if more prevalent in elderly people and I've wondered is that because of the social factors? Is that because those people tend to be more isolated and perhaps living alone and they've had the impulse or the behavior their whole life and it only reaches clinical levels as they get older and less able to deal with it? Do you have any idea about that from your patients?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so one thing I often talk about with my patients is differentiating between the difficulty they have in the way they relate to stuff, and the legacy in the years of accumulation, and I think there's inadequate weight given to that distinction. So that, for example, I will see many people who go through a course of CBT or an [INAUDIBLE 51:37] treasures protocol who at the end of it are relating to things differently, are more able to discard, are no longes excessively acquiring, are beginning to impose more of an organizational structure, and they're doing really well in terms of losing what comes in the door. And so if we look at them on the savings inventory or the hoarding rating scale, they would be clearly improved significantly. But, that doesn't mean that they don't still live in a home filled with dramatic clutter, because the legacy of years of accumulation is an overwhelming problem. Sorry I'm trying to think now what your question was.\n",
      "Interviewer: Actual value, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, regardless of their actual value, I think that they attempt to try to say things that other people would get rid of. But when you use that language to ask inner beauty, many of them would say, \"I don't know what other people look at.\" [laughs] So that's not good language, you can't use that one. But that's the way I see it, is in effort to say do you keep stuff that other people would get rid of? And I see that as thinking and being responsive to your space. Like do you keep stuff that other people would say, \"I'd rather have this space than this object in my life.\" And in terms of the paintings, how I would view that would depend on what else is in the home. Like if the paintings were the only thing in the home that was making someone think, \"Oh, this is hoarding\" then I might think it doesn't sound like hoarding to me.\n",
      "Interviewer: And is that because the person was only saving one sort of thing?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well that would make it certainly atypical for hoarding for sure. But also it would make it look more like a collection to me than hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, and just to kind of get myself clear, can you have a collection that takes up so much room in your house that you can't use the house? I mean, or could you hoard, I guess I'm still struggling with that distinction. Like if I had a toothpaste cap collection, and it filled my entire bathroom so I couldn't even wash my hands, how would I know if I had a collection or a hoard?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think that's a really good thing to be confused about. It's also one of those things where there's this unspoken kind of social norms at play. Toothpaste caps are not commonly accepted as a collectible, art is. Even weird little things like things that have ducks on them, are recognized. It might not be something that I would want to collect, but people collect them. And hoarding involves a collection of things that don't, like I could see a guy who collected these age-old vitamin bottles because...I mean they were empty, he had eaten the vitamins out of them, but they don't make them the same way anymore. They've changed the style of bottle for this vitamin, so he saw that as a collection but I didn't see that as a collection. And [INAUDIBLE 47:56] why not [laughs], that's where I kind of in depth thinking well because society doesn't say it's a collection.\n",
      "Interviewer: It's not a collectible.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, a collectible or something that someone would say, \"Oh an expression of my personality is in this collection, you know because I love ducks.\" Or this is an investment of mine, I've become an expert on this thing, I'm now an art expert and I now have a good eye for this particular kind of thing. And those sort of statements you can't really apply to toothpaste caps or vitamin bottles.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you couldn't be a vitamin bottle connoisseur.\n",
      "Interviewee: [laughs] Yeah, yeah and it would be different if he had a collection of different kinds of vitamin bottles, you know like different kind of bottles like you might see in an antique shop. But this was all one kind of vitamin bottle.\n",
      "28:47 Interviewer:\n",
      "But you you've resisted the urge to fill them with your items.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "28:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, is there anything else you can think of, like, for example, some people will not be able to use their bathtub, because there are so many objects.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, I see. Uh, no, no, no, we’re alright for that.\n",
      "29:12 Interviewer:\n",
      " Okay. Um, and then moving on to our next section, which is on value when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And I think their familiarity and their potential.\n",
      "29:27 Interviewer:\n",
      " Okay. So what is trash for you, like, what do you discard?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Into the trash? Something that's broken or something that's dirty, or stained. Something that… yeah\n",
      "29:53 Interviewer:\n",
      " So something that is just no longer and its original, like original state?\n",
      "Participant 059 30:00-\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "30:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And so, you've mentioned it before. Um, how your books and baskets are the most precious items in your house for you. So, what would happen if you lost them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well you know I think about that. Think about sharing. If I were going to share them even just not using them and it’s like, I feel distraught about that. [unclear] You know, I’d rather share money you know than share these things, which is interesting. They don't have a… I guess probably they're like hard to find. So, they would be difficult to replace with money, whereas money. I work right so I can replace the money, but things that are one off, odd things. I got at thrift stores and found you know hunting hunting and gathered and found a basket or this thing in a trash can, you know, so, so the value I guess is in the acquisition of it. It’s monetary value.\n",
      "31:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right so you value more the like the uniqueness and like, like you said, the acquisition more than more than necessarily even money.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right than the Monetary value of it.\n",
      "31:39 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Like my grandma with her stack of Penny Saver magazines are worth zero dollars when you could not get her to part with one of them, you know.\n",
      "31:56 Interviewer:\n",
      "And like you've mentioned you are aware that you have too much stuff. Um, but how do you know that, like, how do you decide when you have too much?\n",
      "13:13 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right so you would say that would attach feelings to inanimate objects to justify her saving or collecting tendencies.. And then that got caught on to you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, yeah. My grandma getting through that she just kept everything my grandma was like the fire hazard keeping all the magazines type of a person, but not because she felt sorry for him because he felt that she would need them. My mom wasn't a fire hazard person, but she had, you know. She had the little trail through that house, but, um, but all of those things had personality, everything had a personality. We've been growing out of clothes and it didn't want the clothes. It was, you know, “oh no [unclear] they’ll miss you.”  So, there wasn't a flow of items. It was like a backlog of items.\n",
      "Interviewer 14:20 I see. Okay, so maybe potentially poverty could also be a cause of hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant 059 14:27\n",
      "Oh, yes. I suppose so yes.\n",
      "14:30 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And how long has your hoarding disorder been going on for?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I’m 67 so I’d probably say maybe 50 years.\n",
      "Interviewer 14:44 -Okay. And I know that you've mentioned that your behavior isn't as severe. But do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I think that it is a problem. Yes my behavior is a problem because I've had to move several times and it's exhausting moving. And, especially common things that are easily replaceable and multiple things. So, it’s a problem, because; whereas if I had, If I had the correct number of things, all my things would fit in all the drawers that. But there are things on the counter that could be in the cupboard or in a drawer. But there are on the counter, because there isn't room in the drawer and that's not a problem. But I mean, it doesn't need to be considered a problem. It’s work for cleaning where as if it was empty it would be easier for cleaning so it just causes more work and more slowing down, and which is unnecessary. There are already five can openers.\n",
      "Interviewer 16:17 Okay. Um, so you believe that your behavior is a problem because it creates unnecessary difficulties that that shouldn't be there.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And extra work extra.\n",
      "16:34 Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that this behavior like you've gotten better through time, like your behavior, used to be more severe or…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, I guess my behavior would have been more severe because I was because I didn't have a partner who was who felt strongly about limits to items and adversity to shopping or stopping a car to look through a trash can.\n",
      "17:18 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, you would say that you would attribute the decreasing of the severity of your hoarding disordered due to your partner because he decreases you're collecting tendencies.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you think of a case or cases that you thought was really challenging to diagnose or challenging to determine if the person truly had hoarding disorder or not and could you describe an instance like that for me?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I can tell you about a case from last week. So this was a young woman, maybe in her 30s, she had moved into her apartment maybe only 8 months earlier, so she hadn't lived there very long. It's a very small apartment, her kitchen and living room were kind of all together like in one area, and her bedroom was a separate room, and the photos of the kitchen itself, like the place where you would prepare food and store things did not look hoarded at all. It looked extremely functional in the kitchen, but once you stepped away from the counters, there were piles of things that were more disorganized, but she described the things as not being hers or being temporarily there. Like for example, there were some closet doors that she said belonged to the landlord. And I have a hard time knowing when somebody says that, that this object is temporarily there it just belongs to someone else, I have a hard time knowing how to evaluate that in the context of hoarding because people tell themselves stories about objects in their homes. About, oh yes this belongs to someone else, and they kind of...the fact that is has sat there for a while and it's actually going to sit there for the next five years is not part of the story that they tell themselves. So, I don't quite know how to evaluate it. The most problematic room was her bedroom, however, where the mattress was on the floor and there was no visible floor space in the entire length of the room and she described this situation as being due to the fact that in the previous apartment, her bed had been a loft and she hadn't yet been able to get a bed up on a loft because it takes 3 people to handle the loft. And that under the bed, once the loft was there, would be perfect storage space for all this stuff that was in her bedroom. The things in her bedroom included bikes and quite a large pile of pillows that was not actually on her bed, and the photos made it clear that she actually sleeps on a tiny part of the bed because the rest of the bed is covered with stuff. And so it, partly because the photo was of a bed on the floor, so like if your bed is up, like my bed is a couple feet above the floor, that means that if my possessions were at the height of the bed, that would be two and a half feet of debris. But her bed was on the floor, so it made it look a little fuller than it was. But it's still true that you couldn't walk in it, and she said she couldn't walk over to the other side of the bedroom, so I have a really hard time trying to sort out, especially because different areas of the home had different functional abilities. Like the bedroom looked pretty not functional, the kitchen looked perfectly functional. So yeah, that was a hard one for me.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Very simple, somebody gave me something. And I know how I feel when somebody gives me something. I expect you to keep it. Its just the fact that, you know, I love you enough to do that. So that’s why I feel that I want to portray to somebody else that I really appreciate that. You get that balloon out, I wanna keep it. So, you know what I do that’s strange. Somebody will give me a balloon for mother’s day, I’ll let that thing fly until it hits the ground. It’ll be December and that thing is still flying until it hits the ground. Then I’ll cut it and I’ll hold it away.\n",
      "19:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yup.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, that’s what I do.\n",
      "19:17 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. And what is trash for you? Like what do you discard?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh trash. Stuff that’s dirty, smelly, broken, I don’t keep nothing broken.\n",
      "19:35 Interviewer:\n",
      "ok. So anytime its actually considered trash you will throw it away.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. I mean Yes, yeah I’m not going to keep something like that.\n",
      "19:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. And do you think you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "19:50 Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you know that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Actually yes. I really, it’s something my daughter said “Mom, take a picture of it. Then you can have all they nice pictures and you won’t have all this stuff in your drawers.” and stuff like that. You know but I still at sometimes, I like looking at it. I don’t want to pull up a picture. Here’s another thing. I think what shocks me, in my lifetime my family has lost photos twice in our life. Once they were stolen, and once they were left behind. You can’t get pictures back from grandmothers.\n",
      "20:28 Interviewer:\n",
      "so you’d say that a reason why you\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Pictures are crap\n",
      "20:33 Interviewer:\n",
      "Keep your things so much is that you don’t; you can’t rely on photos.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know what else I hoard. Now that you make me; files on my computer. You know I don’t just have a pile of pictures. I’ll take my pictures and I’ll put them in a file. I put them on a cd and I put them on a thumb drive. Believe it or not in three places.\n",
      "20:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Hmm. Just because you…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So that’s\n",
      "20:57 Interviewer:\n",
      "Can’t trust physical photos.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yup. That was a [unclear] (21:00). That’s a trigger. I don’t want to lose my pictures again.\n",
      "21:03 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right. Ok. If you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh man now you got me upset. That triggers\n",
      "21:21 Interviewer:\n",
      "I’m sorry. Would you like to skip that question?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "that was unnecessary. Why did it do that? Why did that question do that? I don’t like to be… I’m okay, I’m okay.\n",
      "21:35 Interviewer:\n",
      "We can skip it.\n",
      "Interviewer: SO like, \"I might become a person who can repair this printer and the printer might get fixed.\"\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, yes, exactly. I also sometimes see a kind of distortions around, \"I might repair this piece of clothing.\" And in my world, I would love it if I repaired clothing, but I know I don't. [laughs] I just don't because they're just not suitable for wearing. I either give them away or throw them away. But only because I could put it aside for mending but I will never do it.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it's that step that people are kind of lacking, the ability to know what they themselves are likely to do in the future with objects.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, it's like they operate on a should.\n",
      "Interviewer: And it's less like, \"I have this broken printer and I really believe that this printer is worth $1000, I truly have this unreasonable belief in the value of this clearly worthless item,\" and more that I truly believe that someday I might repair the printer and then the printer might be worth $1000. So it's less like a truly unreasonable belief in the actual value of the item at this moment?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it's, you know I do see a lot of statements about there could be some value like somebody will want this VCR. But I don't often hear people spontaneously coming up with [INAUDIBLE 1:13:31] and I think if we start talking about well why do you think a person would be willing to pay and do you think a person would be willing to pay that amount, then I think they would soften up more easily. But because they remain vague, it's worth something not worth nothing, then that's what keeps the object in their home.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it's more of a distinction between worth and worthless, rather than $200 vs $2.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and I think most people have some level of valuation, and that level might depend on your economic circumstances. At some level, when an object falls below that they'll say, \"I'm just gonna donate it, it's not even worth my time to figure out who might pay me.\n",
      "Interviewer: And they just don't have that threshold at all.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you ever encountered individuals who have this problem with animals? Who are animal hoarders?\n",
      "Interviewee: I have not clinically. My sister rescues cats, and there was a time when she, I felt she was teetering on the edge of cat hoarding. She never flipped over and I had some serious conversations with her and ever since then she's not been near that edge again, but I know animal hoarding is not something I can personally work with, so I don't have much direct experience with it.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Ok because ok my house could be a lot neater but I want things around me. But I would say 7 seven and a half.\n",
      "Interviewer 9:52- Ok seven and a half. Ok. And why would you say it’s a seven and a half like in comparison to you other, other times?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I know my other rooms, my kitchen, my bathroom, stuff like that, there’s not stuff in there. It’s neat; clean. It’s where I am all the time and it looks really piled up.\n",
      "10:21 Interviewer:\n",
      "And where are you most of the time?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I’m in my living room and I work out of my living room. So, I work on Ebay so I two big, huge bins  in the living room and I’ve got my Ebay stuff stacked in the corner. I’m sitting in a chair right now, there’s a bookshelf beside me with piles. But, I know where everything is. People will look at it and say, “How do you find anything?” I put my hand right on it. But if you look in your place and say “where is that pile?”\n",
      "10:51 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Is this making sense?\n",
      "10:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes. Completely.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "and I feel comfortable with my stuff around me.\n",
      "10:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "So to other people it would appear like it’s a mess, but to you it all makes perfect sense\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh yeah everything’s there.\n",
      "11:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "11:12 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah it actually is because I live with my husband; I live with my brother and it causes problems with other people because number one they live here and the house is cluttered with my stuff. Or they can’t move around. You know the living room would be a lot bigger if I didn’t have big huge forty gallon bins in here.  But I have my Ebay stuff in there. I could put it in another room but I want it here.\n",
      "11:40 Interviewer:\n",
      "So you believe that your behavior is a problem because it affects other people\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Other people [unclear]\n",
      "11:46 Interviewer:\n",
      " If they weren’t in the equation would you want; would you consider the behavior a problem for yourself?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. Actually no. It’s comforting to me. Is that fair?\n",
      "11:58 Interviewer:\n",
      "I think that’s fair.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Now if I had trash on the floor and you know fast food things and that yeah that would [unclear] but I don’t do that. I just have stuff around me. I don’t have no garbage around me.\n",
      "12:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. And have you ever sought to change this behavior? Like gone to a professional for help?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. I mean no. You know what I do? I keep telling myself “One day [name], you going to move into a bigger place. You can have this one room for your hoarding, office, clutter room.” And then it makes me feel better.\n",
      "12:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Interview 020\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so now we're gonna move onto the open-ended part of this interview. So just to begin, if you wouldn't mind setting the stage for me by briefly telling me your background related to hoarding disorder, your educational background, and whether you are a clinician who sees patients of a researcher or both.\n",
      "Interviewee: So I'm an MD psychiatrist, I'm a clinician investigator. I've been working in the area of OCD since doing a fellowship in 1992 and in practice since 1992. I'm an academic who does research primarily on neurobiology, mainly genetics, of OCD and spectrum disorders, as well as developmental treatments and improving outcomes with treatment. My experience is primarily in OCD for the first 10-15 years of my career, and then gradually more inclusively to focus as well on OCD-related disorders. So, for the last 15 years or so, clinically working more with hoarding disorder, trichotillomania, and skin-picking disorder. I developed, I ran, I started running group protocols for CBT for hoarding and so I see individual cases for psychopharmacology and to some extent, for some individuals CBT typically limited by time constraints. I started running CBT groups for hoarding disorder about 10 years ago now, probably run about 8-10 CBT groups, began working on... I did training with [NAME 9:27] about 8 years ago. Let me think... limited research, trying to develop community initiatives to work with our community agency so that they would be more informed in the cluttering aspects that they had going by a CBT model, I've done extensive teaching in the community, I've co-organized or organized about 7 to 8 hoarding conferences, and about 8 OCD conferences in which we usually have a hoarding sub focus with seminars or workshops on hoarding. I've been consulted by a number of local, well Ontario actually, widely community groups, coalitions that they form, um, yeah, currently running more of a hurried treasure professionally lead, morphed model of group therapy for our clients here for our patients here.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, thank you for that. Um, so it sounds like you have a very broad experience, both with individual patients, with research, and with working with communities. So, for the first part of our interview, we're trying to focus on how you conceive of hoarding as a disorder, how you diagnose it, how you know it when you see it. And then we're going to move to the discussion of insight, and the purpose of this process is to understand how clinicians are looking at hoarding disorder, and then to talk to patients about how they identify the disorder in themselves and the purpose of that is to help understand the patient process of gaining insight. So, for you as a clinician, what are some of the most important differences between normal saving behavior, such as perhaps collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: So the excessive accumulation of material to the point that it impairs their ability to function. It's not organized as in a collection, it's not useful as in a collection, it takes over and impairs their ability to function. People with hoarding disorder typically are distressed by it, unlike collectors, and describe difficulty discarding, which collectors will not except perhaps in relation to the enlargement of their collection and material that may be a little peripheral to it. Excessive acquiring of items.\n",
      "060\n",
      "Interviewer 0:06- Ok, so to start off as you know this study is investigating individual’s attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. So the first question I’d like to ask you is what term would you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding? Are you ok with hoarding disorder or would you prefer another term?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No hoarding disorder is fine.\n",
      "Interviewer 0:36- Ok great\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I mean I know why I [unclear] (0:39). But it is called hoarding; you can’t hide it.\n",
      "Interviewer 7:28- Ok. Thank you. So now we are going to be moving on to the next part of our interview which is just normal more conversational questions. So, could you please describe your hoarding disorder? How long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I want to say when I got into my teens because I [unclear](7:55) so I time everything around and then when I got married at a young age I didn’t have my stuff; I couldn’t get my stuff. There was even a time where I was actually without food, without that and I think that was when it really started.  Because if I don’t keep and I don’t have it and I see it, I want it. And let me tell you I don’t know if this is me talking to you right now in this conversation but if I go to the store, I will get things I don’t need, thinking I’m going to need them later. And I know that’s hoarding because when I bring it home, it sits. You know it just sits there. So, I just wanted; you know I started in my teens. I started to accumulate stuff and then I lost stuff. I was afraid. I was afraid that I would lose the chance to get stuff I wanted when I could see it. You would actually go nuts if you came over here right now. It’s not cluttered; it is cluttered but on my desk I don’t have a desk.\n",
      "9:03 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have a chair in the living room with stuff around it.\n",
      "Interviewer 9:06- So you’d say that your hoarding is more because of you just want to make sure that you have everything and you don’t lose anything?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes and I don’t lose it. You know I just want it near me. I want to be able to [unclear] for it.\n",
      "Interviewer 9:20- And you said that this started maybe when you were in your teens?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 9:25- Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I had everything then I lost it.\n",
      "Interviewer 9:30- How severe would you say that this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well for me, I mean, it’s actually if I had to do a one to ten I would say maybe a seven and a half.\n",
      "Interviewer 9:44- Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, my daughter. And the therapist labeled her as a hoarder. This was oh my god about 10 years ago. So that’s when her depression got really bad. And I just never really heard [unclear] (27:46). About ten years ago. Hoarders and I used the logic I was like oh my god such pigs. But then I look at me and go [name] such a pig. You know? But at least I didn’t have the garbage. I felt lucky. And you can open my front door, because at my daughter’s you can’t. Man, you could not. She had to crawl over. Just imagine. Oh yeah\n",
      "28:16 Interviewer:\n",
      "And what do you think about when you hear the words “hoarding disorder”?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "you’re breaking up.\n",
      "28:24 Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you hear me?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Ok so you’re breaking up, so I don’t know if it’s you or…\n",
      "28:30 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ummm\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Now you’re ok.\n",
      "28:31 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok good.  What do you think about when you hear the words “hoarding disorder”?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[unclear] (28:38-28:40). And I don’t consider myself mental. I really don’t. I’m not depressed. I used to have major anxiety but it’s kind of controlled now. I’m a very happy person, really, I am. So mentally ill. That’s it.\n",
      "28:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I used to think pig. You know, trashy people. I used to think that before my own daughter became one. And I knew she wasn’t. And I knew where it came from.\n",
      "29:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "So it was that personal connection that changed your insight.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. Other than that I was like “oh my god you slob.” So that changed real quick.\n",
      "29:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. And now we are moving into the last section of our interview which talks about distress and interference of hoarding disorder that will have in your daily life. So does your hoarding disorder upset you? Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Ugh. Not per say get in my way. No, it doesn’t. It just causes anxiety sometimes because I’ll wake up sometimes and “oh my god, what a mess.” I love… I was raised in a clean house.  And it’s you know, my mother, my mother would fall over if she saw this. [unclear]. I’m sorry about that, I keep, I keep making you think it’s really bad but it’s not really. I don’t know I don’t have an answer to that.\n",
      "30:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "So you don’t, you wouldn’t say that it gets in the way of your daily life.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No because my other rooms are fine.\n",
      "30:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "My yard’s fine. My porch is fine.\n",
      "30:24 Interviewer:\n",
      "Could you think of a time where your hoarding disorder got in the way of something you wanted?\n",
      "Interviewer: I mean, it's unusual as a disorder--and we're gonna talk about this in just a minute, so maybe I'll hold off on that comment. Before I ask you that, do you find that it's difficult to make the distinction between hoarding disorder and other mental health disorders that might result in accumulating items? So depression, you know being too depressed to really clean up after yourself or being obsessive compulsive and having fears related to throwing things away. Do you find that that's a difficult distinction to make?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say it's not a difficult distinction in my research or in our treatment program, I don't find that to be difficult at all. But I do think it could be difficult in the community setting, because the community let's say is having providers or something like that, they're not really making diagnosis and I'll bear with them in oh there's unsafe conditions here, and being able to figure out what's the appropriate intervention, it differs if it's unsafe because the person is so depressed they can't clean up after themselves. Or if it's unsafe because the person is trying to run bicycle track shop to feed their drug addiction. You know, it's different intervention. Like I think sometimes those are harder, probably wouldn't be very hard if it was a clinician making the judgement, but they're not. They're people from different backgrounds and training and it is hard for them.\n",
      "Interviewer: And it's not difficult for you as a clinician because you find it very easy to kind of talk to a person for a little while and figure out on the basis of their motivation for saving, why they're--which disorder they have?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and also what they're saving.\n",
      "Interviewer: How so?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know because it--well, I come across people who are very poor and they're saving things to sell and they're not saving the same kinds of things. And actually they actually do sell them, unlike someone with hoarding who might say, \"oh I intend to sell them\" but nothing ever proceeds. And also I think the presence of, so in cases where I've seen where I thought this is really depression, it isn't hoarding, the accumulation of things really looked much more like garbage. You know like old ice cream containers and other items where the person has clearly been sitting in front of the television just having a [INAUDIBLE 35:44] and just setting the container down and you could see that that had happened for many days in a row. So it doesn't look like intentionally saved containers, like somebody might wash out their containers and might have 150 of them. But they're not just discarded with the food still in them right by the bed.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you can kind of see that the person hasn't necessarily decided to save them, they've just fallen where they fall.\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer: Now we're gonna talk a little bit more through the diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder, and before I start to ask specific questions about those criteria, do you have any thoughts as to part of the criteria that you have found difficult to apply or that you have thought different clinicians might apply differently or that rely on clinical judgement?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think one of the challenges I have in training graduate students to diagnose hoarding, one of the difficulties I have is that they sometimes get so distracted by the psychological aspects of the diagnostic criteria, that they forget there's got to be a hoard.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know something? this is really weird like if you see them outside your house; like we’ll be driving around, we’ll be in a parking lot. I can tell who’s a hoarder by their car. Their dash is just like everything. They have tons of crap in their car and I’ve seen it with my whole family. My car gets like that. In my van, I have a box that shouldn’t be in there but it’s got books to read if I have to wait, it’s got a crossword puzzle. Something’s in there that shouldn’t be in there. But I want it there. You know? So, that’s one way. Another way too, I noticed how people dress. You’ll see some people with 10-12 necklaces on and bracelets because they can’t decide what they want to do. I notice is a lot, you know, with people and they’re all hoarders. Because I’ve met them and talked to them. And they’ll tell me “I didn’t know what to wear.” So, that’s the only thing I’ve got for you.\n",
      "25:30 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok, so you can spot if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their homes based on how their car looks, like the interior of their car and how people dress because it conveys a sense of undecidedness.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah undecided that’s the word. Thank you.\n",
      "25:49 Interviewer:\n",
      "Mhm. Ok let’s see. Where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Actually, I don’t because I never thought it was a problem of mine. I actually didn’t start to think about hoarding until my daughter was very, very depressed. Not now she isn’t, but she retired not this January but last January here at the library. You would have saw her house that’s what said, we’ll talk about her after this, [unclear] (26:21-26:24) wasn’t raised the way she was living. And she was [unclear], her expression you know, then I’d try to read up on depression hoarding and stuff like that. That’s how I thought about me. So, I felt like I was a hoarder. I would have thought I was a saver. So, a saver is not a hoarder.\n",
      "26:52 Interviewer:\n",
      "True.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You know? I save things but if you over-save things you cross the fence.\n",
      "26:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "So did you do most of your reading from internet sources or books?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Internet. Talking to people. I’m a very talkative person. I’ll talk to people in line. Stuff like that. Yeah, I really researched. Oh my god I’m a big research person. I research everything. So, yeah. It’s something I like to do.\n",
      "27:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you first heard of hoarding disorder from reading about it, you said?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "My son is totally different from the rest of us.\n",
      "33:46 Interviewer:\n",
      "So you would like to change your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I really would like to be that, organizer. That’s what I want to use. I would want to be an organizer. I’ve watched a few YouTube videos on it. You know, that one Chinese lady. Just to see how you do this. You know? So yeah I would.\n",
      "34:06 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. So, I know you mentioned that you would; that you like are very attached to your sentimental and your nostalgic items. So, would you be upset it you had to get rid of some of your items? Like if something happened…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I wouldn’t want to throw myself of a bridge. I have no wedding pictured whatsoever because mold got on them. But what it was it made me mad it didn’t make me hurt. You know? So that didn’t hurt that bad. So anytime I hear “[name] you can’t have this” I would actually get upset and say let me deal with it first. And I would try to shove as much stuff as I could in less containers. Seriously, I would. I would work it out some way. See that would upset me.\n",
      "35:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But not make me, you know, want to kill myself.\n",
      "35:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It would just make me; It would make your life uncomfortable. But that way.\n",
      "35:16 Interviewer:\n",
      " Ok. So, that was the last question. So, now we just need to get some demographics. So, what is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female, straight. Is that how you say it?\n",
      "35:33 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Ok. Was that your sex…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I know what I am.\n",
      "35:37 Interviewer:\n",
      "Was that your sex assigned at birth? Was female?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh huh.\n",
      "35:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "ok. What’s your race?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "White, I guess. I don’t want to say I guess. I’m Italian.\n",
      "35:52 Interviewer:\n",
      "Italian.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "But I don’t look like Italian. So I’m white.\n",
      "35:55 Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "36:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "And then could you give me a general household income? Just like a ballpark?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So it’s like maybe 35 to 45 a year.\n",
      " 36:13 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok. Um and a geographic region in the United States? So, northeast, south, west, Midwest.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "south.\n",
      "36:23 Interviewer:\n",
      "South, ok.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I live; put [State].\n",
      "36:30 Interviewer:\n",
      "And the highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Some college. I went to three years of law school.\n",
      "36:37 Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh ok. Um, did you complete a bachelor’s degree?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. We lived in [State] and my grandmother got a stroke. We moved to [state] because it was easier for her insurance. I, went to University of Florida wanting to go to their law school and I lost all my credits because it was a different state. So they sent me to Santa Fe and I just fumbled around.\n",
      "37:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "ok.\n",
      "Interviewer: And how do you make that determination about value when somebody is saying to you something about the sentimental value of an item? How do you determine if it's an appropriate or inappropriate sentimental valuation? So you know, somebody saying I can't throw away this box of baby clothes because my daughter wore them when she was a baby. Is that a matter of sort of extent?\n",
      "Interviewee: For me, that's why I come back to being responsive to the space available. So a person who is living in a big house where they raised their children, it's not uncommon for people to have an area of the basement that has their kid's possessions, they might want it someday. But if it's interfering with their living space, most people...very few people keep every single thing their baby ever touched. There's some decisions along the way of stuff you gotta get rid of, and so where you draw the line seems to me to be around the space you have available.\n",
      "Interviewer: One of the other criteria reads, \"the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.\" And I'm thinking about, for example the example that you gave earlier of the woman who had her countertops totally clear and thus was not compromising the intended use of her kitchen, but what if I gave you a counter example where her clutter extended to the countertops but she said, \"I don't know how to cook and I don't have any cooking supplies, and so this is how I want to use my kitchen counters because I'll never use them for cooking.\" How do you determine that kind of intended use? I mean you could again extend that example outward and say, \"I don't have any guests, so why do I need a guest room? I only shower so I don't need a bathtub.\" You know, you could extend out to the point of absurdity, but how do you draw the line on a patient by patient basis?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, yeah so I think that's a really good question you're making and it sounds like you're implicitly noting that people will make accommodations in their lives and then use the fact that they've made an accommodation to the symptom as a kind of a rationalization. Like this isn't really that big of a problem because I don't paint it big. And I would say that if I see one example of something like that in the home, where the person is saying, \"well I don't really cook so it doesn't matter that my stove is covered in stuff\" if that was all I saw was just the one example, I might go, \"Okay,\"but usually we see many more examples. That's what I would be looking for and I think that's one of the things that troubles me about that case that I gave you, is that I only really see the bedroom being impairment, and so that troubles me.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sound like the biggest difference in your mind that there are kind of maybe, it sound like from what you just said maybe two main differences. One is that the items themselves are so excessive and exist in a disordered state that they can really impair the person's ability to function; while in a collection, you wouldn't expect such excessive acquisition and they would be more organized and it wouldn't impair function. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and displayed suitably, maintained, controlled, yeah. Without the difficulty discarding, generally speaking, that we see in hoarders. So in hoarders, I look for a pervasive difficulty discarding, saving of everything, it's not thematically connected, it's not necessarily a collection at all, it has nothing to do with collecting, often the presence of insight, the recognition that it's excessive themselves but not always.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you have a person with hoarding disorder who hoards particular items? So, somebody who fills their home completely with cuckoo clocks or clown memorabilia. So, I guess what I'm getting at is is the non-discriminant aspect a key, or is it possible to have a patient with hoarding disorder who is discriminating to come extent, along the lines of the ways that a collector might?\n",
      "Interviewee: I guess I've seen some who have that, I mean usually all hoarders gravitate to certain kinds of material. So, if it's newspaper I don't think most people would think of it as collecting, but I've also seen hoarders who's collection, one guy for example, who collected model cars. But, again, his accumulation of cars was excessive, he had multiples of cars, they had overtaken his home to the point that he could not live in it appropriately, could not have people over, was worried about it being a fire hazard and getting inspected, he identified himself as unable to discard things or part with things. And so, even though there was a thematic connection, and some qualities in common with a collector, it went way beyond.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you think of ever encountering a case or cases that was really on the borderline and was challenging to diagnose for that reason, where you were really unsure if it was hoarding disorder or not?\n",
      "Interviewee: hoarding vs. collecting? No.\n",
      "Interviewer: Hoarding versus collecting, no never?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I don't think so actually.\n",
      "Interviewer: How about on the boarder between hoarding and an alternative diagnosis, such as OCD or depression? Do you find that distinction to be difficult to make sometimes clinically?\n",
      "Interviewee: Generally not, generally not. I certainly will see a lot of hoarding disorder that is comorbid and exasperated by OCD, and I will see people with OCD who accumulate because of their OCD where I don't think it's hoarding, so I certainly see all the gray zones in there. I don't find that one causes me a whole lot of difficulty, generally speaking.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes sense. The last little kind of topic that I'd like to touch on before I let you go, and again I really appreciate your time this has been a wonderful conversation, is about insight. So a lot of the literature describes people with hoarding disorder having particularly low insight, and I'd first just like to ask how you would define insight in the context of hoarding disorder? Like what does it mean to have insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: So I would say insight is an ability to make an assessment of the conditions in the home and the consequences of the hoarding behavior that reasonably well mirrors what another person's assessment would be. And I've heard a description of home in general as the place where you can only see it through a stranger's eyes for a sheer second. So all of us have poor insight of our homes. I don't know if you've had the occasion, like if you come back from vacation, you've been away from home for a while, and then there's this one little moment where you see your home as an outsider would and then boom it's gone, and it's just home.\n",
      "Interviewer: I definitely had that experience, yup. Like, \"oops I have to clean.\"\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhmm, I have to clean or even if you left it perfectly clean, just the slight difference like, \"Oh this is an inviting space\" or \"Oh wow that's really irritating\" or whatever it is, but you experience it not in your habitual home way but as an independent observer would look at it.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, insight for you with hoarding disorder is the ability to have that moment to look at your space and see it as somebody who is not accustomed to it would see it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, maybe not quite that broad because I think that's a very rare moment. I can tell you the ways in which my garage is functional and not functional and you would probably agree with me if you looked at my garage. And it's that kind of concurrence of ability to evaluate it, not even just the affective response of what it feels like to be in the space, but how useful is this space? How clean is it?\n",
      "Interviewer: So, insight is the ability for someone to be able to tell you that in a way that some objective observer would agree with.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, you have kind of a shared perception of what's going on there.\n",
      "Interviewer: Does it involve kind of the desire to change it? So if I'm a person who's home is completely hoarded out and I say, \"Yeah I recognize that somebody else might really hate this space and it's gross, but I don't want to change it. I like it the way it is and I'm gonna live in it this way and I'm happy with it.\" Am I a person with low insight or with high insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I would say that's independent, because I've certainly talked to people who like maybe they make just enough change in treatment to satisfy whoever was threatening them, and they don't want to go any further because actually they are not bothered by it. They can see it, but it's fine with them. They'd rather live with it than make changes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Because you would look for multiple ways that the space was being compromised by the items and just one might not be enough but you'd want to look and see is the amount of stuff really impairing the person's use of their home beyond this single example, and is it extended to multiple examples.\n",
      "Interviewee: That's right, and also I would be looking to satisfy myself if, are they telling me a story about who they are as a person and that's real and that would be true even if they didn't have stuff, or are they telling me a story of how they've accommodated to their symptoms?\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess that you could ask that same question in kind of a larger way about this disorder. I mean, do you feel that when somebody tells you, \"I'm saving this item because I might use it someday or I'm afraid to waste it,\" do you feel like they're justifying the fact that they have already decided to save it? Like is the symptom \"I have to save things\" and then they come up with reasons sort of post-hoc to justify that behavior? Or do you feel like it's the reasoning that's driving the saving behavior? Does that make sense as a question?\n",
      "Interviewee: That's a good question, I don't know the answer to that...I really don't.\n",
      "Interviewer: It's something that I wonder a lot about with hoarding symptoms because the answers--the reasons that people give for why they're saving are so uniform, it really makes me wonder are these just the reasons that we as a society have decided it's appropriate to save, so when somebody is compulsively saving are they just reciting the reasons that that might be okay, or are their reasons more psychological and more cognitive and more driving? You know is it more similar to an obsessive-compulsive disorder where they're really worried about memory and poverty and things they might need?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I can think of it around kind of being a good person, and a good person is prepared for emergencies and a good person is true to their artistic selves and a good person doesn't waste things. And whichever one of those reason for saving kind of talks to their sense of \"I'm a good person.\" I'm hesitant to totally disregard that as a rationalization of the behavior, but it certainly looks like that and smells like that at times but I just don't really know.\n",
      "Interviewer: I want to be respectful of your time, this has been really a wonderful conversation and I do have more questions for you but I know that I'm taking up more time than I asked for, so if you have to go please just let me know and I'll wrap up, okay?\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: So insight isn't related necessarily to the desire for treatment or the desire to change their behavior, insight is simply the ability to know that their behavior departs from the norm. And then separate form that is the desire to fix the behavior or to make their home different, to discard, all that is not insight, it's more like willingness for treatment.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I would agree with all of that except for the parting with the norm, in that my partner, for example, will often stay up very late working, and she knows it's bad for her. She knows that if she's been working on the computer she's not going to sleep well that night, she knows that her work is slower at 2 in the morning, but she persists in doing it. So she doesn't actually have a desire to change, but she has excellent insight about the consequences of this behavior. So I wouldn't say deviations from the norm, so much as I would say they can realistically evaluate the consequences.\n",
      "Interviewer; So it's not that the behavior's unusual so much as recognizing that the behavior is impairing.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, it has some consequence or what it is. Like she didn't say, \"Oh I never go to bed after midnight\" when in fact she goes to bed at 2. She would say, \"I go to bed at 2.\" And that's what I call insight.\n",
      "Interviewer: With your patients who have lower insight, do you find that their lack of insight is more like a psychosis in the sense that they can't reality perceive reality? Like they will insist on things that are just really apparently not true, like \"I can't throw away this piece of trash because it is worth tons of money\" and that's kins of like a nonsensical belief, you know, it's an easily disprovable belief. Or do you feel like they don't have those kinds of--or another way of asking that question is are they able to perceive their spaces? Will they deny that their spaces are full? Or is it more that they can see the stuff but they don't recognize that it's truly as extreme as it is or that other people's homes don't look like that?\n",
      "Interviewee: I actually think they fluctuate. I think it's synched with a desire for items, they might say, \"Oh I've got plenty of space to live\" and truly believe it at the time. They'll also be able to sit in the middle of their room and say, \"there's no space in here, it's too full\" at a different time.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, at some points their beliefs might resemble...they might depart from reality in obvious ways, but it changes and sometimes they are able to kind of see the reality of the situation.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and the kind of departures from reality, the main departure from reality I see is one that we all indulge in, and that is thinking that they're going to become a different person in the future. Like not using their own past behavior of a good judge of how they're going to continue behaving in the future.\n",
      "Interviewer: Interesting, so almost like a kind of optimism.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, an optimism about what kind of changes are going to occur, and I might do this but the fact that I haven't done it in the past 10 years are not informing my judgement about that.\n",
      "059\n",
      "00:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, as you know, this study is investigating individual’s attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. So, the first question would be what term you prefer, when we were talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, what term out of any terms.\n",
      "00:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Like some people prefer like problems with clutter, or they're fine with hoarding disorder or they…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. You can say hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer 09: 22- Okay, thank you. Um, so now we're going to be moving on to the second part of the interview, that's much more conversational. So, I'll just be asking you questions and then you just respond with how you think. Um, so the first section is just about your behavior and treatment seeking. So, could you please describe your hoarding disorder to me?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "My hoarding disorder is not as severe as my family's, my mother and my grandmother’s was, but I do find that I am I don't consider myself a collector, but I consider myself more of a sorter. So, if I find something like at the goodwill, or at a garage sale or at side of the road that belongs in the family, then I feel compelled to Pick it up and take it with me. I see something useful that's in the trash, then I am compelled to take it, take it out. If I find something that, if I see a good deal on something that I don't actually even need might need, then I would buy it. Don't have any problem with the amount of space that I have. Mostly because my husband is very strong about wanting, needing to have order. But if I were on my own, I probably would have A bit more of a chaotic collection. And also, because my husband doesn't like shopping really. He doesn’t like to go shopping, he doesn’t enjoy that. I don't go shopping or out to shops or goodwill or garage sales as much as I would if I wasn't with this partner and so I feel like my hoarding is under control. But by my by circumstance.\n",
      "11:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, you mentioned that you have other families that also have hoarding does. Do you think that that may have contributed to the development of your own hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, definitely. Definitely. And through and emotionally, through an emotional way because my mother and grandmother came Out of that situation of poverty when they were growing up. And so, their attachment to it was very much out of fear of not having enough and so although I haven't ever had any experience of poverty or lack, my mom giving personalities to everything, and feeling sorry for everything, and saying about hurting his feelings has made it difficult for me to discard things.\n",
      "13:08 Interviewer:\n",
      "Ok so you would say that…\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because it was learned emotionality\n",
      "Interviewer: With your patients who are object hoarders, do you feel like there is an impact of kind of increased national dialogue of climate change and environmentalism on their behavior or the way they talk about their behavior? So do you have people who say, \"I can't discard because there's too much trash in the world and this will end up in a landfill or in the ocean.\"\n",
      "Interviewee: I see that it hearkens back to a question you asked earlier about which drives which, and a belief driving the behavior or the belief being applied later. I see that as an example of a reason acquired later. I remember when I first started learning to treat OCD, it was in the late 80s and early 90s and HIV was a very big threat. And it seemed like every patient came in and the contamination fears were always about HIV. I feel it's more like that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So that's kind of like a disorder picking up a sort of characteristic fear or anxiety that is circulating societally, and is just manifesting in that way.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, it goes back to that dying person. Dying people don't care about the environment, I should care about the environment, so I'm gonna be responsible with this VCR.\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you seen an increase in people who endorse those kind of environmentalist beliefs? Maybe in the past couple of year as compared to before that?\n",
      "Interviewee: I'd say the only way I've seen an increase in that is related to perfectionism around recycling. We do a lot of recycling, so it's actually pretty easy to recycle most things but that last 10% of things is hard to recycle. But because we recycle 90%, when you get plastics that actually don't fit what is taken out in the weekly recycling, that's why I see that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well I really appreciate your time today, that's all the questions that I had for you and I have very much enjoyed your extremely thoughtful responses, so thank you so much for your time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, about the life course kind of of hoarding disorder and how it is impacted by age.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so the reason I was mentioning that, which I think is a real problem in the way we often understand hoarding and I think it's a real problem with patients who understand hoarding that leads them to minimize the gains in treatment or to see them as relatively lacking in value because that legacy is still there, is that often the insight only seems to develop as a result of those years of the legacy of the accumulation. So, many people I see will say when they look back absolutely as it's been reported in other studies, you know they identified difficulty with discarding going back to their early adult years or teens or sometimes even late childhood, but the accumulation took time to get out of control and quite often I find hoarders that I see who are usually in their 40s to 60s, although I've seen some younger ones, will often say it got out of control because of environmental changes. Their spouse left them of their relationship ended or their children moved out or their aging parents downsized or died. And as a result they've been presented with even more stuff and it totally overwhelmed their ability and their limited ability to cope with it and to deal. At that point, they now recognize the problem. So, I think there's a bit of an artificiality in our saying it's more prevalent among the elderly, which is simply related to the objective reality, which is that it takes years for the accumulation in many cases to really reach that threshold of intolerance or impairment that's recognized by the individual.\n",
      "Interviewer: That makes total sense. Well I really appreciate your time, I don't want to keep you any longer.\n",
      "Interviewer: So I guess what I'm imagining here is somebody who's space is just really, you know, over cluttered. Like the example you gave where there's rodents, they're being evicted, and they look at their space and they say, \"This looks fine to me, this looks like a normal home\" and I guess I'm wondering is is that because they're in denial about it? Or is that because they truly are looking at something and seeing something different than reality?\n",
      "Interviewee: So I think there is this perceptual problem, the anosognosia, which could also be termed in a milder form as clutter blindness, right? And so I see that all the time in some of my people with hoarding where they really don't see it registering the same way others would and I find photos very useful in that regard, because sometimes they'll take photos and bring them in to show me, and when we look at the photos together they together will say, \"That looks a lot worse than I realized, I see what you're seeing and I hadn't looked at it that way.\" That part of it really fits, and so many overvalued ideations I see all the time, but to call them truly delusional as a psychiatrist, I'm trying to think whether I've seen anybody.\n",
      "Interviewer: I guess part of the reason I'm curious is because I've also been talking to people about animal hoarding, and people who talk about animal hoarding are very comfortable, or some of them are anyway,\n",
      "Interviewee: I'm sorry, yes, yes let me take that back. One case I've seen, who was an animal hoarder who I thought was frankly delusional, you're right. But he didn't have any other feature of hoarding, he actually had severe OCD and some [INAUDIBLE 44:55] issues. But, I did believe he was delusional.\n",
      "Interviewer: It's interesting, so I've been talking to people more and more because in some ways it seems so related to object hoarding, but in other ways it's quite quite different and I think that that's maybe the sense that I'm getting from talking to experts is that they're very hesitant to say that hoarders are truly delusional, but with animal hoarding it appears to be more of a real problem perceiving the reality of the situation. How do you think about the relationship between those two disorders yourself?\n",
      "Interviewee: So, I haven't been presented with a significant number of cases of serious animal hoarding, maybe less than in the fingers of one hand, and I don't know whether that's just related to the setting in which I work and the type of patients that get referred to me.\n",
      "Interviewer: It is an interesting facet of hoarding disorder that someone can have the same neurobiology and have the same thoughts and even the same behaviors but, because of their kind of socioeconomic status, just not have a disorder. It's been difficult for me to think of another disorder like that, where you just won't be diagnosed with it. So, I don't know\n",
      "Interviewee: Actually, well, I'm gonna just put out there, if you think about it for a moment, mild ADHD in people who have moved into creative professions, where they're required and praised for their ingenuity and innovativeness and creativity, I've seen a few individuals throughout the years who have told me that if they didn't have their inattentiveness, that they think it would be more difficult for them to come up with some of those ideas. You know, they're not quite the same, but there's a bit of that. I think people with bipolar disorder, where the manias are mostly cyclic mood disorders where they have hypomanias or have has few manias but long periods of hypomania, who would tell me they don't want to go on mood stabilizers because they work in a creative area, such as writing, and they worry it would impact their ability to come up with their ideas.\n",
      "Interviewer: I mean, I guess that the--\n",
      "Interviewee: A few examples of that, that I don't think are as clear cut as the hoarding one,\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, and I guess the other difficulty with hoarding disorder is that distress criteria. So, this person is not meeting distress criteria, because objectively speaking, his home is not compromised. But many hoarders don't endorse distress because they have such as low insight into their behavior. And so that's sort of the--\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, and then I look at the behavior. I mean, that's where I think, because we have the impairment or inability to maintain safety for yourself or others, it's not perfect, and you're absolutely right, I hadn't given that enough thought when you asked about problems with the criteria, but typically in those situations we'll say there's some concern, they deny that it's a problem. I have a lady like that with OCD and hoarding, she's been evicted 5 times, she generally over the years has denied that her hoarding is a big problem it just angers others around her. But objectively, there would certainly be a fire hazard and a times, she'd have vermin, so, right? I think the criteria aren't bad as an effort to try and get at that and give us enough venue.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, yeah. So, my husband and sometimes like he doesn’t like to have things on the stairs. And so, I’ve got things on the stairs. So, that's kind of a constant source of irritation. And we share a walk-in closet, and I've got like three sides of the walk-in closet. More than half of the walk-in closet. So that’s; it was a source of irritation but now I think it’s just accepted as the way it is. We have things in the attic that I know I’m never gonna use again but they used to a source of\n",
      "22:26 Interviewer:\n",
      "Contention?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "of tension but now it’s just accepted as “they’re there” and we have to look at them. So I know they’re there and that’s good for me, and I don’t know if knowing they’re there is bad for him. So it’s just not a source of conversation anymore.\n",
      "22:45 Interviewer:\n",
      "So just like I'm just like household conflicts but nothing, nothing greater than that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, not for me.\n",
      "22:55 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, so now we'll move on to our second section which is about your space and living area. So, could you please describe where you live now.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I live in a house in suburban neighborhood in [location name].\n",
      "23:14 Interviewer:\n",
      "And what’s the space like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, it’s a 1970s-open plan sort of house. With a front and back yard, side yard and swimming pool.\n",
      "23:27 Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that you have difficulty moving around, or is there like enough space for everything?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, there’s enough space for everything.\n",
      "23:38 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, um. Are you happy with how your house looks inside like are you happy with the amount of space that you have?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, so it's, I think, yes. I would like there to be more space. I would like there to be more space. But I think most people would not think that its particularly cluttered. But, um, I’m sitting in this office room now and there are sewing machines on the floor. There’s shoe boxes on the floor, there’s another box on the floor and a bag of something else that’s not put away on the floor. So, there are those things that could be put away.\n",
      "24:37 Interviewer:\n",
      "How Important are your things to you in order for you to feel like you're at home. So, like, in other words, how, how important are your items to you that they, in a sense, represent home?\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, and you know, this interview isn't an effort to discredit the criteria, it's just kind of an effort to think through them and to understand kind of how clinicians are applying them. It's interesting for that reason, and it's also interesting because you know different people can have different ideas on a normal spectrum of how much is too much. So, some people really like having clutter around, they feel better in a space that's more full of items than others, and we wouldn't think that that's strange, but it crosses a line with hoarding disorder in terms of safety and sometimes not with distress, sometimes with distress. So, I'm wondering again, like the beautiful example you gave of the man with his bespoke suits, would it be possible to have hoarding disorder with, for example, digital media? So, could somebody hoard emails and books online, and PDFs, and have just hard drives full of material and would that be a hoarder?\n",
      "Interviewee: I've had trouble with that one. I mean, people ask about it, I've read about it myself, and I've had clients who do have problems with accumulating a lot of online material, far more than they could ever use, review, even access because it's not, they're not able to organize it appropriately anymore. But, I'm a little hard pressed, because if it were solely the digital media, I've not seen someone where it's solely digital accumulation without physical accumulation of other material. So, in those cases where I've seen the two coexisting, I would say that the electronic acquiring or accumulation is a feature of their hoarding difficulty. I guess I haven't been presented with a person who solely accumulates digitally and who would say their living circumstances physically are fine. I don't know what that would look like and how I would feel comfortable applying the diagnostic criteria, unless they were really distressed by their accumulation or reported spending too much time and effort, for example, on trying to catalog or organize it, I haven't read into that. But I think that if I heard somebody with that kind of description, where they've said, \"I myself am distressed by my electronic accumulation, I spend too much time acquiring electronic materials, I can't organize them to find what I want and it's troubling me and getting in the way because I'm spending so much effort on it,\" that would probably be them somebody I might end up diagnosing as an OCRD not otherwise specified kind of situation. But I've never seen one like that, so I don't know if those really exist.\n",
      "Interviewer: It's kind of along the lines of the collector example, where people may do that, but it's very rarely confined to one sphere like that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: It seems like there were a bunch of different components. So part of it was that the apartment, some part seemed usable and some parts seemed less usable and it was difficult to evaluate how long the situation was gonna stay like that. So maybe that would've been acceptable if her apartment was gonna stay in that condition for a little while, but if that was a permanent state it might be evaluated differently. And then also because her bed wasn't typically arranged the way a typical bed would, it sounds like it also made it more difficult to evaluate like how much there really was in these photographs. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that's right, that's right. And also because we weren't physically in the room, we couldn't...it didn't look like there was a lot in the closets, but I've also seen that in hoarded homes. Like where everything is in the middle of the room and the closets are empty [laughs]. And so yeah I had a really hard time sorting that. Oh and she also said that--she described a hallway in which there was a washer, a dryer, and a desk and we didn't have photos of this part, but she said her landlord had come by to let her boyfriend into the apartment and he'd seen the hallway and he'd said to her, \"This needs to be cleaned up.\" Like apparently it was really overflowing with laundry and things like that and so that made me think oh there's pressure, like obviously that hallway looks quite full. But then she said that the landlord had told her, \"you know, whenever you'd like me to come back, whenever you feel ready for me to come back and have a look that it's cleaned up you just let me know.\" So that means that he didn't think it was urgent, like really freak out, but clearly he thought something was not right in there.\n",
      "Interviewer: So that was kind of your way of imagining what somebody who was outside this home would think of the home, and from that you typed up that it was unusual but maybe not truly alarming.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, exactly, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: And so how did you end up making the decision? What decision did you end up coming to?\n",
      "Interviewee: We ended up, or I ended up deciding that she didn't meet criteria for hoarding because I felt like her home was too functional, but I also didn't put her in the healthy control group because she had too much hoarding for me to feel like she was clearly in either group. So we have a category that we call sub-clinical, where we see if the person's endorsing all the right mental state around their objects. There's just not quite enough impairment, so I put her in that category.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, one of the criteria that clinicians have talked about in different ways is the one that says that the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas, and substantially compromises their intended use. So, I guess the question that this criteria begs for me is different people live in difference spaces, you know, if you are living in a trailer you have very little space and you require very few items to congest and compromise it, whereas if you are extremely wealthy and can afford six storage units and have a huge house, you may never reach the point where your living area is substantially compromised. And I'm wondering how you think about that when you go through the process of using this criteria?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it can be a conundrum and it can cloud and potentially lead to under diagnose of those who are in the wealthier economic strata. But, on the other hand, when I've met individuals like that who have the luxury of lots of space, they're typically also not distressed by the problem because they have enough space that they can still live very well in the space they have. And so, from the perspective of distress or impairment, they won't meet either. So, if I may I can give you one very straight forward example like that, who's an individual I've seen on and off for years for OCD who is from a very wealthy family. He lives alone in a 5 bedroom home, and has essentially a butler to assist him. He buys about 30 bespoke suits a year even though he doesn't have more than a few occasions a year to wear them, and he has accumulated all the old ones, not to mention other types of items of clothing, such that in his five bedroom home, he sleeps in one bedroom, has one room that's a guest room, and the other three are closet space.\n",
      "Interviewer: Wow\n",
      "Interviewee: Right? He is not distressed by it, he objectively recognizes that he accumulates too much, and he would say that he has trouble parting with the old ones and he sees that it's excessive, the acquiring of them, but it doesn't really distress him in any meaningful way, it doesn't impair him. He has the ability to function beautifully in his house and has people over all the time, his butler helps him keep his clothing collection organized, there's no hardship. From a neurobiological perspective, I think he's somebody who in a research study if our criteria didn't exclude him, would probably show the same neurobiological issues but don't think that clinically he's at threshold, because of his material wealth and ability to live comfortably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "The next set of questions I had for you was about your home, but we've talked through a lot of it.\n",
      "It sounds like your home right now is cluttered, but you've managed to clear some spaces in your living room in particular to host guests, but you find yourself spending less time in spaces that are less cluttered.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "At least so far.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I've only just really thought of that while talking to you, because I am feeling pleased with the living room.\n",
      "I'm realizing that I don't spend time there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you like the way it looks, but it doesn't feel homey to you.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Not yet.\n",
      "Not yet.\n",
      "I think it's going to take...\n",
      "They always say it takes a while to establish a new habit, that I'm going to have to go do it for a while.\n",
      "And it's-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you're not used to it.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "No. I'm just not used to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think of the things that you save, what do you think are the most valuable things, like if somebody were to go through your stuff and say, \"Okay.\n",
      "We're going to throw 90% of this out, but you get to pick the stuff that we don't throw out,\" what would be the first set of things that you would go for to make sure it doesn't get discarded?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I don't think I have anything left.\n",
      "When I had to leave Berkeley, I found some lady who did garage sales and sold most of the stuff that I thought was valuable.\n",
      "Then I had collected over the years some really nice semi-precious gemstone necklaces and things like that, and I gave some of those to my niece and gave away some of the others.\n",
      "Then the last...\n",
      "I've only got one thing left, really, that has any dollar value, a necklace that my dad gave me.\n",
      "Just a few months ago, a housekeeper that I'd hired to help me vacuum stole all the rest of my jewelry, so I have almost nothing left.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do your family and your friends treat this behavior?\n",
      "Does it cause conflict or are they understanding about it?\n",
      "How does it impact your relationships?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I think it bothers my wife that I can't be better, cleaner and more efficient.\n",
      "It bothers my children, because they worry that we will never move, because we're victims of inertia.\n",
      "But it does have, it has issues, problems, it creates problems with the people I love, and the need to have it around me when I can't do things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like you're aware of the fact that it bothers them, maybe there isn't a lot of conflict in the sense of people being upset or angry about it actively, but you know that your children are worried about it and that it bothers your wife.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Could you describe for me your house?\n",
      "It sounds like your house is a big part of your personal identity, and I wonder if you could just tell me about it.\n",

      "What does it look like?\n",
      "What do you like about it?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "The house that we rebuilt after the fire has many spaces, and of course, we also added on.\n",
      "My wife became employable with her nursing, and so we've developed a fairly large house that has four bedrooms and three-and-a-half baths.\n",
      "It's just perfect for us, as far as an open floor plan.\n",
      "We like the way it was redesigned by the architect.\n",
      "The grounds, we constantly are putting money, especially with the need to not travel, because we tend to travel quite a bit.\n",
      "We've traveled, bicycled across Europe and across America.\n",
      "So constantly thinking about spending money on travel, that budget has now been devoted to our house.\n",
      "We've worked to make our landscaping much more enjoyable, the patio and stone wall and just the gardens, and just enjoying the nature now.\n",
      "So the house is a great source of pride, but it's also a source of maintenance for it too.\n",
      "There are resources that we have to think about addressing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Makes sense.\n",
      "It sounds lovely.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "It's a wonderful ...\n",
      "Of course, we're in an environment, we're in a fairly rural area of Northern New Jersey, it's well educated and healthy, and is very attractive bicycling.\n",
      "We can go out and bicycle for 60 miles in horse country, and beautiful valley, creek valleys and high up mountains, hills and feel good about having climbed it, and go down.\n",
      "It's a thrill to be able to bicycle and be healthy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "So we've very happy with our lives right now, and our finances are very good with two pensions and Social Security.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you're secure and you sound like you are in a very idyllic location, and your home is exactly the way you and your wife designed it to be and built it to be.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. I just have a couple of last questions about how the current situation with the coronavirus pandemic has affected you.\n",
      "Do you feel like there's been an effect on your saving behavior at all, or has your saving and hoarding behavior changed because of COVID?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I don't know that it's because of COVID so much, but I do think that the stay at home restrictions... I didn't realize.\n",
      "It took me several weeks to really recognize that because I'm very solitary and I tend to be shy, so I have a hard time making friends... I may not sound shy, but in terms of the kinds of behaviors that enable people to get to know each other, I'm not very good at it... I would often go out and go for a drive and buy food I didn't really need, or go to the store and look at such and such a place, and then I'd see a pair of earrings and I'd think I don't really need that, but they're awfully pretty.\n",
      "Because I can't do that now.\n",
      "It's really made me look at why was I doing this?\n",
      "Because I think I'm beginning to recognize that I need people more than I realized I did, and that a lot of those activities were kind of replacements for intimacy that I don't have in my life.\n",
      "Now, what I'm going to do about that, I don't know, but I-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's, I think, a really important realization.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I think a lot of people, a lot of the distress that this could cause for so many other people is because most people that I've observed seem to have quite a few relationships in their lives, so they're really missing them, but I'm not.\n",
      "I don't have a lot.\n",
      "The people that I'm closest to live a long way away, so most of our contact is by phone and email.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It hasn't really affected you socially-\n",

      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Has the threat of scarcity of items been an issue for you, the idea that things might run out?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "No. Not really.\n",
      "I happen to buy my toilet paper in large quantities anyway, so I have a big supply, and I would've been nervous if I'd gotten to the end of that supply and I still couldn't find anything, but I didn't have...\n",
      "I'm not afraid of death, particularly.\n",
      "I'm afraid of pain, but I'm not afraid of death, so I don't have a lot of the anxiety that people have about the implications of all of this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you actually feel like maybe you've been less affected than most people.\n",
      "You haven't been worried about-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I think that-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",

      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think the only thing I've done that's a little bit different is when I do go to the grocery store, I let myself buy a bigger variety of things and occasionally something that I might not normally think I could afford.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I can't [inaudible 00:47:26]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you see so much beauty and potential in items, and you're sure that somebody else out there must be able to see it and find them useful.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Well, I hope so.\n",
      "I'm not so sure.\n",
      "I'm not sure, but I hope.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So you're kind of trying to look for the right person who will appreciate these items the way you do and want them.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There's not enough time.\n",
      "I don't have enough time to do it, and there are times, almost, when I know that the... I live in Santa Rosa, California where there were those huge fires in the fall of '17, and I know lots of people who lost their homes.\n",
      "I know people who lost their homes in the fire in Oakland back in '91, and I hear the same people say almost how ever horrible it was to lose all of their families treasures, but there was this incredible sense of relief that came from not having to decide.\n",
      "I think that's the thing I'm most aware of right now is that all of these things require decisions, and sometimes it gets exhausting the number of decisions.\n",
      "I think people like my sister-in-law, who keep an immaculate home and just throw out everything that doesn't seem important to her, she doesn't have all those decisions to make, but she ends up throwing away important papers sometimes and stuff.\n",
      "There's this trade off.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Any other-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "But I-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Any other reasons you think that people might want to to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "They might have health... I would hope they have health concerns.\n",
      "I'm very worried about my brother's, the condition that his stove and stuff like that, about cockroaches and things eventually getting in, so health concerns would be one.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So maybe wanting to-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "And shame.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Shame?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's a great one.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Shame would be a motive.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So far, in the-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "That would require a recognition that something is wrong.\n",

      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I don't-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And that's hard for people.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So we have wanting to kind of invite people into your home or be more social.\n",

      "Right.\n",

      "Having the money to seek treatment.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",

      "Having health concerns about how you're living and that situation, and feeling ashamed of it and wanting to seek treatment for that reason.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",

      "Are there any other reasons that you want to add before we move on to wanting to seek treatment?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I'm trying to think about if I hadn't started doing this myself what I... I think that pretty much covers the gamut.\n",
      "I don't know that there might be ways that you could break some of those down more, but-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",

      "I like being alone.\n",
      "I think I've really been looking at this level of meaning, like what do these things mean to me?\n",
      "Why do they feel [inaudible 00:57:07] Why do I like having a card of two little girls talking with each other that somebody gave me?\n",
      "Why do I have that in front?\n",
      "There's a whole pile.\n",
      "Why am I looking at that?\n",
      "Why did that seem important enough to put in front?\n",
      "It may seem like a tremendous waste of time, but because I...\n",

      "You've really been-\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "... that makes them appear to be so meaningful to you.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think about your behavior or the behavior of your brother or people who have hoarding problems, how does that behavior differ, in your opinion, from people who save things for \"normal\" reasons, so like people who are collectors?\n",
      "What's the difference?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Well, it seems to me that people who are real, genuine collectors are often thinking about the financial value of things, but even when they're not... I guess I think that most people are able to better evaluate the space they have available versus the things... how full do they want that space to be, and if they don't mind having lots and lots of stuff together, crammed in one place, because they like everything, then that's one thing.\n",
      "I think about my grandmother.\n",
      "When she died, we found she'd collected... I don't know.\n",
      "You're probably too young to remember this, but back in the '50s and before, you would go to a card store, and they wouldn't have all the cards on display.\n",
      "They'd have great big books of sample cards that you could order and pick.\n",
      "Then each season, they'd give away the old books of sample cards.\n",
      "My grandmother would get them, because she was poor, and she would save some of the cards, and she would take some of them out, and she used them as photograph albums.\n",
      "She moved well over 100 times in her life, so she had to deal with that problem a lot of how much can I take with me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And she saved them.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "She kept some things she probably didn't need, but it wasn't outrageous.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",

      "Not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, no. It's okay.\n",
      "I'm interested in this.\n",
      "That's why we're talking about it.\n",
      "It sounds like there's a conflict between what you find comfortable and the aesthetic that you'd like to have your house be in-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Right.\n",

      "I think it does.\n",
      "I think that... I mean, I'm sitting in my bedroom now, and I'm looking around at all the things that I wish were different.\n",
      "Now, I don't know that I'm comfortable, in the sense that I'm comfortable reading in my bed, I'm comfortable working on my computer, but when I look around, there's as part of me that just goes, \"Oh, my god.\n",
      "There's too much stuff.\n",
      "There's too much stuff.\"\n",
      "It's not as strong as it used to be, and I don't think I feel a lot of the shame I used to feel in relation to it, but my bedroom and one small cable in my TV room are really the only places in the house that I spend much time in.\n",
      "Even though I'm liking the living room, I don't spend much time in it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "Is there a reason that you don't-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I think what it is is that even if I like, aesthetically, the less cluttered places, I'm not used to spending time in them, so I'm having to really look at saying how do I... can I, once I get these photographs out of the way, will I be able to actually go in there and use the living room as a place to read or listen to music or listen to the radio, all the things that I do in my bedroom that is very cluttered?\n",
      "I don't know where this would fit in.\n",
      "This might fit better in our later discussion, but one of the things that really turned me around about my collecting stuff was an insight I had 10 or 15 years ago.\n",
      "I don't know why.\n",
      "I was in another place, had way more possessions then, and I suddenly had this vision of a pack rat that are known to go out and collect bright, shiny things and bring them back to their nest, and they kind of build them into the walls of their nest.\n",
      "Nobody really quite knows what they do with them, but they're just fascinated, and they keep collecting and collecting and collecting.\n",
      "I had this vision that this whole bunch of clutter in my house was kind of like a nest that I built around myself that kept... in some way, helped made my world safer, as a nest would make an animal feel when they were in it.\n",
      "I don't know how much of that is still part of me, but understanding that really helped me be able to recognize the irrationality of some of my impulses to keep things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about if you think about-\n",

      "I've learned a lot, because I'm older, and because I went to 12 step meetings for 30 years.\n",

      "Going through my daughter's room, we have a five-drawer cabinet which my wife cleaned out and disposed of all the old papers and got the file cabinet out.\n",
      "So that was a good project, again, you can tell that she is ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Pushing you to ...\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "She is pushing me and making my life better.\n",
      "Honestly, there's another feeling like, while my wife is still here and we're still healthy, we need to use this time to make our lives better and happier.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you see the process of going through your stuff as an activity that you can do with and for your wife to improve your lives together as you age.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "I love it, the organization as a loving activity is really nice.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Because I know it makes her happy, it makes me happy and then her too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think about the things that you save, which do you think are the most important or valuable for you?\n",
      "Which things would you have the hardest time giving up?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I would say the projects that are currently active, which are things like my painting around the house, the gardening tools, the maintenance of the grounds, like my tractor and my lawn mower and the tools I use for dirt moving, wheelbarrow, things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So most important possessions you have are the ones that you use the most.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So would it be fair to say that when you think about all the things you save, the thing that makes them valuable is that they are useful, they are useful and used by you?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you're going through the process of organizing or trying to, for example, you can think about the garage, when you were going through the garage, how did you make decisions about what was trash and needed to be thrown away and what needed to continue to be saved?\n",
      "What was that process like for you?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Obviously, if it had aged into un-usability, meaning rusting or hardening of paint or things like that, that was an easy hit.\n",
      "Going through it also thinking that probably that I'll never ...\n",
      "That project is beyond me now, is another factor in deciding how to do things.\n",
      "One of the important elements for me is to somehow try to regroup the scattered-ness of the elements that I have.\n",
      "In other words, I don't think we've talked too much about the fact that I tend to use something and just drop it.\n",
      "That's a very important element of my character.\n",
      "Once I've solved the problem, I don't clean up after myself.\n",
      "I think that probably should go back in some list.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So it's not simply a matter of you keeping things, it's a matter of, once you're not actively using them, they just stay wherever you last used them.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Right, and I forget where I put that, because I'm moving onto something else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You seem very oriented towards tasks and their completion, and you get a lot of satisfaction out of that, and then once it's not useful to you in the moment anymore, it completely falls off your radar and it's not interesting to you.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "And don't think about completing it to the point where I can find it next time I need it.\n",
      "It's almost like used and then gone the next thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It also seems like that's a component of what you were just talking about, which is this sense of potential projects, or it almost sounds like ambition of, \"One day I'll be able to do this thing, and I'm just going to save these things until I am able to get around to whatever this project is.\"\n",
      "So for you, discarding is also about the process of giving up those sorts of ambitions of one day completing those projects.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "That's true, but I think the point I was trying to make, Interviewer, was that even if something I know is necessary, still part of my active project possibilities, I don't honor the fact that I have disorganized something when using it.\n",
      "It needs to be then reestablished for the next time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So again, I'm going to try to repeat that back to you, because I want to understand.\n",
      "So it sounds like what you're saying is you're so oriented towards usefulness, but sometimes you undermine objects' usefulness by not organizing them and keeping them in a way that will make them optimally useful for you.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "In the future, yeah.\n",
      "It's almost a sense of, I've completed what I was trying to get done, but I don't realize that's not the end of the project.\n",
      "The end of the project is using, thinking about the tools, thinking of how I've broken up my organization to get this project done, it needs to be then reestablished so that it can be available in the future.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That part of the process is just really difficult for you to notice.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Maybe because I'm prone to take on too many things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "For sure.\n",
      "Have you ever met anyone-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I mean, some of the stuff-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Some of it...\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "No. Have I ever met anyone what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I was going to ask if you had ever met anyone and suspected that they had hoarding without knowing, based on looking at their space or watching them?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "There's-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever met someone and been like I wonder-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There's...\n",
      "Or like if they're borderline.\n",
      "I know a couple of people, like my brother, who just going to their house kind of makes my skin crawl.\n",
      "There's one friend who lives in the same housing complex as my brother, and he can at least clear a seat for me to sit down if he knows I'm coming, but that's the only space in the whole space that doesn't make my skin crawl.\n",
      "But I can see that there might be in between...\n",
      "Now, you know what, I'm wondering...\n",
      "I'm not sure that there would be really good signs that you could tell, because I know so many people who have beautiful homes with beautiful possessions, and maybe more than they need, but nothing that seems completely out of the way.\n",
      "I can really tell the people whose homes are very bare, which is not the same as barren, where they picked pieces that go together nicely but not a lot of them, or something like that.\n",
      "I think I would have trouble with somebody who was sort of in between.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For the last list I'd like to make with you, I'd like you to list for me all of the reasons that you think someone might want to seek treatment for hoarding problems.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Well, the first one that would come to my mind for myself is wanting to be able to overcome a lot of shyness and at least have a place where I might feel okay inviting somebody into the house.\n",
      "I don't know what you'd call that.\n",
      "Social anxiety?\n",
      "A recognition that I'm keeping people away?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wanting to invite people into your home, maybe.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I lost the chance once to have a friend as a roommate.\n",
      "She was looking for housing when I needed a roommate, and she just had to tell me very bluntly, \"I couldn't live somebody like you,\" and that was painful.\n",
      "I mean, I really respected her telling me, but it was painful.\n",
      "It would be wanting to be able to keep connections or make connections closer.\n",
      "Seek treatment.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I think...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "The main reason for you that you would want to-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:28:10]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It would be having the money to do it or the resources to do it would be part of it, because there isn't much, except for Hoarders Anonymous or Debtors Anonymous, that I know of where somebody could get help at very low cost or minimal cost.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So people might want to seek treatment if they're able to afford it.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "A lot more liable.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "We're around people that are intelligent and caring, and can associate with them in our churches.\n",
      "My church is very thoughtful and I have a chance to get educated in many ways, going to New York City, when it opens up again, but still now, I just got used to Zoom.\n",
      "I have several Zoom conferences, I talk to people in Britain on Zoom.\n",
      "My life is very varied, I'm very happy about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "When you think about your house, how does your stuff fit into your house?\n",
      "So if you could paint me a picture of your house, not just of the house itself, but as the house with your belongings, what is that like?\n",
      "How does all of your saving fit into the space?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Okay, so the garage is my little area where I keep all my tools and all the different project history that I have, with the auto mechanics and gardening and bicycling and all the cleaning of bicycles, the storage of supplies, paints.\n",
      "I painted my own house, by the way.\n",
      "Then the basement also, the steps going to the basement is a place for a lot of things, but things are stored on the shelves and things like that in disorganized ways.\n",
      "Boxes that I will think that I may need if I have to send something back that I have for a repair.\n",
      "Those are my storage areas.\n",
      "Our bedrooms, we recently, my wife encouraged me to go through and throw out clothes that no longer fit, and I've done that so our spaces for our storage of our clothes are very useful right now.\n",
      "Our bedroom is good, I keep the clutter of the various types of clothing stored well and under control.\n",
      "My bathroom, I clean regularly, so it's nice most of the time.\n",
      "Our bedrooms are beautiful, and with windows to look out around the woods around us.\n",
      "We recently restored our daughter's room, the daughter who has the bipolarity has moved out of state, but she left a mess room, so we recently just cleaned that up and repainted it.\n",
      "Very satisfying there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's interesting, because you talk about your stuff and the clutter, but also it's so clear to me that you take such pride in the space and the maintenance of the space.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there areas, it sounds like your garage used to be cluttered and the clutter is creepy back.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yes, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But you have really taken care with repainting it and organizing.\n",
      "Are there places that you consider cluttered in your house?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yeah, the garage is coming back, because it's still a controlled mess.\n",
      "It could use a lot of improvement, figuring out how to dispose of old paint cans, of old paint, of the old auto mechanic tools, the bicycle gear.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I think one of the major parts of my life was that our house burned down, and I became a general contractor in rebuilding that house at the age of about 35 I think.\n",
      "'81, I'm 46, 35, yeah.\n",
      "So I recognized that I didn't have enough money to build the house with a contractor, so I decided to marshal my friends and myself, so I really delved into how to save resources and do things yourself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it was a defining moment for you to lose all of your possessions, what was that like for you as somebody who is a saver?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "It did not bother me.\n",
      "I said, \"The past is past and I've now got a new project.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you took on rebuilding the house yourself as a major part of your life.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yeah, right.\n",
      "For about a year.\n",
      "But that was psychologically a very important moment in my development.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So how did that contribute to the changes in your saving behavior?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "It opened up other realms of areas that I needed to save for.\n",
      "I found new tools that were necessary.\n",
      "Another part of my life was that at one point I was a mechanic in autos, so the tools that you repair autos are part of my realm.\n",
      "So I have dabbled in many mechanical things, so that's contributed to the saving element.\n",
      "Just being willing to take on so many projects.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So you started to save tools and things related to those jobs, to help you to be able to rebuild your home and to help you to do projects like that in the future.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "And in a resourceful way, by not having other people coming and do it, but do it myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is it like for you now?\n",
      "How would you say that your saving behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "It's a challenge, because I've gotten to the age of 74 where I can no longer want to do those things, but I find that I haven't used the energy to just go through them and say, \"Okay, I'll never use that, it's useless.\"\n",
      "As an example, I have some tools that my father passed down to me, and so I have trouble a little bit in deciding which of those things might be interesting to keep, just because of the memories I have from him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So some of the things you keep are related to usefulness, but also you keep things because they have sentimental value.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then as you settled down, what happened, when you found that you weren't moving quite so much?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "For a long time, I had to rent rooms, but it was longer periods.\n",
      "I just had no room.\n",
      "It got really bad when I had an opportunity after my mother died, because I inherited a little bit of money, to be able to buy a small house.\n",
      "All of a sudden, I had three times the amount of room that I've ever had, and I did need a roommate, but even with that, I still had a lot of room.\n",
      "I don't think I even ever really thought about it, except that it gradually got so that there was hardly room for me to walk to my living room.\n",
      "There were piles of papers and books.\n",
      "I don't mind piles of books.\n",
      "Those just look interesting.\n",
      "But piles of paper.\n",
      "Piles of all sorts of stuff lying around.\n",
      "I remember once I had one roommate who was dearly loved, and I was trying to think of something to eat, because I'm not much of a cook, and I said, \"I don't know what to eat.\"\n",
      "And she opened my cupboard doors, and she said, \"You know, I could eat for a year on what you have there.\"\n",
      "And it just blew me away.\n",
      "Still blows me away thinking about it.\n",
      "It had something to do with not being able to say, \"How can I use what I have?\" as opposed to saying, \"My impulse right now doesn't find anything I have appealing, so I want to go get something different.\"\n",
      "I don't know what you'd call that, but I recognize that as being very powerful in me now.\n",
      "This stay at home as really gotten me being able to use some stuff up and look at how much I have, and starting to really try to clear out cupboards and things, which has really been wonderful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Now, compared to how it was in the house that you owned...\n",
      "Or do you still own the house?\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "No, I had to sell that.\n",
      "Then I lived for a while at a couple of small apartments in a different town, and now I'm in a largish mobile home that, in terms of square footage, it's probably actually bigger than the house I'd had.\n",
      "Again, I have to share.\n",
      "I've got too much furniture.\n",
      "That I'm very clear.\n",
      "What I can't figure out what to do is how to replace what I have with less.\n",
      "I've been going through.\n",
      "I have a whole bunch of those multi-drawered plastic cabinets that you get from office supply stores and stuff, and I've been going through those and gradually throwing out the things I know I'll never use and trying to consolidate.\n",
      "I've now got a lot of empty drawers, but I can't figure out how to take the next step to consolidate two of those things into one or something like that.\n",
      "Because one of them is supporting a Participant that I don't have any place for.\n",
      "One of them is supporting the place where I store papers I need to be able to access quickly.\n",
      "This is where my lack of organizational... I mean, I know my sister-in-law would come here and she would just say, \"Oh, do this here.\n",
      "Do that there.\n",
      "Throw that out.\"\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "It's a very different approach to things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "I totally understand.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "And my-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that it's better now, your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes, I do think it's better.\n",
      "I mean, if nothing else, I'm not buying something because there's part of me that's saying, oh, I have a place to put it now, because I have a couple of empty drawers.\n",
      "Now more, I'm thinking of how can I consolidate what I have, and in the process, figure out what's a duplicate, what do I really not need?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What does hoarding disorder look like?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I think it's more of a continuum, in the same way that I've come to understand autism is.\n",
      "I think my brother, William, is very far along the continuum.\n",
      "I don't know what end of the continuums would be, whether it would be the kind of person who lives in a house full of stacks of newspapers.\n",
      "I had a friend, Fred, who, when he died, his kids found that he had hoarded tons and tons of food in a closet that rats and things had gotten into.\n",
      "That's what I call the extreme end of it.\n",
      "The other end is somebody like my sister-in-law who doesn't like having anything extraneous.\n",
      "I think I probably fall a little bit past the middle towards the end of hoarder, but I think if 101 is 1 and 50 is the middle, I'm probably somewhere between 60 and 75.\n",
      "I've gotten a lot better.\n",
      "I think I was a lot worse a few years ago.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you have any sources of information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Have you ever read or seen anything about it?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I don't... I get lots of internet resource.\n",
      "I've watched a few episodes of those programs on TV about it, and I didn't find those very helpful, primarily because all those people were getting tons of help, and I've had to do most of this stuff myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "But I have done a lot of reading about it, and I've certainly, in all the years since I had to recognize that I was an alcohol and then began to realize that I belong to Al Anon and ACA and CoDA and Debtors Anonymous and every other 12-step program, practically, I began realizing that addiction is kind of addiction.\n",
      "Those components of things you can get help for, in the sense of comfort, but you need to make the inner decisions yourself about do you really want to do something about it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "So you-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "One of the things I've really been noticing during this stay at home, too, is that something in me really has changed in the last couple of years, because when I look at all the things that I have around me... I have a yard and stuff like that... when I first came here, I couldn't have faced getting rid of a lot of them.\n",
      "Now, I really can.\n",
      "Now, I don't know that I have the physical energy to do everything I'd like to do, but I could face it emotionally, I think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I don't know what's made the difference.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's amazing.\n",
      "I mean, it sounds like it's been a lot of hard work, to reflect back.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "[inaudible 01:02:57] That's for sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Could you walk me through that process of deciding between things?\n",
      "What is that like for you?\n",
      "How do you make those kind of decisions?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Make what kind of decisions?\n",
      "What was the question?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Decisions about which things are valuable and which things can be thrown away.\n",
      "If you were to go through the process with the things in your house or the things in a particular box in your house, for instance, and you were to go through them, how do you decide if something is ready to be discarded?\n",
      "How do you decide if it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "If I was having to imagine to move into one room, the clear criteria would be would I have room for it and would I ever be likely to want to look at it or read it or something again?\n",
      "But if I'm just trying to think about getting rid of things now but staying here, I've actually gone quite a ways along the line of doing that, except for books and art.\n",
      "I went through all my clothes about a year or so ago and got rid of the ones that I didn't like really, but now I'm left with a closet that still has three times as many clothes as I need, because I like every single piece.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I figure as long as I have the room, I'm not going to be too hard on myself about that, but if I had to really downsize, I think I would be able to pick the clothes I'd be comfortable in.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "It's a very interesting question, and I think that's partly the question I've been asking myself.\n",
      "I had heart surgery back in March of '17, and I had to deal with a lot of issues that I didn't expect to have to deal with.\n",

      "What does hoarding disorder look like and how is it the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I think that I have clutter disorder, I don't think I have hoarding.\n",
      "In other words, hoarding, I think of it being in love with things and acquiring, just wanting to get more of the same thing.\n",
      "Shopping, wanting to spend more and more.\n",
      "Almost blindly not being able to stop a collection, compulsiveness.\n",
      "I don't identify as being compulsive, or that compulsive.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like there's a couple of elements, one is this wanting things for the sake of owning things, and that's not really how you operate at all.\n",
      "It sounds like you save things for a totally different reason that's not even related to the things themselves.\n",
      "From our earlier conversation, it even sounds like it comes from a place of wanting to use less, because you're trying to reuse, so that's part of it.\n",
      "Then there's also this extreme compulsive behavior that you don't see in yourself, like the need for things.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Let me make a point to you that I know of people who, in my life that I've come upon, who have hoarding and shopping.\n",
      "My daughter just couldn't stop her shopping, and she ran up tens-of-thousands of dollars in debt in credit cards, ruined her credit rating, because she just couldn't stop acquiring more things.\n",
      "I don't have that.\n",
      "My brother's ex-wife had a shopping disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you really don't have the acquiring component of hoarding at all, you don't go out and get stuff or over-buy.\n",
      "The way that you feel connected to the term hoarding disorder is by saving, and even then, it sounds like the kind of saving and the compulsive nature of it really doesn't fit with how you see yourself.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I think there is compulsion, and that is to save.\n",
      "Saving is a compulsion.\n",
      "It's not realistic to save all these things, and it's not realistic to not go through these things and reevaluate and based on current circumstances, what has changed and what needs to be cleaned up.\n",

      "I could get books for 10 cents apiece.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "And even when I was only having $150 a month on top of rent, I could get 10 books for a dollar, where that was a small enough component of my income that it was possible.\n",
      "Then I think when I started earning money and I had trouble with relationships, I had to, again, cope with the fact that I didn't seem to attract much interest from men or the men that I liked.\n",
      "Then I started buying things, because they gave me comfort in some way.\n",

      "And the thing about both of my parents, both sides, is that they were not the kind of people that would go out to Macy's and buy a bedroom set.\n",

      "Why?\n",
      "Why has it had that effect?\n",

      "If we're asking people to think about their clutter problems as an issue that they should take up with their doctor, how is their doctor thinking about it and how are they thinking about it, and can we maybe use this research to help to understand how to bring those two groups of people together?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Interesting, okay.\n",
      "It might improve the therapy involved.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "But we understand that we're not interviewing exclusively people who have hoarding disorder, the behaviors fall in a spectrum.\n",
      "So I just want to start off the conversation, as long as you're okay to get started, with asking you how you would describe your own place on that kind of spectrum of clutter problems and hoarding disorder.\n",
      "How do you consider that for yourself?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I regard myself as a longtime person who saves, and who is very, quite varied in my interest, my do-it-yourself interest.\n",
      "My hoarding is generally in the area of things that I do to fix the house.\n",
      "I built, I was part of building this house, so I'm involved in everything from plumbing to electricity to painting, every part of the house, I get involved, fixing up.\n",
      "Another area of my problem is papers.\n",
      "I have a concept, and I have for a long time, a concept that there are elements of value in information that I forget, that I may want to come back to, to refresh myself.\n",
      "As such, my inbox and my email is quite voluminous.\n",
      "I use it to go back and refresh myself on some piece of information that I had forgotten.\n",
      "So saving is in my nature.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So we'll talk about you as a saver.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yeah. Well, it's funny.\n",
      "The brother I have, who's a much worse hoarder, he got very ill last year and was actually hospitalized for a while, and they were telling us that he couldn't go back home unless the emergency people could get into his home with a stretcher.\n",
      "It was very clear to the whole family that he couldn't, so we'd all been worried about him for years, so we moved everything that he had, except the basic furniture, into a storage, and he had been giving lip service to saying, \"I want to get rid of stuff, too,\" but as soon as he got home, he took it all back in.\n",
      "It made me realize how deeply that impulse goes, because he knows very well that nobody wants to come visit him with his house the way it is.\n",
      "I don't know that he's been able to let himself consciously see that he uses it as a way to keep people away, I think.\n",
      "It may be the fear or other components are a bigger part of it.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "But anyway, it really taught me something watching, because we made his place be really nice and really welcoming, and just, boom, he had it back.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It made you realize, it sounds like, how much he can't help it-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... and how much he's unaware.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "And absolutely how out of control it is for him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Also, sounds like-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:23:40] too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "But also, I don't want to do that.\n",
      "I don't want to leave my family to be having to clear up after me when I go.\n",
      "I mean, I'm in my 70s.\n",
      "I don't want to leave that burden to them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it made you more self-reflective about-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... about how you want to kind of get control over this, even though it's difficult to control.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I can understand that.\n",
      "It also sounds like it made you realize how little he's able to see why he's doing it.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That kind of made you feel more... kind of value your own self-reflection more.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think it did.\n",
      "It did.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, I don't want to... I want to continue this conversation.\n",
      "I have more questions, but first-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... let's finish our lists.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Before we got distracted by this, we were making a list of ways that a person could identify someone with hoarding, and we talked about how you would look at their space and be able to tell.\n",
      "Do you feel like there's other ways that you could identify someone with hoarding if you met them?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Maybe not just at first meeting, but I've seen my brother look through scrap piles and pick up something, a piece of an old telephone or something like that.\n",
      "So it's-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So if you watched them...\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "If you watch somebody dealing with giveaways or trash or flea markets, where I'm sure you get a lot of that in people who go to flea markets.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what is the saving like in your home right now?\n",
      "Would you say that it's severe, would you say it's under control?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I'd say it's certainly not under control.\n",
      "I feel like right now, I've uncovered a bunch of things that I want to start on after we have this call done.\n",
      "I just feel like there are so many parts of my house that could, that demand some attention to make decisions and throw out.\n",
      "So I think that at this point, it's become, with age and the fact that I have to decide what the next step will be in my life, in order to not leave a mess for my children to clean up when I have ignored the warning signs that you need to organize what you have.\n",
      "So I'm getting a little bit more alarmed and bothered by this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's becoming more and more of a problem for you because with age, you see that you're going to need to organize things.\n",
      "You mentioned the idea of selling your house, is that something that you're considering or that would be on the table for you?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "It's not coming up right away, because we have too many things that we enjoy about where we are right now.\n",
      "But we know, I'm speaking of my wife and I, we know that we need to develop a plan for enjoying the next step, without the maintenance of a house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "So while neither of those things are immediate problems for you, you recognize that the behavior will be a problem in the future if you don't deal with it now.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "And the value of the house will be enhanced if people come and see that things are, the people who lived here who are organized.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever made an effort at any point in your life to change this behavior or to either get professional help for it, or to even just try to change it on your own or with the help of friends and family?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yeah, sure.\n",
      "My kids will come and say, \"Dad, let's go through this.\"\n",
      "My wife will be supportive and say, \"Participant 019, if you do this, I will help you with that.\"\n",
      "And I recently went through my garage and took things apart and repainted everything twice and organized it.\n",
      "But of course, the creeping, the little sections that you don't get done begin to crowd in again.\n",
      "I have been slow that I'm discovering my organization, that I have to just work on, keep it under control.\n",
      "It's time, that stuff is getting ...\n",
      "The danger signs, it looks like a rat's nest.\n",
      "Time to decide what is a never-to-be-used dream and what could be useful in the future.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "People tend to have a cognitive bias towards three, that's interesting.\n",
      "Let's move into just talking a little bit more naturally about your situation and what's been going on with you around your saving behavior.\n",
      "So if you could just start by talking me through your saving, what it's like, how long it's been going on, when it started and then how it developed over time.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I have tried to touch a little bit so far, but I'd say that my perception is that my saving has been a longtime characteristic, probably started with the sense that scarcity or wastefulness is a sin.\n",
      "As a Boy Scout, I definitely felt like there were values of using things and figuring out to how to use things was a skill to be cultivated.\n",
      "I also would tend to think if I had an opportunity to get something, like make a collection of records, I would, early on in my adulthood, I would make that collection, but not get to it, but say, \"I'll get to it someday, because I know this is a valuable and a wonderful resource.\"\n",
      "Classical music of many varieties, and I worked at a record company where I could collect records easily for later use.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it started when you were a kid with these values of resourcefulness and saving and not being wasteful, and then as you got older, you started to develop collections of different kinds of things, but the collections would never be ...\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Right, and the element of religion I think was part of this too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, can you talk about that and what you mean by it?\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Like I said, it was a sin to be wasteful.\n",
      "Sin in the sense that God wants you to use what is here responsibly.\n",
      "That's a value that has continued through my life, I'm constantly thinking of the best way to use the resources of our world and reuse the resources of our world in a responsible way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it really sounds like there's a moral component to you, that it's a moral obligation to responsibly use things and not waste them.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "I think so, yeah.\n",
      "In fact, one of my great phrases is, \"Live simply that others may simply live.\"\n",
      "I constantly resonate to that as I repeat it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So even though it may seem that you have a lot of stuff, for you, what you're doing is actually being respectful of things, because you're not just discarding them as if they were worthless.\n",
      "Instead, you're willing to hang onto them because you see the value in saving things and reusing them and being conscientious about them.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sorry I interrupted your narrative, you were telling me about the record store and how it had changed throughout your life, and I interrupted you.\n",
      "Participant 019:\n",
      "But I did make a collection of records and saved it in hopes that someday I would come to appreciate it and to have it release its value and enjoyment in my life, but without really being very realistic about it, because there's not enough time to do all the things I need to do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you kind of saw in yourself that same impulse, not just to do the kind of...\n",
      "Just to take a step back, it sounds like there's almost two things that you recognize happening.\n",
      "One is this kind of more conscious process of you saying, \"Oh, I could use it.\n",
      "I want to keep it.\n",
      "It's interesting,\" and then it also sounds like you're recognizing or you recognized in that moment maybe a more unconscious process-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... which is about kind of creating a space that feels safe to you out of your items.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Then the other thing that helped was that I'm a recovering alcoholic, and I've been sober for a very long time.\n",
      "I've done a lot of other programs, one of which I went to... it's called Bettors Anonymous... and they had a spinoff over the years of something called Hoarders Anonymous.\n",
      "That was one of the subjects that people dealt with was why do you buy things?\n",
      "Why do you spend money you don't have?\n",
      "What is the impulse?\n",
      "I had finally concluded, and I imagine there are other writers who have, too, that the combination of the advertising we're exposed to and things like that, the tons... the huge availability of choices that we have that people didn't used to have, that there's this constant sense inside that I'll be a better person, a prettier person, a more interesting person, something like that, if I have these things.\n",
      "That's as much of an addiction as anything else, I think.\n",
      "It was the recognition of that addictive quality to my wanting things that I thought were absolutely gorgeous but that I'd never be able to use that finally put the brake on my buying things that were more than I could really afford.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "And I think-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The addictive quality of it was really important.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you used to do more purchasing behavior before you had the realization that-\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... and I'm going to try to say this realization back to you... that you were purchasing because you felt that there were qualities of the things that you were purchasing which would kind of make you more... you would be more associated with their attractiveness.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "I think it was more that I was drawn to the aesthetics of it, and what I wasn't aware of at that time was the psychological impact of advertising and stuff like that on people.\n",
      "It's not just me.\n",
      "I think an awful lot of people buy way more than they need to buy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 020:\n",
      "But other people are more able to get rid of things when they get something new.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Right. But to me that started out as collectors like slide pinball machines and someone, and now it's gone like scary. Like I don't know, and it scares me to think it disintegrates into that. Like could I do that eventually?\n",
      "24:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "okay so I was gonna ask you, like how do you feel about that show?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s sad and it's scary because it didn't seem to unless this I think there’s two of them. I think there’s hoarders and there hoarding. I think there's two different ones, but to me it initially was kind of neat because it started out as collectors then it seemed to disintegrate and I thought that they start out like that. I mean, Like to me what seems to start it. It's like you don't start cleaning up after your pet. And then they get another pet and then you don't clean your toilet. You know what I mean? Like do they start out like me then become like that? It's kind of scary.\n",
      "25:30 Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it scares you because it shows you like what potentially you could turn into maybe?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, I don't think so. But I don't know. Cuz I don’t think the worst. they all seemed to have started out pretty [unclear].\n",
      "25:47 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So other than that hoarding TV show. Is there any other source of information on that you got your information from?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, not really.\n",
      "26:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and then now we'll just move into our next section, which is about distress or interference. So, does your hoarding disorder; do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably no\n",
      "26:21 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, but does it upset you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, Yeah I don't like looking around here. Yeah.\n",
      "26:31 Interviewer:\n",
      "And does it just…Why does it upset you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because I think eventually this has to be cleaned\n",
      "26:44My brother was left to cleaning up what was hoarded at their house. And I mean and plus my grandfather lived there. I mean, [unclear] To be at work. All right. I just found four anchors. And he was a draftsman, and then an uncle had moved in there and is… I mean we're talking dumpster after dumpster after dumpster. We're not talking like we're talking like rented five or six dumpsters.\n",
      "27:12 Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's just like that that like foreshadowing of having to clean all that up.\n",
      "27:20- Right, and that's why I rarely will bring anything in the basement is actually all his now where he had to end up cleaning. Mason jars just full of pickled items.\n",
      "27:33 Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh no you can’t imagine what was in that house.\n",
      "27:37 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and can you describe a time when you're recording disorder got in the way of something you really want it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Moving them from one place to another, from where I knew where everything was to temporarily I might not know where everything was until I had the opportunity to put it back where it belonged. And when I say where it belonged, to where I was accustomed to having it, and um, again, someone would come visit, the boxes would be missing, and then they would go away and the boxes would be moved back to where they needed to be.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:38): So, is it important to you that your stuff kinda stays how you organized it, like in the room? So, you said that you would put things back after the person would leave?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It is my preference that I know where my stuff is.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:54): Right. So, that’s kind of how you like to organize, so that you can, you know, easily remember and recall where things are?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, if someone says hmm, if we’re in a casual conversation and they say I believe I need a [inaudible] and I say, ooh, I have one of those. I know exactly where it is, give me a moment and I will get it. Yes, that is important to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:22): Okay, so, utility and being able to find things really quickly. Alright. Okay, so, do you think it ever gets in the way of your daily life, or at any point in your life did it necessarily get in the way of your daily life to have stuff, or to have clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:42): Okay, and would anyone, like your significant other or you said you had a son, would they ever disagree with you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I don’t think my son had any issues with things, but I’d say my significant other would disagree with me. But I claim that’s because she’s on the other end of the spectrum and she’s an OCD cleaner.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:13): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, if she came to your house, and I’m assuming you’re not someone with hoarding tendencies, she would probably feel that you’re a hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:22): Right. Understandable, yeah. So, for you then it’s never really gotten in the way of what you’ve really wanted? So, for you it’s never really had like a serious impact on your life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:35): Okay, so, also, I wanted to go back a little bit and talk about when you were younger. Did your tendencies look different? I mean, I’m assuming you maybe lived in a different space so maybe at different points in your life um, it kinda took different forms? Like I’m assuming you didn’t always have this particular garage or your office to keep things in. So, earlier in your life what did that maybe look like for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, less space, less stuff.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well again, I’m on the slow road to decumulating rather than accumulating. I’m trying not to gather stuff that I don’t need at this point in time. And I am, um, I, I, expect that through garage sales and charitable donations and Craigslist and things that I think might help more of financial value. I am in the process of slowly getting rid of stuff, although it’s not nearly fast enough for the significant other.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:20): Right. Okay so, theoretically, if you woke up tomorrow and all of your things had suddenly vanished, I mean you still had all the things you needed to get by, but perhaps your significant other would say are unnecessary are suddenly gone, how would you feel about that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would be sad, but I would carry on.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:44): Right, okay so it wouldn’t impact you too drastically.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would be very sad, but then I would carry on.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:55): Okay, understandable. Okay so, the last little bit here—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I mean, people’s houses burn down. What do you do? You lose everything, you start over. So, I’d need a bigger house and I’d accumulate more stuff!\n",
      "Interviewer (46:07): [Laughing] Right. So, the last little bit here is just some demographic questions. Again, I wanna remind you, you don’t have to answer them if you don’t want to, but it definitely would help in gathering data for this study. So, the first question for you is what’s your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "A professional degree.\n",
      "Interviewer (46:35): Okay, so, a bachelor’s degree?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Beyond that.\n",
      "Interviewer (46:39): Beyond that? Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "A doctoral degree.\n",
      "Interviewer (46:43): Okay, awesome. So, I’m gonna list a few ranges for household incomes and if you can, just pick one that applies to your household. Okay, so it goes less than $10,000, $10,000 to $20,000, $20,000 to $35,000, $35,000 to $50,000, $50,000 to $100,000, $100,000 to $150,000, or more than $150,000?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would say for current household income, you can stick it in the fifty to one hundred range.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:18): Okay. So, in the US, which geographic region do you live in?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That would be the Southeast.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:28): Okay. And, what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "They made me a male.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:35): Okay. And, what gender do you identify as now?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m still a male.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:43): Okay, perfect. And, what do you identify as racially?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m [inaudible; (47:48)] Caucasian and I would be still Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:51): Okay. So, you wouldn’t describe yourself as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I am not Hispanic.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:56): Okay. So, that about wraps up all my questions. And, the last thing I wanna mention to you is you are entitled to a thirty-dollar Amazon gift card for doing this interview. And um, would you prefer that be electronic or a physical gift card mailed to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "If you could email that to me, to the email that you presumably have on record, that would be fine.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:21): Okay, so, I’ll jot that down. And, that should come within, um, you know a couple weeks or a couple days. But again, there may be some delays because of COIVD-19.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:36): So, if you have any more questions for me, uh, feel free to ask. But other than that, those are all I have for you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okie dokie.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:46): Okay, well thank you so much and I hope you have a great day.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You too. Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer (48:52): Mhmm, bye now.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Buh-bye.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… that would be… if there was anything that didn’t go to the right home, but there isn’t anything that I would be launched into a terrible depression if it disappeared.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:06): Right. So, it kinda sounds like to you, it’s more important that the thing be put to good use or that it ends up in the right home, like you said, rather than just, you know, having it around for no reason. So, parting with things isn’t really a problem as long as they end up somewhere where they belong?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Somewhere where they are um, appreciated, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:33): Okay. Could you think of an example for me about a time where you had an idea of something, where it should go, and if it did end up there or if it didn’t.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… I probably had some old pet supplies, you know like, uh, uh, uh, and aquarium and things like that, that um, found its way to um, I believe in that particular case, someone that was wanting to start a terrarium. So hey, okay, then I’m down one aquarium. That’s fine, cause it’s, it’s going to a family member that wanted to start a terrarium. One last piece of stuff accumulated in the house.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:21): Okay. So um, do you enjoy getting rid of the things in your collections? Like does it give you—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "If they go to a good use, yes!\n",
      "Interviewer (24:30): Okay. So, ideally you would like to have less stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would be quite content to have much less stuff if the stuff was well used.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:39): Okay. So, in your opinion do you think that you have too much stuff, and if you do, how would you know that you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have too much stuff. I know that I have too much stuff because I keep getting told this is stuff that I need to push out of the way and get somewhere else than the house. Um… my volume of stuff has exceeded the ability for it to all live on shelves in neat order. So, there are piles and boxes on floors that would um, uh, be an indicator perhaps that there’s more stuff than I have space for.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:29): Right. So, really it comes mostly from other people telling you that you have too much stuff and also, you know that the perception that it can’t all fit on like a shelf or look, you know, particularly organized?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That would be fair.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:48): Okay. So, if you have to choose between your items, I know we talked a lot on assigning things values if someone could potentially use them or if they’re sellable, but if you were debating between keeping a couple items, how would you know which one to choose?\n",
      "Interviewer (41:58): Alright, and it's never impeded your ability to do work?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, no.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:04): Gotcha. Okay, so, just a couple more questions here, and then we're going to get to like more of a like demographics type question, and then we'll be done. So, just to wrap it up, um, in terms of your behavior, if you want to change it, why is, why would you want to change it? What's your main motivation for changing your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "For being able to use rooms, for safety. There’s something that needs to be done.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:40): Right. So, when you say for safety, what do you mean by that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You cannot walk into a room. When you’re not able to use a room. But, then you’;’ end up trying to get into a room not knowing what you’re stepping on, and you can easily fall.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:13): So, has that every happened? Has anyone ever like stepped on something or had like a fall due to the clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I have.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:21): Okay. Will you tell me about that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, there’s so much stuff in the room, and you don’t know what you’re stepping on. And, I don’t fall on the floor. I wasn’t seriously hurt or anything like that. Trying to, you know, see what was in a room/\n",
      "Interviewer (43:49): Right. Okay, so you've definitely, you know, experienced some harm as a result of the clutter. Anybody else in your household?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not that I can think of.\n",
      "Interviewer (44:02): Okay. Alright. And, so then, just one last question before we get into the demographics. You know, in, in the scenario in which, you know, you were to wake up one day and all of the possessions you'd been hoarding were suddenly gone, would you be upset?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, because I wouldn’t get to go through it. Something could have been thrown away, something important that I would need.\n",
      "Interviewer (44:27): Right. So, would there be any sort of relief that you would feel?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (44:36): No relief at all, only upset?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, because I feel like I need to do this myself. It’s something I have to do.\n",
      "Interviewer (44:42): Gotcha. So, it sounds to me then like, you don't really let anybody help you when you're, you know, looking through stuff trying to figure out what to get rid of?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, because nobody else is going to know my story of things. Because it’s not gonna be their memories.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:00): Right. So, oftentimes do you go with your gut when it comes to determining what to keep?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:06): Gotcha. Alright, so, in that case, I'm going to move on to just some simple demographic questions and then we will wrap it up. Does that sound good?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:18): Okay, so, the first question is what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:20): Okay. Right, so, let's talk a little bit now about the space that you're living in. I know you said you're staying with your mother, but has that been a long-term arrangement or did you have a house of your own previously?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I have a house of my own. My mother ended up having major surgery, so she was in the hospital and from there went to rehab. And, when I brought her home— she has dementia— so, uh, before she was able to go by herself, but with the anesthesia when you have dementia, it makes the dementia worse. So, at this point, she is not able to stay by herself, and, uh… While she was in rehab, I was walking down to her house anyway. So, I'm just kind of waiting for her to kind of get back to where she can stay alone again.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:28): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m hoping, you know…\n",
      "Interviewer (16:33): Mhmm. So, in the house that you lived in previously, what are the rooms like? Was there any areas of the house that were cluttered in particular?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Most. Uh… there’s a den downstairs. It’s pretty horrible. Uh, the garage is horrible. Uh, we had to get an out-building— well two out-buildings— and they’re packed.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:07):\n",
      "So, what do you mean by horrible?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "There's so much stuff, uh… that I need to figure out. Uh, things on top of boxes, on top of… Just lots and lots of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:28): Mhmm. So, kind of stacked up in like piles, or are they more organized?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Stacked up in piles.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:36): Gotcha. So, does it ever impede like the floor area, or maybe prevent you from using anything the way it's supposed to be used?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:47): Okay. Can you touch on that a little bit?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, before the area was packed up with boxes and things everywhere, um… my husband had wanted a pool table. But, there’s no room for a pool table because of all these boxes. Because of all this stuff!\n",
      "Interviewer (18:13): Right. So, are any rooms worse than others? I know you said the garage and the den were particularly bad, but are those, would you say, the most severely ported rooms in the house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I also have the office in my house, and it’s bad too.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:31): Gotcha. So, what kinds of things are, you know, part of these piles that you have hoarded? Are there like papers, or maybe like knickknacks? Anything in particular, or just kind of like everything?\n",
      "Interviewer (30:52): Right. So, when you had to accommodate your collections to somebody else, did you find that easy or was it difficult at first to get used to?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, it was a challenge.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:08): Okay, can you tell me a little bit about that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well again, it seems to me that with each passing month or season or whatever that I’m being squashed into a smaller portion. I’ve been told that by Christmas my son’s room needs to be cleared out.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:29): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Cause there’s gonna be company, and they need that room to be um, laying out their stuff while they’re staying here.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:43): Right. So, the room as is doesn’t really have enough room for someone else to be living in there?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right. It’s a clutter room.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:54): Okay, so, what about the non-clutter rooms in your house? Do they look normal or presentable?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:04): Okay. So, it’s really just confined to those certain areas of the house then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The areas that I’m allowed to clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:15): Right, okay. So, um, aside from being in someone’s home and kind of like being able to see whether they keep stuff or if certain rooms have a lot of things in them, how would you be able to tell if someone does hoard without being in their home? So, like what kind of personality traits do you think that you would witness in someone?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have no idea.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:42): Okay. So, in terms of yourself, do you think that there’s any sort of traits that might give away that you like to keep things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… I’m… I may not be insightful in recognizing that I have traits that someone might see as being a hoarder-type person. But um, I don’t think that anyone would be able to guess that my office looks like my office looks.\n",
      "Interviewer (33:22): Right. So, I know we talked a bit about um, determining whether things should be kept based on whether they have some sort of tactical use or whether you could make some money off of them. So maybe in recognizing those kinds of traits like uh, maybe like uh, financially focused in terms of things or like tactical or maybe even sentimental. Do you think those kinds of traits would maybe be a give to you whether someone might hoard or collect a lot of things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… again maybe my perception is not acute enough that I would pick up on things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:19): Okay. So, now I wanna talk a little bit about like where have you heard of hoarding disorder, if you have, like where did you get this information if you have?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, every once in a while I watch hoarders.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:36): Okay, so television. But anywhere else in your life have you heard about it or read about it or seen it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I don’t think so. I mean, hopefully I still qualify for the $30 gift card, is that-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, you, you participated so I would assume so.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to Dr. Matthews.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Avery? Or, not Avery, Dr. Mathews. Okay. Sounds good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Awesome thanks Avery.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have a great day.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, you too. Bye bye.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you, has your wife or kid every mentioned any, you, has it caused any sort of conflict?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, not really. Not as far as being told to get rid of things or anything like that. I haven’t experienced any of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what particular items do you keep? Like how do you decide if something is valuable or, or if you need to throw it away?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Normally if, you know, I, I guess I used something in the past, you know. Maybe even 6 months or so and I feel like there, you know I’ll be able to use it again. Then I think I would probably hold on to that. But, yeah, I think if I, you know if I don’t use something very often or if I never use something, then I'm fine to get rid of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you ever have trouble throwing something away? Does it cause any sort of anxiety? Having to discard things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not really, I don’t know. I guess for some reason I can’t, or, I, I, I have difficulty getting rid of bags and things like that. Like backpacks, or…\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so can you tell me more about this?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I probably have 4 or 5 backpacks or bags or stuff like that that I rarely use, but seem to not be able to, you know, get rid of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When we were doing the free listing prompts earlier, you mentioned collections as a reason to keep things. Is there anything else, I know you mentioned that you have some backpacks, but is there anything else you like to collect or have a lot of?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean I guess I have some shoes, like I like to collect shoes although I don’t have a ton of them but I do have several pairs that I never wear but I still hold on to them and don’t get rid of them for one reason or another. Some of them are a little uncomfortable but so I, I, rarely ever wear them but I still have them in my closet, you know. So if there’s ever a space that seems more cluttered than others it would be the closet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any other parts of your room or home, I know you said earlier that it’s not excessively cluttered, but is there anywhere else where maybe you have some things piled up that you’re not using?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I don’t, I mean like inside some of my dresser drawers there’s, or my nightstand there’s like papers in there and stuff like that that I have no idea what they are. Sorry-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What, what kind of papers?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I don’t know, they might be like financial statements or somewhat important documents but, that I don’t know what to do with or how to get rid of them or if I need them or anything like that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "We can't have people. We’re like kind of isolated right now. I wouldn't even let people like I'll be like, “I'll meet you at the restaurant.” They want to pick me up. I don't want you to pick me up because I don't want you to see this. They all know it.  People have offered to clean my house. I'm like, “No, you're not throwing my stuff out.”\n",
      "10:50 Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm hmm. Okay, so there's like I'm like a factor of shame, maybe.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "right.\n",
      "10:56 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and have you ever sought to change and this behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Sort of. Thinking that others could use some of the stuff.\n",
      "11:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm hmm. Right. Like you've mentioned that you're more cognizant about other people who could use your objects better than you could\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "11:18 Interviewer:\n",

      "why haven't you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably cuz i'm not i'm not being derogatory, that but I'm not like dirty. Because I’ve seen some. I have one dog. That's it. Because if it did ask. So I did one of those; I’m in another brain health thing for Alzheimers and it asked “how many pets do you have” and I had one. And my refrigerator is pristine. And it hasn’t caused be any health issues. That's probably says it the best,\n",
      "11:54 Interviewer:\n",

      "Okay. And how do your family and friends feel about this behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, considering my father did it.  I think my younger brothers do hoard. I think we all have that tendency. I've no idea why. We can't throw anything away because you may need it. And my father. Was very big on that. So I don't know what it just got drilled into us need it. Put it somewhere. I know that sounds odd but\n",
      "12:38 Interviewer:\n",
      "No, I like there's just like such a strong Like sense that it's been instilled in you as a child that you just continued it\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah like what if you need it later.\n",
      "12:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um, how do you think your friends feel about the behavior.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um sort of saying “do you need help cleaning this?” [unclear] I don’t think it bothers them that much because the house isn’t dirty, it's just cluttered. And you got to head this way, and then that way. Get on over there, and shut up and they know that. I wash my hands constantly, so they know I’m clean.\n",

      "That is correct. Not that I don’t think it’s an issue, but even if I did think that it was an issue it wouldn’t offend me.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:15): Right. But you said that it definitely could be an issue so there are some negative connotations that you might associate with it?\n",

      "Interviewer (36:02): Okay. So, if it were just you, or maybe before in your life when it was just you, did it upset you at all ever?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:14): Okay. So, if you lived at all by yourself for example, do you think it would bother you at all that you had these rooms that were a little bit cluttered?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um no, but it did probably limit my um… invitations to others to come into my home.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:41): Okay. So, was there ever a time when maybe you wanted someone in your home or to invite someone over and um, you felt limited because of you know the clutter, or because of a certain room in your house being disorganized or having stuff in it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I wouldn’t say that when I wanted to have someone come over, they would come over. The level of stuff was not such a big deal that I couldn’t stuff it all behind the curtains or walls or whatever so that it was not apparent at all at the point of time of the visitation.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:26): Okay, so, it seems like you’re saying that you’ve never really had so much stuff that it was impossible to, you know, clean it up a little bit for the sake of having someone over or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 056 (37:40)\n",
      "That is correct.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:42): Okay, so—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "(37:45) But, but I will acknowledge that some cleaning would take place before company would come over.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:52): Right, right. So, what would that cleaning up constitute? What would that look like for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It would just be um, repositioning boxes of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:08): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Sure having someone over, I would say no. Not like me being an…even intermittently working at home much [unclear].\n",
      "28:01 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So other than just like you wish that you could have like people over but that's about it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "28:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and has it ever impacted any relationships or your work?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would say no.\n",
      "28:21 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not. Yes. So I want to do more is organized them rather than get rid of them, but I'm not. I think I'm almost afraid to try to organize it, because I don't know how you’d organize this.\n",
      "28:40 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you're afraid of like starting to organize it just because you don't even know where you would start.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’d suppose you would start in one room but\n",
      "Interviewer 28:51Okay. And why would you like to change your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because eventually it's going to be cleaned.\n",
      "29:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it just goes back to that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I know that sounds bizarro but eventually we all go and I thought, oh my god.\n",
      "29:10 Interviewer:\n",
      "No, I've heard that before. That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "29:15 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, well, that was all the questions I had for you. Um, but I just need to collect a couple demographics.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "29:24 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um, so what is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Female\n",
      "29:28 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Was female\n",
      "29:31 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, your race?\n",
      "Participant 058\n",
      "Oh white.\n",
      "29:36 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 058 29:41\n",
      "I’m Italian, no\n",
      "29:43 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um your household income, you can just give me a general range.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It varies. I mean, I've lost to jobs. But generally, when I was working, you can put 50.\n",
      "29:56 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay 50,000?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "In a good year was 80\n",
      "30:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "okay\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "but I'm starting to wind down my work because I'm starting to look into retirement. Wooo\n",
      "30:06 Interviewer:\n",
      "Woo.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You sound young\n",
      "30:08 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um your geographic region northeast,\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Northeast\n",
      "30:14 Interviewer:\n",
      "I could tell. And then your highest level of education,\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Bachelor of Science.\n",
      "30:22 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, so that was all the demographics and now we discuss your gift card. So, do you have a preference for a physical or electronic gift card?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, actually they had sent; it this the same one. I think that sent us that other little visa.\n",
      "30:47 Interviewer:\n",
      "It’s probably a different one, because you wouldn’t have received it yet from this one.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, no. I think this is a continuation of that oh maybe I know I already like a little bit of one. You mean what I want. Doesn't matter to me.\n",
      "31:02 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you don't have a preference for physical or electronic?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah doesn’t matter.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:10): Okay. So, when you know, maybe if you were in college and you were living in a smaller space, or if you ever lived in an apartment, for example, um, and you had less space, how would you organize your stuff so that it never infringed on using your space or having people over?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It wasn’t an issue because I didn’t have stuff accumulated at that point in time. Hadn’t been alive long enough to accumulate stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:47): Right. So, can you remember when you first kinda noticed that you had been accumulating stuff? Was there ever a point when you realized you did have a lot of stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… I think it was just a gradual thing. As my available space expanded, rather than discarding things that didn’t have an immediate use but might have a potential use, I just held onto it instead.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:32): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, no particular time that I would identify.\n",
      "Interviewer (42:38): And, there was no time where maybe you accumulated a lot of stuff all at once from some sort of event? I know you mentioned earlier that if you had a relative pass that maybe you would accumulate—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would say that I added a large number of boxes of stuff and photos and things like that upon a death of a relative, but that would be the only time that there was an acute accumulation.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:09): Right. And otherwise it’s been more like, gradually as you like, accumulated stuff from life in general.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. If I need something and hmm, I don’t need it anymore, then instead of it going in the garbage it might go in the back room because someone might need it.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:27): So, we talked a lot about how your significant other was definitely, not always okay with um, the keeping of the stuff. But, has it ever impacted things other than your family and romantic relationships? Like has it ever impacted your work life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "Interviewer (43:49): Never, okay. SO how about, you know, your family as in your immediate family like your mother, your father, your siblings, have they ever had a problem with it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, not that they’ve mentioned.\n",
      "Interviewer (44:05): Okay. So, are they aware that you keep stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "They know what it looks like here.\n",
      "Interviewer (44:13): Right. And, how about anyone like a landlord or any sort of professional relationship like that? Ever impacted one of those?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "Interviewer (44:28): Okay, so, I just have a few more questions then and we can start wrapping up soon. But um, to kinda finish off, would you ever like to change this behavior? And if so, or if not, why?\n",
      "17:08 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, um, and I know that you mentioned that there's papers pretty much in every part of the home. But are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way they were intended, like other than like your stove and kitchen. Are there papers and just pretty much every room?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably not in the bedroom. I don't really; that’s mostly cluttered with clothes. Other than that…Yeah.\n",
      "17:40 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. What about your bathrooms?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I have one bathroom which is actually pristine. There's nothing in that bathroom. Nothing at all except the tub, the toilet, and the sink and a medicine chest with nothing but like toothbrush and toothpaste. I don’t know why.\n",
      "18:01 Interviewer:\n",
      "So you said that you have to navigate your certain way in order to walk through the home\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Especially, it's mostly from the living room into the den and around the kitchen table. Around the bed. And then there’s the bedroom with the gardening stuff in it.\n",
      "18:19 Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm hmm. Okay. Um, so now we're going to move on to our section about value. So, when you think about your possessions. What makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably the memories. I know it sounds silly but people who say that my house is cluttered continue to give me things. Like they come over and it's not [unclear]…  What the hell did you do with my lamp. Really. My best friend who's constantly “oh my gosh.” She constantly gives me things I'm thinking, well, what do you want to do. I like that stuff, but it's everywhere.\n",
      "19:11 Interviewer:\n",
      "So, memories makes your object valuable and how do you determine if an object is valuable, or not?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh usually if it was given to me by someone.\n",
      "19:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so if it has like sentimental value.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I'm looking around and 90% of the stuff I did not buy myself.\n",
      "19:34 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and what is trash for you, like, what do you throw away?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Anything that stained with any food.\n",
      "19:43 Interviewer:\n",
      "Anything that stained with any food?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right like, like I had soup for lunch that can that went well. It was one of those cans that you can’t recycle that and the in the garbage just came. I ran after the truck that went off with the garbage. See that I don't. 90% of what I throw out; I don't have much garbage, most of what I have is recycling.\n",
      "20:05 Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm hmm. Okay. And what is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Can it be the dog or is that ridiculous?\n",
      "20:18 Interviewer:\n",
      "No, that's valid but like an object that you collect?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh. It’s gotta be one? I like my holiday ornaments.\n",
      "20:33 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Which I need to put my Christmas ones away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you have any opinions about that show and how it depicts hoarding disorder? From any personal experiences that you’ve had?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, I think it definitely depicts them in maybe a more of a negative connotation I think even like a lot of my descriptive words for hoarding in the free list and things like that kin do portray that idea that like there’s definitely something more going on rather than just their hoarding disorder you know that it might be exacerbated by some underlying mental issue or something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, so, yes, you mentioned so anxiety and depression. Have you ever had any difficulties with any of these uncomfortable feelings and have they led you to maybe unnecessarily hold onto things in the past that would be any, like, concerning hoarding behavior? Considered concerning hoarding behavior? Or issues with clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I mean I can’t, I can’t really think of anything of the top of my head.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so this was, I didn’t know, this was supposed to be an interview with people who have issues with clutter or hoarding disorder, which I know some people who have issues with clutter don’t necessarily find their behavior concerning but maybe it leads to other interpersonal problems with family or different things, but you said earlier you do not have hoarding disorder, and from talking to you I, my impression is that you don’t seem to have any issues with clutter, sorry, it’s never caused any issues with anyone in your life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah that’s correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so I don’t know if the, if the rest of the question would apply. Do you think you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I don’t think so, I mean, we, you know we recently moved from Utah to Florida and so we tried to consolidate quite a bit of our stuff. So, yeah it wouldn’t, I wouldn’t necessarily say that we have too much stuff. Necessary, unnecessary stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you, okay, I’m looking over the questions. So would you say that in any way, hoarding causes any sort of issues in your daily life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Is there anything that you would like to change about the way that you keep or get rid of some items?\n",
      "Interviewer (45:25): Okay. And do you still identify as female today?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:30): Okay. And what's your race?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:34): Alright, so you wouldn't consider yourself Hispanic?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:39): Gotcha. Okay, so, if you could give me an estimate of your household income.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think about like forty thousand.\n",
      "Interviewer (45:51): Okay. And, last one is the geographic region that you live in in the US?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Southeast.\n",
      "Interviewer (46:02): Southeast? Okay then, perfect. So then, the last thing is just a question about the gift card. So, it's going to be a $30 amazon gift card. Would you prefer that it came electronically, or actually be sent to you in the mail?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Sent in the mail.\n",
      "Interviewer (46:21): Okay, perfect. So, then with that, um, I want to thank you so much for all your time and participating in the study. This information is really going to help us as we, you know, try and figure out, sort of like the stigmas and the attitudes people have towards hoarding disorder. So, I just want to say again, thank you so much for taking this time to help us out with this, and if you have any questions, I can of course give you the contact information for the main PI of the study. And you can also get in contact with the woman you were first in contact with about the study of course. But, do you have any questions for me?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, there’s nothing I can think of.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:01): Okay, perfect. Well, with that, I think that's all I have for you.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay, thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:08): Alright, thank you so much and you have a great day, okay?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "You too, bye.\n",
      "Interviewer (47:12): Bye.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "20:43 Interviewer:\n",
      "And  What would happen if you lost your Christmas ornaments? Like, is that something that you collect? Or do you have like a quote normal amount of them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think it's a normal amount.\n",
      "20:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, so what about, like all of your newspapers and papers. What happened, what would happen if you lost them?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "the scary part is I wouldn't even remember it.\n",
      "21:48 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um, okay. So, you don't think that you would be affected that much?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "See like this so much. I wouldn't even remember it. That's how ridiculous this whole thing is okay.\n",
      "21:27 Interviewer:\n",
      "And do you think that you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh god, yeah.\n",
      "21:34 Interviewer:\n",
      "And how do you decide when you have too much.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The house. It has things on places that like this chair in this den oh my god. It’s stacked up about three feet and that is not what a chair is supposed to be for. Using things like the bed isn’t supposed to have\n",
      "Spaker 1 22:01- So just like when things aren't being used as they're supposed to be used and instead they're being used as storage space.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "right.\n",
      "22:09 Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm hmm. Okay, um, And if you have to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 058 22:21\n",
      "Oh my god. Probably keep what means like if it; who it reminds me most of, I think,\n",
      "22:32 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's going back to that like sentimental value.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Like I know my sister in law gave me that and my best friend gave me that.\n",
      "22:41 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, so now we'll move on to the next section, which is about distinguishing hoarding disorder. Um, what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’m thinking when its not kept like it [unclear] its not in any organized fashion. Although, I'd say I treasure all this stuff. I may have the same type of item in 10 different places and I cannot quickly find where it is like if it meant that much. Why is it scattered and in such disarray? Like why can’t I organize it?\n",
      "23:34 Interviewer:\n",
      "So there's just like a general sense of disorganization and not being able to find things that even though you have several of you can't locate them\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right\n",
      "23:49 Interviewer:\n",
      "And is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder, without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No\n",
      "23:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not unless its spilled into the yard. I wouldn't think so.\n",
      "24:04 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and where do you, if you do, where do you get information about hoarding disorder like where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "This is ridiculous. They have a show on, have you seen hoarders?\n",
      "24:19 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. On like TLC?\n",
      "Participant 058 24:22\n",
      "055\n",
      "Interviewer (0:00): We’re recording. Okay, so for the first part of this interview, we're going to do what's called a free listing. So, before we start, I'm going to ask you what term you prefer when we're talking about issues with clutter, issues with hoarding\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible].\n",
      "Interviewer (0:20): Oh, no worries. So, basically, some people prefer a certain term when we're talking about having issues with clutter or hoarding, but is there any certain term that you prefer to use?\n",
      "Participant 055 (0:33)\n",
      "No, there’s not.\n",
      "Interviewer (0:34): Okay, so hoarding or hoarding disorders is fine?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (5:26): Okay. In that case, that's going to conclude the free listing part of the interview. So, the next part is going to be more like a general conversation. So, we're going to talk a little bit to begin with about your own particular experience with hoarding disorder. So, if you could tell me how long has this been going on? And, do you remember where, or when, or why it started?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "As far back as I can remember being young. Uh… as far as why, I don't know why. It just…\n",
      "Interviewer (6:08): Okay, so no particular like, age or memory where you first started hoarding something?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I was young. A young, young child.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:18): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, it's always been with me.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:23): And, in the beginning, what sorts of things were you hoarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Pretty much anything I touched.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:33): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Anything and everything.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:38): Nothing in particular that was, you know, a big thing that you wanted to hoard when you were younger?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Just everything. Everything was important.\n",
      "Interviewer (6:49): Right. So, in your childhood then, did it ever cause like any issues with your family? Did they ever like take notice of it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "They took notice, but they didn’t know what exactly do or what was wrong.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:10): Right. Okay. And so, you know, um, as you've gotten older, how would you say your clutter problems have evolved? How are they now?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "They’re just getting worse.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay, so what does it look like now for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I still have a hard time throwing things in the garbage. Uh… I struggle with it. Um… I’m always afraid that I might need something or might throw something away and might need it.\n",
      "Interviewer (7:52): Right. Okay, so, would you say that your behavior now is an issue, or is it a problem?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:03): Okay. Would you say it's severe?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Would I say that it is what?\n",
      "Interviewer (8:09): Severe.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[Inaudible]?\n",
      "Interviewer (8:14): Like a severe issue. Like it's a very drastic issue in your life.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, it is.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:22): Okay, so why, why would you say that then?\n",
      "057\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so, the first part of this interview is going to be a few free, free listing prompts. The interview is broken into two sections, and then after the freelisting we are gonna get into a more general conversation. But before we begin, I would like to ask, is there a specific term that you prefer to use, to use when discussing your difficulties with clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "[unintelligible 0:26] Specific term I like to use, discussing my difficulties with clutter?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, as in, some people don’t like the term hoarding so we like to ask.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, no. I, no, I don’t have any [unintelligible 0:41]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So hoarding is good?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yup. That’s fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so for the first part, thank you very much for doing that by the way, for the first part of our discussion, we’re going to start out talking about behavior and treatment seeking. So how long has, have your hoarding problems been going on?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Oh, gosh, I don’t know. I don’t really consider myself a hoarder per say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so-\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Am I supposed to be?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You used to be, you said?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Am I supposed to be?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, the study is, you don’t have to, the study is just for people who have issues with clutter or hoarding. But, so how long have you, would you describe yourself as having a lot of clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Gosh, I don’t know. I, I, like I said I wouldn’t necessarily consider myself having a lot of clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, how, can you please describe where you live now, is the, are there any rooms that maybe you can’t use?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "There’s not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you, have any of your friends or family member ever mentioned anything about your behavior or having issues with clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, not to my knowledge.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, well can you please describe for me what your home looks like now? Do you live with anyone else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I live with my wife and my little daughter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is the space like? Are there any, you mentioned that you odn’t think it’s cluttered?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, I wouldn’t say it’s cluttered much, I mean, I think like every house it tends to get in disarray I guess with unfolded clothes and stuff like that. But as far as clutter goes, you know I mean I guess there are things on my bathroom counter and things on my dresser and stuff like that, that need to be put away, but as far as like not being able to use any rooms or things like that due to clutter or hoarding, that’s not the case in, in our house. You know, we’re definitely able to get around any of the rooms with clear, unobstructed pathways, and things like that, so.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I guess I would choose the one that I thought was most likely to be… um… put to use by someone at some point in the not too distant future.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:34): Okay. Alright, so, now we’re going to talk a little bit about distinguishing between collecting things or liking to have some stuff around and behavior that could potentially be problematic. So, in your opinion, what do you think are the most important differences between what’s considered like, normal saving behavior and um, hoarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well I guess, oh and again it’s an external thing, if nobody else can see the value of what you are retaining um, that makes it a little bit more of a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:25): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… if it is not as easy to put a, for instance a financial value on something, um, it in other people’s eyes might be more of a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:46): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant 056 (2:47)\n",
      "Um, but… restate the question please.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:52): Yeah, sure. So, what do you think are the most important differences between what’s considered normal saving behavior and hoarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And I guess if you have too many of the same sort of thing it’s not, you know, like you’re collecting baseball cards or something for the purpose of having a collection, um, then that getting, you certainly wouldn’t want to accumulate too many crescent wrenches or something along those lines. Uh, so I guess the, again, for me, it’s to some degree an external perception issue more than an internal perception issue in that, um…\n",
      "Interviewer (28:56): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Hmm, I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:01): it’s okay. So, in your opinion, if you had to identify someone with hoarding disorder, what might that look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It might look like my office expanded to occupy the entire home.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:20): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And I suppose again, to me, it would concern if it resulted in um, a health or hygiene issue being raised, or it exceeded the ability to maintain a clean environment or I should say, I guess a clean environment might be to your interpretation, I guess a hygienic environment. Uh…\n",
      "Interviewer (30:03): So, when it would become a hazard you would definitely say that it would be more like hoarding disorder, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. That would definitely be more of a concern than someone that just had a lot of stuff and they had the wherewithal to accommodate this stuff without it being a hazard to their health or to other people’s health.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:31): Right. So, in your case, it’s never really been an issue that was, you know a health threat or anything to anyone, or you know a potential danger to anyone? It’s never really been like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The only danger would be to me if a significant other were to pop me in the head because I didn’t get moved what she wanted me to move.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you describe the rest of your house? Like how big is it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s two bedrooms, two and a half baths. So my wife and I have a bedroom and our little baby has a bedroom and bath and then downstairs we have like a living space that’s kind of continuous with the small kitchen and dining area and the garage and that’s about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there anything that you would change about your home and how you organize things in it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Anything that I would change or how I’d organize it… not really, I mean I can’t think of anything right now, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So how would you distinguish what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, or hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah I would say like if the, if the collecting goes into like, if it, if it affects functionality or if it affects other areas in your life, then that would maybe move it to hoarding. For instance if you can’t, you know, move freely within your own home, or if, if there’s even like infestations of animals or insects or things like that that you are unaware about, and I feel like that would move into kind of like a hoarding situation.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you’ve never experienced any of these problems or had any sort of difficulties when it comes to clutter?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So how would you say that your behavior is different from what you would depict as a hoarder, or hoarding behaviors?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I mean, I don’t, I don’t feel any anxiety when I do get rid of something. Like for instance even if somebody, you know, kind of coerced me or forced me to get rid of something I don’t think that I would feel super anxious or even angry about something. I mean unless it obviously had like a lot of, a lot of, a lot of considerable meaning to me but as far as you know everyday materialistic things then I don’t have a problem with getting rid of those things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any ways that you could tell if someone had hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Without being in their home? Maybe if I noticed them like holding onto things that, you know, one might normally not hold onto like you know, yeah I don’t know I mean I think it would be difficult to tell if anybody was a hoarder outside of their own home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Where do you get information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, let’s see, I guess I mean I’ve had personal experiences moving people out of their homes and, and they would have what I consider hoarding disorder. Or I’ve also watched the shows on TLC and stuff like that where they kind of follow hoarders so that’s probably where I get most of my information I guess is-\n",
      "Interviewer (22:42): Right. Did it ever cause any conflict between her and you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, because of me not being able to have friends over because of the chaos.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:53): Okay, so you've kind of experienced what you mentioned earlier that your husband has an issue with now, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:02): Okay, so, I could imagine it's easy for you to sympathize with him because you've experienced that before.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:10): Right. So, when you guys talk about having people over or not being able to have people over, you know, what kinds of things are said in those conversations?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, that he wants me to get it cleaned up.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:25): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "He just wants me to throw everything in the trash.\n",
      "Interviewer (23:31): And, what do you usually respond with? What, what do you tell him?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That I’m going to move it [laughing].\n",
      "Interviewer (23:37): Mhmm. Alright, so, in terms of your possessions, what do you think makes them valuable or worth keeping around?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s mental. Um… I was looking for something that may be valuable, um, worth something.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:03): So, by that do you mean that you go out shopping looking for these things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, not really anymore. Not much. It's just, you know, now, these things are here. So…\n",
      "Interviewer (24:26): Mhmm. Alright, so, sentimentality is definitely important for you in terms of what makes your things valuable. But, how about like money or like actual monetary value?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, that's what I keep hoping for I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer (24:42): Right. So, anything in particular that you keep around because you hope it'll kind of accumulate money or value?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I have some old money. Like, Confederate money that I kept. Uh…\n",
      "Interviewer (25:02): Anything else like that, or no?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, not that I can think of at all.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:09): Gotcha. Okay, so, on the other side of the spectrum, what's trash for you? So, like, what's something that you have no issue at all throwing away?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I don't, I don’t know. Food wrappers, things like that. Uh… um… boxes. Like I don’t like to look at them. Uh, I think that’s about it.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:36): Gotcha. Okay, so certain things are for you, really easy to throw away and you don't have any desire to keep them, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:45): Okay, so, in terms of the items that you have in your house, what's your most precious item?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, pictures.\n",
      "Interviewer (25:57): Okay. So, are these like pictures and picture frames, or like photo albums?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I just have boxes that are just like pictures waiting there.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:11): Mhmm. Alright, so, why are these pictures valuable for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Memories.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:17): Okay. So, if you were to suddenly lose these pictures, it would be pretty upsetting for you because of the memory that’s lost, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:43): Right. So, have you ever sought to change this behavior or has anyone ever suggested that you find help for this behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I work on, as I’d say, periodically figuring out ways to strategically decumulate but, um… that, that moves at a slow pace.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:11): Right, so, never before have you—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "So, I’m, I’m not, the only way I would be seeking help would be to find the right place for these things to be distributed to.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:26): Okay, but in terms of collecting things in general, you don’t really see it as a problem?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, I don’t. I mean I’m not actively accumulating things at this point in time.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:43): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Just the management. It’s a, a space management issue.\n",
      "Interviewer (16:49): Okay. So, in terms of the things that you do keep, how important are these things to you? So, why do they have value for you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think um, in my opinion, my perception of their value is, uh, a result of what I perceive their intrinsic value to be. So, again, there are things that I’m not using, I don’t think I’m gonna use, but I think that they have a use, and it’s just a matter of finding the right, the right custodian for whatever that particular item is.\n",
      "Interviewer (17:38): Okay. So, these things that you keep in your home, do they ever infringe upon the normal use of your home? So, is there any like rooms that you can’t necessarily move around too much in, or is there any appliances that you can’t necessarily use because there’s stuff on them? Or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Everything is accessible.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:02): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Although my office is, um, a little bit more challenging than it used to be when I had more space to disperse the stuff around the house. Um, but no, there is, there’s no loss of functionality anywhere in the home.\n",
      "Interviewer (18:21): Okay. So, in terms of when you’re trying to determine when you should get rid of something or not, what kinds of values do you place on it to determine if you should throw it away? Like what makes something valuable enough to keep?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean I think I would, it would be good to have, you know after having this conversation or whatever it definitely would be good to have maybe a time of the year or a couple times of the year where you go through your stuff, especially like clothes and, and shoes and things like that and kind of make that decision, you know, have I used this thing, if not, then, you know, it, it would probably be good to get rid of those things and so, maybe just having like a system in place where you kind of go through things or even renew things that have maybe worn out or you know lost their shine or whatever. I think, you know, getting rid of the old and bringing something in new might even provide some new energy in my life overall, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you had to change anything now, I know you mentioned earlier that if someone made you get rid of things you would not be bothered, but if you had to change anything about your behavior now regarding clutter or keeping things, would it upset you at all, aside from, I, you mentioned the like personal sentimental items. Like say, you said you have maybe some backpacks you don’t use. If your wife had you throw all of those away tomorrow would that be upsetting to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah, okay, yeah. I mean if you, if you, if I had to throw all of them away tomorrow I would probably be a little perturbed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have, and once again, has this impacted any sort of relationship, or have, have your issues with potential clutter impacted any sort of relationship in your life, whether its landlords, family members, romantically?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, they haven’t.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, well, I think the interview will end early then, because we have covered pretty much everything. So once again, thank you for participating. Before you, I would like to get some demographic information from you, is that okay?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yup.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Male? Is that the same as your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Caucasian, white.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And ethnicity, are you hispanic or nonhispanic?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Nonhispanic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is the highest degree or level of school that you’ve completed?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Bachelor’s.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Bachelor’s? What is your average household income, approximately?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right now, 17,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Which geographic region best describes where you live?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Geographic region?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like northeast, midwest, south?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "South Florida. South.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Thank you so much for participating. If you have nay questions or are concerned with anything, feel free to reach out to the woman you were in contact with when you signed up for this study. Is there anything else that you would like to ask or discuss?\n",
      "058\n",
      "00:01 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, so As you know, the study is investigating individual’s attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. So, the first question would be what term do you prefer, when we were talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Uh, clutter is alright.\n",
      "07:26 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, thank you so much. Um, so now we're going to move on to the second part of our interview, that's a little bit more conversational. So, I'll just ask you a question. And then you can answer any way you see fit. So, this first section is about behavior and treatment seeking, so can you please describe your hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It's I am, I am a collector, but I'm not unsanitary. My plumbing works electricity works in a refrigerator is pristine. But if I'm looking around my house now there are stacks of papers. The kitchen table is not usable, the stove is barely usable. The living room. You can barely maneuver through it. Because all the while clean things, I still can't get rid of them or not, they’re just sitting there clean, till they get dirty again. The bed has clothes all over it because I have too many clothes. I mean, as I'm looking around.\n",
      "08:39 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And how long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably like 40 years.\n",
      "08:50 Interviewer:\n",
      " 40 years? okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah. Like it's hereditary but one of my brothers does it even worse.\n",
      "08:57 Interviewer:\n",
      "And did your parents ever exhibit similar behaviors?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "My father.\n",
      "09:04 Interviewer:\n",
      "Your father did okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It was awful\n",
      "09:08 Interviewer:\n",
      "Um, and how severe would you say that this behavior is now?  Like is it better? Is it worse than before?\n",
      "Participant 058 09:17\n",
      "It might be a tad better actually,\n",
      "09:20 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And why do you think it's better?\n",
      "Participant 058 09:27-\n",
      "Because I wanted the… I keep saying to myself, like there's a Salvation Army up the street and there's a Big Sisters.  They need this these clothes more than you do they need these glass way more than… You know what I mean?\n",
      "09:42 Interviewer:\n",
      "Right. So, you had like a little bit more self-discipline,\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "right, like if I'm not going to use this and it's in beautiful shape all these Macy’s [unclear] didn't fit, that were beautiful. Why should I keep them when people can wear them… You know what I mean? No, let me try to do that.\n",
      "10:00 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you've just had like more understanding recently.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "10:06 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and so you do believe that your behavior is a problem, then. Correct?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "10:13 Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm hmm. And can you elaborate on why you think it's a problem, please?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I mean, I would now which we’re not allowed. Are you in [location]? I don’t know if you are\n",
      "10:25 Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah I’m in [location].\n",
      "Interviewer (12:06): Okay, so what areas in particular do you keep your things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I am allowed to keep my things in the garage.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:15): Okay.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "In my office, and in my son’s bedroom who has moved out ten years ago.  College, you know for college, has not moved back in.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:30): So, if you were to describe the areas where you do keep your things, you know like the garage or your son’s room, what would you describe them as looking like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, my son’s room is the worst because it’s full of his stuff, which I have on many occasions asked which of his stuff I can get rid of. And so far he has not, um, felt a need to purge any of the stuff that he has because, you know, he’s got his own living space and this doesn’t bother him because he’s not here, and his room has not yet been hijacked for other purposes. So, that room is cluttered, full of kid’s stuff— toys and clothes, toys mostly and some clothes, but mostly just toys and his childhood furniture. Um, my office is full of all sorts of things like old electronics, and computers, and stereos and things that still work just fine, but I have not been able to find the right home for. Although, periodically I put things on Craigslist, now is definitely not a very good time to try to sell stuff on Craigslist. Everybody is locked up at home and I would think that they would all be online looking for stuff to get, but apparently that’s not the case.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:52): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, and I have retained my, um, library of books and textbooks from forever and ever. And, unfortunately since my child had lots of toys and stuffed animals some of them are in there as well, and um, there’s boxes of cars, things, assorted wall hanging that have one time or another been on walls but are currently just stacked up in there. And when a, uh, ancestor passed away a few years ago, I became the custodian of all the family photo albums dating back to, to the 1930s and there’s hundreds of them.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:47): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Nobody else in the family will take them so I’m stuck with them, and I don’t have an issue holding on to them until someone either decides that they are interested or until I [inaudible] them and they can throw them out if they want to.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:01): Right. So, you mentioned that you definitely are a more of an organized person, so there’s a level of organization to your stuff for your rooms that have your stuff in them.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "To some degree, but when the other citizen moved in here that became a little more of a challenge because my space that was allocated to me became compressed and I had to fit more stuff into less space. And on a now basis, so some organization has been lost.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:23): Gotcha. So, that house was more severely hoarded than the one now, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right, but the one we have now is a good bit bigger.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:33): Right. So, is there any particular reason you bought it bigger?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, for all of the belongings.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:48): Right. So, would you say that hoarding contributed to you wanting to buy a bigger house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:56): Gotcha. Alrighty, so, I'm going to jump back a little bit back to kind of talking about hoarding disorder in general. So, when you hear the words “hoarding disorder,” what do you think about? Do you have any sort of like values assigned to that, or like any negative or positive connotations that come to mind?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, because I kinda understand.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:20): Right. So, it's pretty neutral for you to hear those words?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:27): Right. And, I could kind of tell by the way that you didn't have a problem with, you know, just calling it hoarding disorder in the very beginning. So, for you, it's more just like a fact sort of thing?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (35:41): Okay. So, now we're going to talk a little bit more about how hoarding disorder has interfered with your life. So, I know we, we kind of touched earlier on how it's created some conflict with your husband, and kind of prevented you from seeing certain people or having certain people over. So, I want to ask whether your behavior upsets you?\n",
      "Participant 055 (36:06)\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:07): Okay, and why would you say it upsets you the most?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, you know, because it affects your whole life. Um, there’s so many things you, um…. It just seems like there’s so much stuff and it’s just in the way. But you’re not able to do very much about it.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:36): So, you feel kind of helpless then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:41): Alright. And, do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (36:48): Okay. So, in what ways does it affect your day to day life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, it’s just, you’re so busy dealing with all the stuff that you can’t really have a life.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:11): Alright. And when you say dealing with the stuff, what does that mean?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, when I’m at my mom’s I am trying to deal with all of this stuff. Because, you know, she’s coming to the end of her life and something has to be done. And, and I just can't get through it very fast.\n",
      "Interviewer (37:37): Mhmm. So, the going through her possessions and seeing what we need to get rid of, that is what's most interfering with your daily life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, it would be nice if I was not having to sleep on a couch, because the couch is not very comfortable.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:01): Definitely not as good as a bed. I could, I could imagine.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:29): Gotcha. Okay, so you consider yourself to have hoarding disorder then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:36): Right. Okay so where do you get information about hoarding disorder? Where did you first hear about it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "On the internet.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:47): Okay. Any other places?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:51): Gotcha. And, did this come about because, you know, you're curious about your own behavior, or something else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Me to define my own behavior and look for help.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:05): Gotcha. So, this was kind of like when you were seeking that psychiatrist you mentioned earlier then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:13): Gotcha. Okay, so, have you ever met anybody else who has hoarding disorder, other than your mother?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I have a friend that’s a hoarder, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:27): Okay. So, how can you tell?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "When you can't walk very well in her house. Everything is according to her, and everything is sentimental, and anything anybody’s ever given to her she keeps.\n",
      "Interviewer (31:47): Right. So, were there any clues about her having hoarding disorder, or was it just from being in her home that you are able to realize that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s from being in her own home.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:01): Okay, so you don't think there's any sort of personality traits that people with hoarding disorder tend to show?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Not that I know of.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:10): Right. Okay, so, did you after seeing your friend's home, did anything like click into place or suddenly makes sense about her?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, after seeing her house then I could kind of— like I should’ve known\n",
      "Interviewer (32:37): Okay. So, why do you feel that you should have known?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, just from talking to her. That everything is important to her.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:48): So, she verbalizes that a lot, that things are important?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (32:53): Gotcha. So, what kinds of things would she usually say are important?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Anything anybody has given her, anything that has been someone else’s, and she has, uh…\n",
      "Interviewer (33:18): Alright, sorry I thought you were saying something she had. Okay, so, everything people have given her is important. So, how about for you? Does that differ from your own behavior or your own values?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I know I can’t keep everything everybody’s given me. I’ve realized that. Eventually when it becomes a problem, um…\n",
      "Interviewer (33:47): Right. So, was there ever a point in your life where, you know, your hoarding behaviors were more severe than they are now?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, uh, when my son was alive we had a half of the living room and one of the bedrooms. I kept every little toy that he ever had. So, one of the bedrooms could not be used because you couldn’t walk in there.\n",
      "Interviewer (34:17): Right. Was this a different house than the one we were talking about earlier?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, it was.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, in the living room I have tons and tons of papers. Just paperwork that I’ve got to go through and see if there’s anything important I need to keep. And, at this point, other papers have gotten mixed up with the papers, like, from my mother’s house that I’ve got to work on going through. And, uh, the garage and… it’s just, uh, stuff I brought from my mother’s that I need to take a second look at while I’m going through things. So, the same way with the [inaudible] and the two out-buildings. It’s just stuff that I need to just, take the time to go through and kind of decide what’s what.\n",
      "Interviewer (19:39): Right. So, how about any like objects in your house? Are there any, are there any objects that you can't use the way they're supposed to be used? Like, maybe you can't use a stove because there's stuff on top of it? Or, maybe a bedroom or, you know, anything like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, the office you can't use very well because of all the boxes. Um…\n",
      "Interviewer (20:11): But that's about it for you? Other than that, nothing else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "That’s pretty much it at the moment.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:24): Right. Okay, so, ideally, what would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "All organized, clean, um… not chaos everywhere.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:43): So, a lot of people find comfort in, you know, the things that they keep. But, it sounds like to me, that for you, it's more of a stress to have all these things, and you don't really have like personal attachments per se to them, but you just haven't gotten around to, you know, sorting through them. Is that about right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I do have some, some uh… personal value, where I would say things like from your childhood that you want to keep. And, I mentioned I’m staying at my mother’s house right now. It’s a three-bedroom house, and two of the bedrooms, uh… I’m having to sleep on the couch because two of the bedrooms you can’t get into. Because of all— you can’t you can’t walk in the bedrooms. One of the bedrooms has a mattress and back spring but they’re up against the wall. You can’t walk inside the door. Uh, so I guess I come through this naturally.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:02): Mhmm. So, when you were growing up was your mom a hoarder, you know, when you were a kid, or did this develop later?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "She was a hoarder also.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:13): Okay, so you definitely saw some of this behavior when you were growing up.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:21): Right. And, did it ever cause any conflicts between her and her husband, or her and any of her friends?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, between her and her husband. But she was always able to use the excuse that she worked and, you know, um…\n",
      "056\n",
      "Interviewer (8:18): Okay, so that’s going to conclude our free listing section of the interview. So, the next section is going to more kinda like a general conversation. So, I’m going to ask you questions about, um, your hoarding in particular, your space, like why you value your possessions, and things like that. And again, I just wanna remind you if any of these questions make you uncomfortable you don’t have to answer and you can always ask me to rephrase if something’s confusing or otherwise, you know, you don’t understand something or a part of a question. Alright?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:53): Okay so, first off, if you could just describe to me your particular hoarding or clutter problems. Like how long has this been going on and how would you describe it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, I would say that I have been strategically accumulating for a number of years. And, it’s… it probably started because I had plenty of space and there wasn’t any need to be getting rid of stuff that might have a purpose later on at some point in time.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:31): Mhmm.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um… and I guess eventually if you save enough stuff, you start being, um, challenged for space. Uh… and, when other people elect to share your space with you, that becomes more of an issue. Um…\n",
      "Interviewer (9:58): Okay, so—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And again, uh, I would say that my hoarding is— was, not a big deal to me because I’m an organized hoarder, until someone else joined my household, and their interpretation of organization appeared to be a little different than my interpretation of organization.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:33): Right. So, when did this all begin? Can you remember a specific time when you started collecting things?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, not really.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:43): Okay, so just kind of like throughout your life?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:49): So, you mentioned that when you brought someone else into your household, they kinda had a problem with it. So, I wanna touch a little bit more on that. Have you ever had conflicts with the people that are close to you, like the person you mentioned or maybe even someone like a landlord, or anyone else in your family maybe?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I would say that there’s occasionally some conflict between me and my significant other.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:13): Okay, and for what reason?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because she is on the other end of the accumulation spectrum, and she likes to have a clean, orderly, uncluttered uh, environment in which to um, exist. Uh, and... she’s continuously cleaning, organizing, and doing things along those lines. So sometimes we are at odds with each other.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:48): Right, so—\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And fortunately, we have space, so she’s been able to, uh, partition things in a manner which allows me to keep my stuff in certain areas as long as I don’t encroach into other areas.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, yes. And, when there’s two bedrooms that aren’t being used because of all that stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:12): Mhmm. So, you know, before you were going through your mom’s stuff, did it ever get in the way of, you know, your daily life back at home trying to get rid of stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, at home, I was just kind of putting off going through stuff there to keep up with the normal types of activities as far as washing clothes and washing dishes like that. And I was not doing anything about the stuff there.\n",
      "Interviewer (38:51): Right. So, you know, having to deal with your mom’s stuff has definitely, you know, made you look more at the process of getting rid of stuff and determining what's valuable.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:05): Gotcha. So, do you think it's going to make it easier for you in your own house to do that, now that you've kind of been forced to do it with your mom’s stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I hope so, but most likely I’ll go right back to the way I was before. Just working on laundry and dishes, rather than getting into it.\n",
      "Interviewer (39:31): Right, you know, finding ways to, you know, not quite look at it all the time. I understand. So, I know we said that it definitely caused some conflict with your husband, but, um, how about anybody else in your family?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. Now, my son when he was alive, he was upset about it. Because he, because he had one bedroom that he could not use.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:04): Right. So, why couldn’t he use that bedroom then?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Because I wanted to keep everything. So, we had one bedroom that was, that I kept all of his toys and belongings in.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:21): Mhmm. So, was that like a guest room or was it his actual bedroom?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, we had a three-bedroom house. So, he has one bedroom. The other bedroom was a good bit bigger, the one I kept putting any kind of his toys or old clothes in.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:44): Gotcha. Did it ever prevent him from having friends over?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (40:54): Okay. Do you have any specific memories of that happening?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, just by him. The cycle I guess just alone, where he was embarrassed also having people over.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:12): Right. So, how about, you know, your own friends. Are you, you said that your husband was embarrassed for, you know, the idea of having people over, and your son was embarrassed, but were you also embarrassed?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, but I don't, we don’t really have many people over because of the stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:39): Right. Has there ever been a time where you had more people over?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (41:47): Right. Okay, so, how about any of your work relationships? Has it ever impacted anything like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, no I don’t think so.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, we don’t let very many people come over. Uh, it’s just rare. Um…\n",
      "Interviewer (12:12): Okay, so, is there, you know, any sort of like fights that you've had about it or, or what does your husband say about it?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, he, he gets mad about it because he’s embarrassed. He wants to be able to have people come over, and friends come over, and, you know he can’t do that because he’s embarrassed.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:40): Mhmm. So, was there ever a time where you were able to have more friends over, and now, like, that's less of an option for you? Or was it always kind of like this?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It’s always been like this.\n",
      "Interviewer (12:54): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "And he’s always been mad about this. But, I always feel like I’m doing the best I can. I can’t do anything different.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:07): Mhmm. So, obviously there's some conflict between you and your husband about it. But, how about any of your friends? How do they feel about that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I mean I don’t say anything. Uh… You know, their idea is just throw it away, where for everyone, you know, it’s just not that easy to do.\n",
      "Interviewer (13:41): Right. Yeah, I can understand it's very difficult in this case, and oftentimes people will have a hard time understanding that. So, how about your parents, or maybe some siblings, if you have any?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I don't have any siblings, but my mother is a hoarder. So, um… and, at the moment I am staying with her and working out of her house. And, it is going very [inaudible; (14:16)] since this is something that has to be done. Because, you know, she’s 83 and it’s just a matter of time with her health. So, I’m needing to get her health cleaned up.\n",
      "Interviewer (14:33): So, how are you finding that process? Is it easier for you to clear out your mother's house than, you know, clearing out your own possessions?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, it is. It's just, I'm just very slow. I always think that, you know, I want to be careful about throwing things away, I don’t want to throw anything away that’s valuable or, you know, important, or I need. But, you know, now I'm in a situation where this is a have to.\n",
      "Interviewer (15:07): Right. So, it has made it a bit easier now that it's kind of an essential thing you need to do?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "A little, a little.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, do I have a use for it now? Do I know someone that has a use for it now? Might I have a use for it in the near future? Might I know someone who will have a use for it in the near future? Um, is it something that I can uh, realize um, financial reward for? In other words, is it something that’s sellable that someone else might have a use for and I can get rid of it by selling it to Craigslist, or is it something that um, has an appropriate place to be donated to, like um, the [place; (19:21)] or the [place; (19:24)] or whatever, where some of my stuff periodically makes its way to? Or, um, again, is it just something that holds sentimental value to me or is perceived by me to potentially hold sentimental value to someone else. So again, when you retain things from people that have moved on to a different plane of existence and it’s, you know,  antique-kinda stuff that’s interesting or intriguing or whatever, I hate to just toss it in the garbage even though it has no apparent use to me at this point in time. Just haven’t gotten around to finding it it’s proper home yet.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:14): Right. So, do you ever disagree with your significant other or really anyone else about what might be sentimental or not, or what might potentially be useful?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Um, only when she has stuff that she wants to keep but doesn’t want in her space. Something that gets sent to me.\n",
      "Interviewer (20:42): Okay, so, why would you maybe think that something might be sentimental or that something might be useful if someone else didn’t think so? Have you ever like, had a situation like that where you really, truly believed that something was gonna be sentimental or useful in the future, or sellable like you said, and someone else didn’t agree?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Actually, I can’t say that I have.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:06): Okay, so usually people agree with you’ve determined that something is worth keeping?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well yes, it’s just that it… they may not… um… they may not have the same perception of whether it’s worth keeping up space with these items while you’re waiting to find what its use should be.\n",
      "Interviewer (21:39): Right. Okay so, in terms of all your possessions, what do you think is probably the most valuable thing that you own?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Hmm… hmm… I don’t know. I mean, I guess from a monetary standpoint my car! But as far as possessions in the house, there isn’t anything particularly valuable either financially or sentimentally that stands out above other stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer (22:31): Okay, so if you were to lose any one thing in your possession, it wouldn’t particularly upset you?\n",
      "13:52 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Okay. Um, so now we'll move on to our second section which is about space and living area. Um, so I know that you've said that, like your dining room table. And like your kitchen and stove are like not very usable because there's so much stuff, but could you please describe like just describe your house and you said that it takes some time to maneuver. So, can you just elaborate on that.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "It's mostly paper or magazines. On the stove mostly paper magazines, on the table. And then there's a table in between the living room and the den, because I intermittently work from home. So that's where I set up and I decided just to leave it there. And now this papers on top of that and cards because I love sending cards to people. And then this. I mean, I'm looking at this, my all my Christmas stuff clean sitting on top of a plastic container that needs to be put away. And all this other stuff I cleaned and then the couch in the living room has clothes stacked up to the ceiling and then the chair and this den sitting in has 1, 2, 3 boxes and hundred pieces of paper. And there's the dog. He's clean And then I have a spare bedroom that, I got so lazy, I just put all my gardening stuff in it, which is horrible because the floors are all hard wood and they’re gorgeous. And there's like maybe a 6 by 6 feet tall thing of all gardening stuff, stuffed back there and I put all my plants out there in there, but now they're out. And I did start cleaning cupboards or at least they're a little bit better. My bedroom I’m looking in it. There's a rack with all clean clothes, the bed has all clean clothes, boxes of clean clothes. Oh, yeah.\n",
      "15:59 Interviewer:\n",
      "And I know that you said that you have a dog. But other than that, you live alone.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "16:07 Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Um, and what would you like your house to look like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I want all of the boxes and papers either recycled, composted, or put somewhere. Another stacks. It's the problem. I keep telling myself, “most of the things I have, you can find this online.” If I see an interesting article on local such and such. I gotta read that local teas, local dining, local chocolates. And I'll just keep stacking everything up. But I'm like “I can find that online.” I've no idea what is the point in this. Looking at it…\n",
      "16:54 Interviewer:\n",
      "So you said that you, you collect a lot of papers and your houses like obviously filled with papers. And is that just because you feel like you want to read them again like?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, my husband is embarrassed for anyone to come to our house, so we can’t have friends over. It changes your life as far as being able to have relatives or anyone come to your house, or just to get some work done in your house is a panic.\n",
      "Interviewer (8:51): Right. So, have you ever sought to change this behavior, like going to professional? I think you mentioned earlier that you had tried going to get help before.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:03): Okay, and how did that go?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Well, I mean, um, I went to a psychiatrist, he put me on medication. Went to, uh, was it a psychologist? Anyways, it was someone that you talk to. And, his, his idea was to try not to do it. And all that did was put more stress on me to try not to do it. It's easier just to do.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:37): Right.\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Do the thing you need to do.\n",
      "Interviewer (9:41): Okay, so he kind of told you that it was better to just not do it at all. He didn't sort of give you any like coping mechanisms or anything?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No. He was just mostly, you know, try not to do it, and then that was more stressful.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:00): Right. So, during that time when you were, you know, in therapy for that and you were trying to follow his advice, and it was making your life more stressful, what did that look like? Did it make your hoarding worse? Did it make it slightly better? Or did it create new strain in your relationships, or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Just put more stress on me. It made things harder where it was just easier to do things the way I've always done.\n",
      "Interviewer (10:31): Okay, so you did try and actively follow his advice, but found yourself falling short? Or, you kind of more so, didn’t know how to do that, so you just kind of kept on doing what you were doing?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I tried, but it just, it just wasn’t working. It was too much stress. It was just easier to do things the way I always have.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:04): Right. So, this psychiatrist that you went to, how did you hear about him? Or how did, how did you find this person?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I think I went on the internet and found him.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:17): Okay. So, did you search for specific psychiatrists for hoarding disorder or just psychiatrists in general?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "For hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:29): Gotcha. Okay. So, you went on the internet then, but it wasn't like a recommendation by anyone else right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (11:39): Okay, so, um, I want to go back to, when you were saying earlier that your husband was embarrassed about, you know, the hoarding and it, you know, created some strain there. I want to talk about how maybe your family, or your friends feel about your behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:28): Okay, so, um, sentimentality seems to be like a pretty big deal in terms of, you know, why you think things are valuable. Would you say that's fair?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:42): Alright. So, in your personal opinion, do you think you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (26:48): Alright, so, how do you know that?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I’ve just got stuff everywhere. Um…\n",
      "Interviewer (27:01): Right, so because it takes up so much space in your house?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:07): Gotcha. So, I know we talked a little bit earlier about, you know, distinguishing between what's trash and what's worth keeping. But, if you were to say, choosing between keeping two items, what kinds of traits would you look at? Or, what kinds of things would you look at in terms of choosing the more important item to keep?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "If it’s something I would use or need.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:33): Okay, usefulness, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:38): Okay, anything else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer (27:41): Alrighty. So, what are some things that you keep that you keep for the purpose of usefulness?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Kitchen things that would be used. Uh… you know, bedroom-type things, towels washcloths.\n",
      "Interviewer (28:09): Okay. And, are those things that you keep in normal amounts of, or things that you hoard a lot of?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "A lot of.\n",
      "Interviewer (28:18): Gotcha. So, you know, um, these things that you hoard a lot of that are useful, do you think it's necessary to have them in so many, in such a big amount?  Or do you think that you just kind of, you know, choose to keep them around because you feel like they'll be useful later?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "I feel like they’ll be useful later.\n",
      "Interviewer (28:42): Right. Okay, so, when it comes to, you know, trying to discard things, do you find it easier to discard something that might be useful or discard something that's sentimental to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Something useful or what?\n",
      "Interviewer (29:04): Or something that's sentimental to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Probably I’d choose sentimental.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:12): Okay. So, it's easier to throw away something that's sentimental to you?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer (29:18): Gotcha. Alright, so, now we're going to talk a little bit about how we distinguish hoarding disorder from, you know, normal behavior that is like collecting behavior. So, in your opinion, what do you think the most important differences are between, you know, what's considered normal and what's hoarding?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Where you're having problems using rooms or walking\n",
      "Interviewer (29:55): So, when it becomes like an obstacle in the house. That's an issue, right?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:02): Okay, anything else?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "No, I think that’s pretty much it. When you can’t use rooms or…\n",
      "Interviewer (30:12): Mhmm. So, how was hoarding disorder, you know, by, by the normal definition, the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "The same.\n",
      "Interviewer (30:26): Very much the same?\n",
      "Participant:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know you said you were retired, but do you still have a household income?\n",
      "You can give me a broad range.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I have two sources of income.\n",
      "I have very minimal social security and I did not have a pension or a retirement fund.\n",
      "I have money invested that the college and I contributed to, and annually I withdraw an amount from that money pot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So all together, could you just give me a broad range of your household income?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "What I'm expecting to withdraw this year is around 40,000.\n",
      "It depends on whether I need to replace my 12-year-old car or the AC goes out or something like that.\n",
      "It might be a bit more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And your geographic region?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I'm in central Texas.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Master's degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "In regards to your $30 gift card, do you have a preference for physical or electronic gift card?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "How would I use an electronic gift card?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I believe it would be for Amazon.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Oh, I use Amazon all the time, so that would be real easy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so electronic is fine?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And we need to collect information for that for the funding, so could you please give me your first and last name?\n",

      "You said D-O-O-K-S 61?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "631\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "631.\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",

      "@GMAIL.COM.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",

      "And a permanent mailing address?\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then is this phone number a good number to reach you at?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "It's my only phone number.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, great.\n",
      "So that's everything that I need for you.\n",
      "Thank you again so much for your participation and your time.\n",
      "We really appreciate it and it will really help us to better understand the knowledge and the attitudes towards this hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So thank you so much.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "You're quite welcome.\n",
      "I'm glad to participate and it's helped me.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",

      "Bye.\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. The last one yet.\n",
      "John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they're valuable.\n",
      "He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.\n",
      "Antiques occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so that he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he is looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "What did you say he collected again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Antique items.\n",
      "Something valuable.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Antiques.\n",
      "I would say it's excessive, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think that this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Probably not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Well, you would hope that you could sit him down and explain, showing him how much money he's wasting and he would be able to accept that he's spending too much money and quit.\n",
      "He might need a psychologist.\n",
      "I don't know about a psychiatrist.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Is this behavior similar or different from yours?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I think it's different.\n",
      "I don't really keep anything thinking I can sell it later.\n",
      "I mean, there might be an occasional like that, but not anything that I collect.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is there anything else that you want to add about your clutter or about how it's affected you?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Again, mine is mostly a problem of not being able to hire somebody to come in and help me clean.\n",
      "I'm not able to health wise to do it myself.\n",
      "Everything is bad because I really can't clean.\n",
      "I can't vacuum floors and bend over to pick up stuff and all that.\n",
      "Mine is mostly a money issue I think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "This is it for the interview questions.\n",
      "I'm going to stop the recording if there's nothing else to add.\n",
      "Give me a second.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, like right now, I'm sitting at my table that I use as a desk and it's covered with papers, my sewing kit, headphones, my music books.\n",
      "If I want to find something, I have to sift through things.\n",
      "My closet has, I mean, literally you have a little pathway to get to the back of the closet.\n",
      "I have stored at either end of... I have a huge closet space that's in the attic and it's stuffed with things now that this...\n",
      "The clothes that I need to get to right away I can get to, but I'm stepping over some shoes or things like that that might be on the floor.\n",
      "And then, my garage, there's a couple of rooms that you can't hardly get into because it's so full of things.\n",
      "The laundry room you can get in and out of but there's stuff stuffed in the corners and things I haven't looked at in years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is-\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "So...\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is everything all in boxes or is it in bags?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Some of it's in boxes, some of it's in water proof boxes, then other things get stuffed because what happens is I have somebody come do some work on the house and I just have to get rid of some things in a hurry so I shove things back into an empty corner.\n",
      "So, there's a mixture of storage boxes, and then in the tool room there's buckets of tools and there's old paint and there's all kinds of stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But you can still access your bathroom and your kitchen?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, my public rooms, people would not think I have a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, the only room that you're maybe not using for it's intended purpose would be the garage, because you don't like park your cars in there, you just use it for storage?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yes, I can park my car in there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, you can?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "I've always been able to park my car in the garage, but the garage... the garage, just beyond the length of the car is there's a bunch of stuff, the left and the right side of the car there's a bunch of stuff stacked up.\n",
      "But I can get the car in the garage, I can get out and get into the house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it's more like you just have a lot of storage spaces but the things that you need to access you can still access?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah, like my car and things, but it's like...\n",
      "I'll say this, it's embarrassing, I can't find the pink slip for my car.\n",
      "It's somewhere.\n",
      "I know I remember getting it, but I don't know where it went, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, that was a place that you could put your stuff where you wouldn't have to see it, so you wouldn't have to feel anxious about going through it?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, but because I also needed the space [inaudible 00:09:18] and had to clear a way, space in my apartment, and then...\n",
      "So, I had that unit for a few years, and then a friend helped me move back into my apartment, but then everything was piled up in containers, and I needed to use some things, so I would wind up having to pull things out, and then the clutter came back.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you had it in the storage unit, and then you realized you needed to move all of it back into your apartment, and at first it was organized in all those containers, but as you started to use the stuff in the containers, it kind of became less and less organized?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I also had to give away quite a few things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What was motivating you to give things away?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "The space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You just didn't have enough space, so you had to get rid of stuff?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I wouldn't have had enough space to have everything all in one place.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Then a few years later, as my parents died, then I wound up having to accumulate all of their belongings.\n",
      "Then I moved everything into storage in their area.\n",
      "We had two units for a few months, and I consolidated everything to one.\n",
      "Then a few years later I moved everything up here to where I live.\n",
      "So, now I have...\n",
      "It's accumulation of my things as well as what my parents had.\n",
      "The only things I consider of value is the old letters and things right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, the most valuable thing that you're saving now is these letters?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes, but then there's still a lot of bulk that's taking up the most space.\n",
      "Some of it I'm trying to find the right place to recycle, like large books.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it sounds like you're in the process of going through all of this stuff, and you're trying to find good homes for it still.\n",
      "You're trying to not just get rid of it, but get rid of it in the right way?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For example, with the large old books, you'd like to recycle them, and then there are other things that are important to you.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, or take them to book places.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "So, then there are other things that are really still important to you, like the letters, and those things you plan to keep?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "What I'm doing with those is I'm digitizing, and then I would like to have them organized and then hand off to another relative.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, those are important to you because they're attached to your family?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Right now, how much of a problem do you think your clutter or your stuff is in your life, right at the moment?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "It's overwhelming.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Now that's a problem too, but I'm not a real box keeper anymore.\n",
      "When I was younger, I was probably like that guy.\n",
      "But I only keep a few boxes for necessity nowadays.\n",
      "But yeah, no, the way you're saying that, that he has to move boxes to go every room, that's a big problem.\n",
      "That's a clutter problem, but if he can't find his keys in 30 minutes, he's going to have to need some help here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, and so I will-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "So, that's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... read the next one, if that's okay too?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, go to the next one.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, John Doe has papers that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future.\n",
      "These papers occupy most of his rooms, except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.\n",
      "Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "So, same question.\n",
      "Do you think John Doe has more of a clutter problem or do you think it's more serious-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "No, he's got a clutter problem.\n",
      "This guy has definitely got... I mean, if you got to move boxes out of your bathtub to take a bath, that's the big clutter problem.\n",
      "I have never put anything in my bathroom, but that's not why I do it.\n",
      "Other than medicines and pills and things you need in the bathroom, towels and soap.\n",
      "But I'm not wanting to bring newspapers into the bathroom and pile them on-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so in this scenario-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "But I've been to places where people do that.\n",
      "I've seen it happen in my lifetime.\n",
      "I've seen piles of newspapers in the bathroom.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So in this scenario, would you say that his behavior is similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Not similar to my own.\n",
      "I don't have that problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Like I just told you I keep my bathrooms clean.\n",
      "They're sort of like a chapel.\n",
      "I don't put anything in there other than what's meant to be in there.\n",
      "And I don't bring books into the bathroom and leave them there, so no, I don't have that problem.\n",
      "But the other guy that you just read, he has that problem.\n",
      "And that's clutter.\n",
      "I see beautiful things and I want them to be around me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it sounds like pottery, and sentimental items, and beautiful things.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "And jewelry, sterling silver jewelry.\n",
      "I used to buy my jewelry primarily at arts and crafts shows or stores.\n",
      "I like handmade things.\n",
      "I like knowing the person who made them and knowing their style and appreciating their style and their work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they were intended to be used?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Say that again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they were intended to be use?\n",
      "For example, some people use their bathtub as storage.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No, that only room is that room I described to you, the bedroom that's totally filled with clothes and book sand stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then the rest of the rooms just have papers on a lot of the surroundings?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Well, my smallest bedroom used to be my study where all my books were, then it became my computer room and I would work from home on my computer a lot at night and on weekends.\n",
      "Right now, it's primarily arts and crafts supplies and furniture for those supplies.\n",
      "And I have a four drawer filing case.\n",
      "I have a folding table behind the door.\n",
      "I have a big steel easel for painting behind the door and then I have stacks of paper and boxes full of paper.\n",
      "There's a stack of magazines to tear pictures out of and a stack of old books that I could do book art in.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Very important.\n",
      "I could never be a person who lived out of hotels, primarily.\n",
      "I could never be a person who changed homes frequently.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I like to be surrounded by the things I like and enjoy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's very important for you to have your objects with you?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what is trash for you?\n",
      "What do you throw away?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "All of the unwanted mail I get.\n",
      "I have a huge bag beside my carport door where I come in with my mail and I immediately get rid of stuff and tear my address off stuff and shred that.\n",
      "What was the question again?\n",
      "What do I consider...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Trash.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Trash?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Primarily paper I don't want and things from cooking and in the kitchen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And this goes back to your most valuable items, so you're jewelry, your pottery, your art supplies, what would happen if you lost those?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Well, I think that immediately I would feel profoundly sad and overwhelmed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. You said that haven't been in your house since that happened, right?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "I've let my daughter in and even gave her a key to my house which was akin to me of standing naked in front of somebody.\n",
      "She had a key to my house because I went to visit my son in the military, in Okinawa for a month, and I needed somebody to feed my parakeet.\n",
      "I really didn't want a stranger coming in to do it, like my next door neighbor because I knew I would be judged and I was horrified of that.\n",
      "My daughter would have opinions, but she wouldn't put me down or holler at me, so she let herself in to feed my birds during that time.\n",
      "She came in once...\n",
      "Because of my health issues the children totally did not let me leave my house during all of the coronavirus thing, so she did my grocery shopping and brought groceries to me.\n",
      "She did not come in my house, but the last time she came she needed to use the bathroom.\n",
      "There's an upstairs bathroom and a downstairs bathroom, but of course the closest bathroom... I was putting together a kitchen island to put in a lot of my kitchen appliances so I could reclaim part of my kitchen counter, and there were pieces, the box, the directions, all scattered over the kitchen floor so she had to walk over it to get into the bathroom.\n",
      "That made me terribly nervous, but she was in, and she said nothing because she knows how painful it is to me to be criticized for something that I'm not sure how to fix.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It seems like your sister's very understanding, does she have children?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "My daughter?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Yes she does.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, do you get to see your grandchildren a lot?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Before the virus, yes, we were together a lot.\n",
      "Her oldest son is autistic, Asperger's, and her youngest daughter is a mini version of my daughter, she's preppy, energetic, outgoing.\n",
      "The two kids are as synchronous as night and day, but I love spending time with them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does she seem to have... you said she understands your behavior.\n",
      "Is her house as cluttered as yours or is she able to keep it under control more.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "I would say that her children's bedrooms look like my living room, they walk over things to get to their beds.\n",
      "Her living room, her kitchen, the bathroom, are always kept immaculate.\n",
      "Her husband is not a hoarder, he is not sentimental.\n",
      "All the cans in the kitchen cupboard have to be labels facing forward, if anything is...\n",
      "The total exact opposite of a hoarder, and his mother is very critical, so she will come through my daughter's house and criticize the things.\n",
      "Kira however, is like me in that, she and I used to love going to garage sales to get little treats for the kids to do things to amuse themselves during the summer, and her husband absolutely despises me because I always bring something whenever I see her children.\n",
      "It could be cookies, it could be a book, it could be a game, it could be something for us to do at that time, but I always bring something.\n",
      "My grandmother did, my mother did, I do, and my daughter kind of does the same thing.\n",
      "He'll tell me, \"Quit bringing things for the kids.\"\n",
      "My daughter and I have established a procedure that we go do our garage saling, and she sneaks things into the house and down into the basement.\n",
      "It's a frightening situation for my grandchildren, because I come and we're playing and we're having a great time, and my daughter will say, \"You're dad's going to be home in half an hour,\" and the kids faces turn into this look of horror, and they start picking up frantically and shoving things under the furniture, moving things to their room because he wants spotless.\n",
      "She understands both sides.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. This next section is going to be talking about distress.\n",
      "Would you say your behavior upsets you?\n",
      "Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "At times, it does.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It upsets me that I can't get rid of things.\n",
      "It can get destructive.\n",
      "It can interfere with being able to do stuff because stuff is in the way and I have to take time to move it around in order to do something else or whatever but the main thing I think is just constantly seeing things cluttered and not being able to do anything about it and just adding more stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Can you think of a time that it ever really got in the way of something you wanted or is it more of a day to day kind of interference?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "It's just a day to day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned previously that your husband has mentioned before like, \"Oh, maybe it's time to get rid of things.\"\n",
      "Has it ever significantly impacted your relationship?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "He kind of knew that you liked to collect the nesting dolls and other things like that from the moment you guys started a relationship?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think it ever affected your work?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. I kept things pretty organized there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, it didn't affect work ... I had a lot of stuff that I should have gotten rid of over the years.\n",
      "Of course, I had to once I'm retiring now but it didn't get in the way.\n",
      "It didn't affect anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Was it ever brought up as a concern with any of your coworkers or anything?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you were growing up, did it ever impact your relationship with your siblings?\n",
      "Did you guys ever fight over stuff?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "That's a long time ago.\n",
      "I suppose here and there we would or if my brothers got irritated and wanted to agitate they'd go in and do something with my collections or something.\n",
      "This, of course, would be very maddening, especially when they broke something.\n",
      "I can't say that we ever really fought over anything because they didn't have the same interests.\n",
      "They didn't care.\n",
      "My sisters and I were far enough apart that it didn't really enter our relationship at all.\n",
      "Usually they enjoyed it too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It was more typical of sibling behavior.\n",
      "Just getting mad and maybe taking someone's stuff but not really impacting it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What about your parents?\n",
      "Did your parents ever get mad about your collections or threaten to take something away?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. I can't say that they ever did.\n",
      "They actually built me bookshelves so I'd have room to put stuff.\n",
      "Sometimes they would encourage whatever it was I was collecting.\n",
      "Some of them were pretty weird but I can't say that they ever were bothered by it.\n",
      "018\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, the first section of the interview, I'd just like to hear from you about your experience with clutter problems.\n",
      "It sounds like it's something that's been going on for a long time for you, so if you could just start by giving me a picture of what life has been like with these problems, when they started and how long they've been going on?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I started noticing 20 years ago when I had too much things that I did not want to look at again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, the first time you really realized that you had problems was about 20 years ago, and you noticed because you had so much stuff that you didn't want to see again.\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Because I didn't want to deal with organizing it, figuring out what to keep, what to throw away, and how to use it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "So, that was when you started to feel that the behavior was a problem for you, because you really didn't want to be confronted with all of these things and the task of organizing them.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How long had you been saving things at that point?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, the 20 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you noticed it was a problem 20 years ago, but the problem had kind of been going on for about 20 years before that?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How bad was the behavior when you started to feel that it became a problem?\n",
      "Would you say it was a very severe problem in your life?\n",
      "Would you feel that it was in the way of your daily life, or do you feel like it was a minor problem?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Oh, man.\n",
      "At that point it was just kind of in the way, but it didn't detract from anything I was doing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it was there, but it wasn't really interfering in your life?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "It's just that it was the sense of doom for the future.\n",
      "It was more a...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Anxiety.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... anxiety for the future, because in the future I'm going to have to deal with all of this stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you were aware of it as a problem, and mostly, it caused problems because it made you anxious to think about the prospect of having to deal with it?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What happened next?\n",
      "How did you respond?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I wound up renting storage.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "That was about when I started renting storage unit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All righty.\n",
      "So this next part of the interview is going to be more conversation style and it's kind of separated it into a few different topics.\n",
      "So this first one is going to be behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "Can you please describe your clutter problems and how long they've been going on?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I guess almost as long as I can remember, honestly.\n",
      "I'm 54 and I can remember even as a kid having a messy room, having a lot of stuff around.\n",
      "Not necessarily good stuff but just yeah.\n",
      "So I think pretty much a long time.\n",
      "What was the question?\n",
      "What was the rest?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It was just can you describe I guess your problem and how severe?\n",
      "Would you say your behavior is severe now?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I don't think it's severe.\n",
      "I've never been at the severe point where you see a lot of those crazy TV shows.\n",
      "I've never been like that, but I've always had, depending on what house I lived in, a full basement, a full attic.\n",
      "A room that I always call a junk room in my house with just stuff.\n",
      "I mean the main living areas of my house have always been fine, clean, and uncluttered, and livable, and entertain often.\n",
      "But I've always had a part that's full of stuff.\n",
      "I've literally carted around the same stuff for decades where I'm moving.\n",
      "Honestly now, the last few years, I've tried to really by myself basically get a handle on it and tried to start really and truly making an effort to get rid of stuff.\n",
      "Just for example, I do flea markets and antique festivals and things like that.\n",
      "This last few months with the pandemic that I've been home, I've always done stuff on eBay, but I've been crazy with eBay the last few months because I guess a lot of people are shopping at home.\n",
      "I send out several packages a day and I'm finally getting through my basement.\n",
      "I just have so much stuff.\n",
      "It's almost like spitting in the ocean because I've got a lot of stuff and sending out a few things here and there.\n",
      "But at least I feel like I'm moving in a direction and I'm really trying.\n",
      "I'm part of a neighborhood forum, so if somebody posts they need something, I'll be like, oh, I have it, I'll bring it to you.\n",
      "I guess other than stuff that's really special and sentimental to me, regular stuff, I'm at the point where if I can't use it and I don't need it, I am happy to get rid of it.\n",
      "I don't want to throw it away and see it go in a landfill, but if I can find homes for things.\n",
      "So I think I'm getting better.\n",
      "One thing is too, I really don't buy anything.\n",
      "Now I've had a comfortable lifestyle, so I can have anything I want, basically, not really.\n",
      "But you know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So for all the things that might contribute to development of clutter difficulties, I have emotional attachment.\n",
      "Think you'll need it in the future.\n",
      "You just might like the items and how size contributes to it.\n",
      "Would you like to add anything else?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No, I think those are the main ones.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So the next question is, can you please list all the reasons that you keep things?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Well, kind of the same, somebody gave it to you or you like it or you think you'll use it.\n",
      "I don't know or it could look nice if it's a vase or a something it's just special to you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So all the reasons that you keep things we have, it was gifted to you, you might just like it, it has a future use it looks nice or might have a special meaning to it.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you like to add anything else the reason that you keep things.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No. Mm-mm (negative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So the next one is, can you please list all the ways that a person could identify someone with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I would say they have a messy house.\n",
      "I think of someone with a hoarding disorder that is unkept themselves, unbathed.\n",
      "I guess, outside their property usually would be messy too.\n",
      "To me it's just a lot of stuff around.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So for all the ways that a person could identify someone with hoarding disorder, I have a messy house, they lack personal hygiene maybe, their property is messy and they might just keep a lot of things.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you like to add anything else on that list?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No. Mm-mm (negative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "And this is going to be our last one.\n",
      "So if you can please list all the reasons that people might want to seek treatment for their difficulties with clutter.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I think if it's gotten so difficult that they can't move around their house freely.\n",
      "They would want to seek help.\n",
      "Or if they're criticized by someone about their mess then they would want to seek help.\n",
      "And family members probably would step in for the person to seek help, which they may or may not agree to.\n",
      "But I think the main thing is that it has become a problem to get to stuff because other stuff is in the way, basically.\n",
      "008\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Great.\n",
      "Okay, so now we're going to transition into the second part.\n",
      "I'm just going to ask you some questions.\n",
      "You don't have to do the listing anymore.\n",
      "It's just going to be kind of conversational.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so can you please describe your hoarding specifically?\n",
      "How long has this been going on for you?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I would say really high school and college.\n",
      "I have a really hard time getting rid of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "High school and college.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how old are you now, if you don't mind me asking?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "46. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so this has gone on for awhile, right?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How severe is this now for you?\n",
      "Has it increased steadily as you've gotten older?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "No, if anything it's probably a little better, but pretty mild I would say.\n",
      "So, like on a scale of one to 10, it's probably a three.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "It's not like the house is overrun with stuff or anything like that.\n",
      "It's just very hard for me to get rid of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Is there something that sparked it, maybe your initial acquiring of items in college and high school?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I can't think of anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just started kind of collecting more and more things, or you were always kind of a collector?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Always kind of a collector.\n",
      "I guess the way that I manage it is I just don't get much stuff, cause it is so hard to get rid of it once I have it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And why is it tough to get rid of it for you?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Some of the stuff that's hardest to get rid of is if it was given to me by somebody else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "There's some sense that I shouldn't just throw it away because of that, or there will be some projects that I've never finish that it's very difficult to get rid of because I feel guilty that I never finished it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "And I probably never will.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It seems like you have some insight, though.\n",
      "I mean, knowing that you have projects that you'll never finish, or knowing.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I was thinking about it, even this week, I threw out a box of stuff that was related to a research project that I had done when I was an undergrad.\n",
      "I think the trash just came through today, but I threw it out on Monday.\n",
      "Every day I was thinking about it sitting in the trash, feeling bad about throwing it out, never finished the project, and I've been carrying it around for probably almost 25 years now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does your behavior upset you?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how was the group setting?\n",
      "How did you find that?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Probably, but I'm also an emotional eater, so I just go open the refrigerator or the pantry door and I eat that feeling and cover it up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And could you describe a time when your problems with clutter got in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Up until the pandemic, I would have loved for neighbors that I'm close to to be able to come over to my house, sit around and have tea, or just sit and visit and chat, and I'm too embarrassed to do that.\n",
      "Of course with the pandemic, I can't, but...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So that socialization is something that you would [crosstalk 00:43:28]\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "And need, I mean every person needs social experiences.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And has it ever impacted any of your romantic or familial relationships?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Because I haven't had a romantic relationship in some years.\n",
      "I gave up on having relationships with men.\n",
      "Did you say family?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "And I only have a brother.\n",
      "My family is initially from Alabama and all of my relatives who still live in Alabama or Georgia are racist and I choose not to be in touch with them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good for you.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "So my brother is the only family member and he lives in Kentucky and I'm in the middle of Texas.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What are the main reasons why you would like to change your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I would be happier when I have a social life and can invite people into my home and enjoy people seeing what I have, not coming in and admiring it, but not worrying about someone coming into my home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, you just don't want that worry or anxiety or embarrassment anymore.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No. My definition of who I am doesn't include how I've been living in recent years, so there's a disconnect between who I think I am and who I actually am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you're experiencing some of that cognitive dissonance, where your expectations of your reality aren't matching up.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well thank you, that was all the questions I had for you, and now I just need to collect some demographic information.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your race?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "White, Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic and/or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, I feel that.\n",
      "And then when I get to friends of mine, I'm a little ill at ease.\n",
      "I'm afraid to hug people or handshake or do things I used to do because I do have an immune system that's not very smart.\n",
      "So, therefore, I have to be very careful of what I do out in public anymore.\n",
      "So it's been a downside for me in many ways.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "How has COVID affected your habits?\n",
      "So have you found yourself buying more things during COVID or do you have difficulties with [crosstalk 01:11:01]\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I'd say I'm buying less things on COVID.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You're buying less things.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm getting rid of more things and not buying any other than paper goods like everybody else does.\n",
      "Soap and bleach and things like that which I may be buying more of because of the fear that they're going to run out again.\n",
      "But other than that, I'm not buying any more foods.\n",
      "I'm not packing my freezer full of steaks.\n",
      "No, I'm just doing like I did previously.\n",
      "I mean, I'm not one of those guys who hoard food to a certain extent.\n",
      "I have a freezer but I don't put in 10 years' worth of food in there.\n",
      "So I haven't changed my eating habits because of COVID no, and I'm not hoarding food any more than I was before COVID.\n",
      "I just find it's harder now to get some of the foods that I used to eat pretty easy.\n",
      "Now I have to find them.\n",
      "I have to go around and find certain foods that I...\n",
      "They're getting harder to find some of the things I like.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "It's very difficult, very difficult.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "How has COVID affected you financially?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "It's actually hurt me financially.\n",
      "My stocks and bonds have gone way down and some of my foreign investments have gone upside down.\n",
      "Some of my investments, including some of my collections, have lost their value so it's definitely affected me.\n",
      "But I'm well to do so it's not going to make any difference in the long run because I have trust funds and family gets everything.\n",
      "So it's not that I'm going to go broke or anything.\n",
      "It's just that we'll see if we rebound from this.\n",
      "This is going to be interesting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How about your physical health, any impact on that?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Probably not.\n",
      "As a side effect, in the middle of COVID?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, no way.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "No, probably relationship between the two, other than strange being in a hospital this time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know, right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:55:22].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, just for something completely different.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Going through the test, and yeah.\n",
      "Isolation and being in the hospital that's almost empty, because you're in the non COVID part, and ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "How about your ...\n",
      "Oh, go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Being [inaudible 00:55:45] they're very eager to push you through too.\n",
      "Like, I probably didn't want to have the appendectomy.\n",
      "What's the other options?\n",
      "But it's pretty much, no, you don't want to sit in the hospital right now.\n",
      "We need to get you out of here.\n",
      "So, we're just going to take you out and send you on your way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, I mean, got to love faster service, right?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I suppose.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what about your financial health, I guess you could call it?\n",
      "Has it affected ...\n",
      "Has COVID affected your family financially?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "Not significantly.\n",
      "We're probably spending a little less money.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "That's nice.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Not going out to eat.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And then, how about your overall mental health?\n",
      "You said the social aspect, has that made you feel more isolated?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, probably a little bit.\n",
      "Yeah, I had to stop reading the news, but it's probably like a second order with COVID cause it seems like things have gotten a little more intense, of course, politics and everything else.\n",
      "So, that was getting to be too much to try to ...\n",
      "Just useless stress, I guess ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative) Yeah, definitely watching the news.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "... Is the other way to describe that.\n",
      "But if anything, I'm kind of trying to almost be more isolated cause it seems like everything else has gotten crazier.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I mean, yeah, you can get lost in the news, and kind of ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, there's riots, and protests, and ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And yeah, be more anxious.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "... Fired up about politics.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Don't want to hear about it anymore, now that I brought it up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, how do you cope during this time?\n",
      "It seems like you were watching the news, and now you're not, and you're just kind of trying to avoid that because it was eliciting some emotions that you didn't want to deal with.\n",
      "Yeah, how else do you cope?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, so that's probably pretty well captured, as far as coping with it and doing sort of online stuff with friends I wouldn't be doing otherwise.\n",
      "Then watching more ...\n",
      "We don't actually have a TV, but I have started watching more podcasts.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "That sort of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I guess.\n",
      "Staying home more.\n",
      "So ...\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "The chest beside the sofa is covered with stacks of books.\n",
      "I have one of those little tables that folds that people eat on.\n",
      "I forget what they're called.\n",
      "That's covered in books and journals and papers.\n",
      "And a chair in the corner has a big plastic box of art supplies, and on top of that is a pad of drawing paper, and on top of that is a cushy ottoman, and on top of that is a queen sized quilt that I need to have cleaned but I don't feel safe going to a laundromat, and on top of that are some papers and a winter jacket I washed that should be put in the closet where my winter coats are.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sounds like a lot.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "There's another table thing that has a bunch of magazines on the top, tchotchkes and stuff.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So going back to what you said, you said that you assigned one of your bedrooms that are supposed to be disposed of or given away.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why do you think you haven't be able to bring yourself to bring those items out since you've already separated them from the rest?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Well, actually a big part of it is the pandemic.\n",
      "Because the clothes I had planned to take to a consignment store or just give to a thrift store.\n",
      "Those are nice, expensive clothes, just pass them on.\n",
      "I don't have trouble of letting go of things, generally, but those places are closed, now, and I don't want to just take this stuff to Goodwill.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "The books I had planned to sell at Half Price Books, the largest one in Austin, Texas is about two miles from me, and they have recently reopened, but I don't feel safe.\n",
      "The place where they buy back books is in the back of a huge store that used to be a grocery store.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "So even with gloves and a mask, I don't feel safe in that space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so the pandemic has really hindered your ability to get rid of your items?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "I would have...\n",
      "Like I said, I can get rid of stuff, but I feel stalled right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever gone to a professional for help with this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No, I've gone to therapy off and on since I was in my mid thirties.\n",
      "I have dealt with family issues, boyfriend issues, and just down to my basic emotions that I deal with.\n",
      "I still talk to a therapist by Zoom.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, but nothing about your problems with organization?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And why do you think you haven't done that?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Because I didn't identify that as a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "And now I'm on the landline.\n",
      "Let me switch telephones.\n",
      "Let me try this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, that's fine.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Hi. Participant 011:\n",
      "Here, let me see here.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Switching phones.\n",
      "Can you hear me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Actually this is a much better phone.\n",
      "I was just charging it up.\n",
      "I can actually hear you clear.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I have to let the dog go out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Otherwise he may do something in the house that he's not meant to do.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Go on here.\n",
      "I'm sorry, I have a little interruption.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No it's fine.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "But no, this house is not cluttered yet.\n",
      "but knowing me, it's going to get cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "At this point in my life, the only valuable possessions I have are sentimental things like photo albums and movies and videos.\n",
      "Those types of things that are really hard to get rid of because they're sentimental.\n",
      "And other than that, the other types of things that I find, some paintings that I've bought over the period of time are hard to get rid of because I bought the paintings and they were good paintings and the value has gone way up.\n",
      "And I like good art, all kinds of good art.\n",
      "So those types of things are a little hard to get rid of.\n",
      "I mean, I'd have to auction them off and have appraisals, which I'm doing by the way, at this point in my life, I'm putting things aside for some parts of my family and giving things like that.\n",
      "But yeah, my art is very difficult for me to get rid of because I have, yeah.\n",
      "So I would say my most difficult thing to get rid of is the art that I've accumulated.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So would you say that's the most precious item in your house?\n",
      "Is your art?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Obviously the art is the most.\n",
      "And also creative things that I've either bought or people have given me, those kinds of things are really hard to get rid of, like I mentioned earlier.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Because not just sentimental reasons, but because I have attachments to them, unfortunately.\n",
      "I'm attached to this and attached to that.\n",
      "So maybe they had to tie me down, but I've always loved good art.\n",
      "So yeah.\n",
      "Getting rid of the good stuff will be the most difficult thing to get rid of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it sounds like you'd choose based on use?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Would I be using this again, and I have this habit of wanting to take care of other people so it's like, \"Oh, well this costume's cool.\n",
      "It doesn't fit me but it might fit somebody who's over visiting and we might want to do something where we dress up so I can loan it to them.\"\n",
      "So, it's like do I really need to take care of everybody else's costume needs or whatever?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, when you think about how long this has been going on and stuff, you mentioned that you're starting to feel claustrophobic, does it upset you a lot and do you think it get in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "It doesn't upset me a lot, but I've noticed that I'm feeling this weight.\n",
      "I have... it's just this low level dread or weight about having to deal with this, so it's not in the forefront in my mind, it's just in the background.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you said you recently started feeling like this?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "It's been going on for a while where I'm feeling like I needed to start dealing with it, like for I'd say a couple years or so.\n",
      "It might've been sparked with seeing my mother get sicker and realizing that there was a lot of stuff in her house, and my sister's and I starting to try to clean some of that out.\n",
      "This is funny, I just thought of this, she kept things too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh. Participant 009:\n",
      "So, I mean, she got really upset with me because we threw away a bunch of...\n",
      "She had canned a bunch of fruits and vegetables and these things were 10 years old and unsafe to eat and my sister and I threw it all out and she got really upset with us.\n",
      "I'm thinking, you know, that was totally an emotional attachment on her part.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, your mom kept a lot of things, did she just keep food items or was it a lot of clothes?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "She had quite a few clothes, but not too much.\n",
      "I mean, she'd keep an old towel that would be pretty raggedy.\n",
      "She was a child in the depression so it was really hard for her to feel like she had enough because she grew up pretty poor and it was like you had to really make do, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But your father didn't do that?\n",
      "He was very-\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No. No, my dad...\n",
      "As soon as my mom died, I mean as soon as she died, he was moving into an independent living place and we went back to help and he was like, \"Get rid of this, get rid of that, get this other thing.\n",
      "Go, go, go,\" and he just moved just what he had needed.\n",
      "He's got no problem with that at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It's very, like, contrasting views.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, I'm going to read you the next one and we're going to kind of go through the same questions.\n",
      "So, this one is John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decided to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He's worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "His house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for him to walk in his house.\n",
      "Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "So, do you think this person has hoarding disorder or is the behavior more like clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "He's definitely got a hoarding problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Should this person try to change the behavior, and why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It's impacting his life in a pretty negative way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How is this one similar or different from your own behavior?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, I don't have any problem doing things I need to do so it's very different as far as that goes.\n",
      "I'm never later for anything.\n",
      "I'm usually early, and it's like I don't have to move things to get in another room or anything like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right, and there's two more, so we're on our third one.\n",
      "So, this next one is John Doe has a lot of craft items that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future.\n",
      "Crafting supplies occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.\n",
      "Sometimes, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10, 20, minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "So, for this one, do you think he-\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:42:52].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh. Participant 009:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It's the same question so if you already know you can answer.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Oh. Yeah, I would say he definitely has a hoarding problem and would need to get help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, and you think it would require treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. And for this next scenario, John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.\n",
      "He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.\n",
      "Antiques occupy every room, and before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "So once again, do you believe John=\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, Mr. John Doe needs to open an antique shop immediately.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "And move it all out of his house and move it into the store and hire someone to sell it for him.\n",
      "Yeah, that's the same kind of problem.\n",
      "Again, like I told you, there's the differentiation between a collector and a hoarder.\n",
      "And if people start hoarding their antiques in their...\n",
      "Yeah, I know people do that too, and I had an aunt who actually...\n",
      "She had wonderful collections of certain types of antiques, but she was probably a hoarder, and even though she kept them in two or three different rooms.\n",
      "But I was wondering, maybe I inherited some of that.\n",
      "But the antique story's same as the previous one, to tell you the truth.\n",
      "It's a clutter problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay.\n",
      "And so for this last part of the interview, we're going to be talking about COVID, and again, I will ask-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So I will, again, ask you some questions and just let me know if you need any clarification or you feel uncomfortable answering any of the questions.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, how has COVID impacted your life such as...\n",
      "What specific behaviors have changed for you?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "COVID has affected my...\n",
      "PART 3 OF 4 ENDS [01:09:04]\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "COVID has affected my life.\n",
      "It's more distance from socializing with people that I've previously socialized with an organization.\n",
      "I was a volunteer.\n",
      "Some of my volunteer jobs, I'm no longer a volunteer doing.\n",
      "Consequently, I'm more alone now than I was previously.\n",
      "The positive side of COVID is I've reached out to my family a little more so than I have in the past and I'm communicating with them more so that's a plus side.\n",
      "But the downside is yeah, I'm less in contact with people around me in my vicinity where I live so it's not healthful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, what are you collections that make of most of the stuff that you have in storage?\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "Is it a lot of photos, a lot of books, or...\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "In storage or collections, because I actually have... I collect things that I display.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:23:19].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, yeah, let's hear about both.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Such as I have a collection of egg cups and I've limited myself by the display space I have in the kitchen.\n",
      "So, I have egg cups, I have elephants that I've collected over the years, all these figurines of elephants that are on display.\n",
      "I have art and things like that that's displayed around the house in different places, so that's what I consider a collection.\n",
      "Did that answer your question?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, then what is in all the boxes that you have in your garage?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Oh, the boxes?\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Art supplies, extra dishes, stuff for doing rituals because I do seasonal rituals with a spiritual group, costumes, loads of scarfs.\n",
      "I've got collections, well I did say art supplies, right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Craft supplies, things for when I used to do theater, so music, and I mean sheet music but also CDs and things like that, and then some electronics that support that that are probably way out of date like CD players and recorders for when I would record myself singing for classes and things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, when you think about all of these items that you have, how would you choose between them if you had to get rid of something?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I would probably go through and which ritual objects do I still use, well, and of course right now all of that's in advance because of Covid, go through my sheet music and those kind of songs I don't do anymore, give this to somebody, go through the old electronics and just dump all of that because now with GarageBand and all of that I don't use that stuff anymore.\n",
      "And then definitely I need to go through all those boxes of pictures and throw away things that I don't want to keep and scan anything that I think is an image I'd like to look at again, and I don't need to keep both a scan and a photo if I'm not going to frame it or something, so.\n",
      "And the costumes, probably the costumes I should go through and call there and pull out things that I'm not going to wear again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay.\n",
      "And is there any particular source where you get your information about hoarding disorder, if you do at all?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Oh, there's hoarding shows on TV and the news when they...\n",
      "I'm a vet, so I notice when they take animals out of hoarding situations.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Hm. How do you feel about the hoarding television shows?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Well, they're helping people.\n",
      "They're trying to help them so I think that's a good thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "I think about somebody who's got too much stuff and they can't function well because of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And does your behavior upset you?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Could you think of a time when it got in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "And would you like to change it?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "I'd just really like to have the time to sort through everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), so if you-\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Which I don't, since I'm still working full-time, so I don't.\n",
      "But I don't really want to change myself, I just want to be able to go through everything and try to get rid of stuff that has no use or sentimental value.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So if you did have the time, you would want to sort through and discard?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "In fact, when my husband gets to a box that belongs to the kids, he lets me sort that, but then I sort them and rather than throwing much away, I put for each child who's now an adult, I have a box to go to them to next time we see them, they're going to get some of their childhood belongings.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And finally, has it ever impacted any familial or romantic relationships or your work?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "No, I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That was all the questions I had for you.\n",
      "So now I just need to collect demographic information.\n",
      "So your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your race?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic and or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "A yearly household income?\n",
      "You can just give me a range.\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "So between 125 and 175,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your geographic region?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Michigan.\n",
      "Ingham County, Okemos, Michigan.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Professional school.\n",
      "Post grad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And concerning the $30 gift card, do you have a preference for it to be physical or electronic?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "I like physical cards coming in the mail.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. What would happen if you-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I have no problem getting rid of good furniture though.\n",
      "I mean, expensive furniture.\n",
      "I can get rid of any day of the week.\n",
      "I can sell it.\n",
      "So yeah, a lot of things that people made for me and things like that, like the art stuff that people made for me, that stuff is hard to get rid of.\n",
      "That's the most difficult stuff I can get rid of is stuff that people have made for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So what would happen if you somehow lost some of that stuff?\n",
      "Like how would you feel about that?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "So we're almost about ready to lose it now, there's fires all around my house and oh my God, it's so cloudy out.\n",
      "I mean, smoky and I had no idea.\n",
      "I mean we're on number two alert here already because the whole western...\n",
      "PART 2 OF 4 ENDS [00:46:04]\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "We're on number two alert here already because the whole Western United States is burning up if you haven't read.\n",
      "How do I feel about it?\n",
      "I think I should probably be taking all the paintings off the wall and putting them in a suitcase right now, but [inaudible 00:46:19] until somebody in my family calls me and tells me I should do it.\n",
      "So how do I feel about that?\n",
      "Yeah, I feel awful about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "But if the fire came and burned my house down here or my two houses that I have, I would lose everything.\n",
      "I guess be like those people in Paradise who lost everything last year or year before last.\n",
      "But you start up from ashes again, you grab what you can that's [inaudible 00:46:59] the living things, which are more important, and probably a couple of most rare paintings, and hope the rest of the stuff the insurance company will give you some money for.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I mean, that's why we got home insurance, right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "They never pay you what you think you're going to get from them though.\n",
      "I know that.\n",
      "But you can't insure everything.\n",
      "You can only insure your house up to a certain point.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "So yeah, no, I feel horrible about that, but in a way I'd probably feel relief too.\n",
      "So, it goes both ways.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I mean, I'm not going to burn my house down, or if there's a catastrophe here and I'm evacuated and my house does burn down, well, it'll be sad, but I will recover from it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "When it comes to throwing things out, how do you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Or what do you discard?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right.\n",
      "Do you think you have too much stuff at the moment?\n",
      "How do you know when you have too much?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No more room.\n",
      "Stuff put away in boxes that you never even look at because there's so much stuff.\n",
      "Why have it if you don't have it out and enjoying it?\n",
      "You get to that point and there's just plain no more place to put stuff.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You're kind of limited by your physical dimensions of your house?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you moved into a bigger house, you would just ...\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Oh, man.\n",
      "Means more stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Actually we're at the point now where we're going to decrease in size and I have to face the reality of what do I do?\n",
      "What do I get rid of?\n",
      "What do I keep?\n",
      "That's going to be a big challenge in the next year or so?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Kind of going off of that, if you have to choose between items, how do you choose?\n",
      "How are you going to make that decision?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I don't know yet.\n",
      "That's what I'm trying to figure out.\n",
      "I'm trying to go through.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "We just went through it with my mom and it was so hard for us even to handle getting rid of her stuff and my father's stuff.\n",
      "Now that's all added in here.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I have no idea how I'm going to do it.\n",
      "I really don't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Were you able to get rid of anything when you were going through their items?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "The things that just were falling apart and stuff.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There were things that nobody wanted of my parents.\n",
      "Those we did get rid of.\n",
      "The things that were sentimental to us all, those we all kept.\n",
      "Even if they were in bad condition.\n",
      "I'm talking about my siblings.\n",
      "We just added it to our piles.\n",
      "I have my piles.\n",
      "They have theirs.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do your siblings collect as much as you do?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. One of them does.\n",
      "The rest don't.\n",
      "No. My baby sister and I both have issues with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Did your parents collect a lot also?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So did our grandparents.\n",
      "It's genetic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You'd say a lot of your family members then [crosstalk 00:29:31].\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, I mean, not of my siblings but, yes, generational.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "010\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Did you want something from me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. I'm just starting the recording now and it should be recording.\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "Okay, so first let's start with some demographics.\n",
      "Some basic things.\n",
      "What's your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And your sex assigned at birth?\n",

      "Your race?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Ethnicity?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "None.\n",
      "I mean white.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Graduated high school.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your household income?\n",
      "This can be a range.\n",
      "It doesn't have to be an exact amount.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "About $25,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your geographic region?\n",
      "Like northeast?\n",
      "South?\n",
      "West?\n",
      "Midwest?\n",
      "Non-continental?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I would say southeast.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Southeast?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "As you know, this study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "I'm going to refer to a certain term referring to hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Do you have any specific term that you want me to use?\n",
      "Such as organization anxieties?\n",

      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Just hoarding is fine?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "That's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "That's the first section done.\n",
      "Now, the second section is going to be a little bit more casual.\n",
      "It's not going to be as listing as this one was.\n",
      "So, we can start with can you please describe your hoarding or not hoarding, as you said?\n",
      "How long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I've always collected stuff and I've always been lazy.\n",
      "I was like that my whole life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do you think your behavior is severe now?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Repeat that one?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How severe would you say this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Not severe.\n",
      "My biggest problem is cleaning up the house.\n",
      "If I had enough money to hire a maid, I wouldn't have a problem at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you don't think that your behavior is a problem at all?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "My sloppy behavior is probably a problem.\n",
      "As far as hoarding things?\n",
      "No, that's not a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever thought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever gone to a professional for help with clutter?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I just never thought that was ... I wouldn't spare the money.\n",
      "Number one, I never thought it was enough of a problem to warrant getting anything like that.\n",
      "I mean, enough that you would tell a psychiatrist that would help him help you get over it.\n",
      "Except the fact that you're lazy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So all the reasons that someone might want to seek treatment would be they can't move around their house.\n",
      "They're criticized about their mess, family pressures, and maybe they can't locate certain items because there's just too much stuff around.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I guess also to add to it would be that something begins not working, a sink, or a toilet, or something.\n",
      "So the house becomes unfunctional in a lot of ways and that forces them to seek help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So for the complete list so far, I have, they can't move around their house, they're criticized about their mess, they have pressures from their family.\n",
      "They can't find stuff and then their house might be home on functional, things might break and then they're not able to fix them.\n",
      "Would you like to anything else?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So that completes the free listing portion of the interview.\n",
      "And the next section is kind of more conversation style, and it's just broken into a few different topics.\n",
      "So this first one is going to be behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "So can you please describe your clutter problems and how long they've been going on.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "From me?\n",
      "I would say...\n",
      "We moved here 22 years ago, so maybe 20 years ago it began to get easy just to settle in and not have to throw things away so much.\n",
      "And I wouldn't say it's a horrible problem for me, but I do keep more than what I really probably ought to and what else?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you said it started about 20-ish years ago.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Yeah, I would say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there any specific reason why you think it started or you just got settled in a permanent home?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Yeah, I think that was it.\n",
      "Prior to that we had moved a number of times and we had smaller houses than we do now.\n",
      "And so with moving and not having the space, I think you tend to just get rid of things as you have to.\n",
      "Although there's things that I've...\n",
      "My youngest child is now 26 and for all those years I've had the crib for instance.\n",
      "And I finally just turned it into...\n",
      "Got rid of the mattress and put the frame up for some shelving down the basement for toys for the grandkids.\n",
      "So that was something that I probably could have gotten rid of what 24 years ago, but I didn't, and I don't know why I didn't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you have any problems when you were a child at all, growing up?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No. I would say I had a happy childhood.\n",
      "My mom stayed at home.\n",
      "My dad worked kind of a traditional style.\n",
      "I was the oldest of five and I think we had enough food and good shelter and stability.\n",
      "I don't know maybe because I was the oldest of five and afraid that my brothers and sisters were going to take my stuff, maybe that's what kind of plays into it, I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. So, I'm going to read you another scenario-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "[crosstalk 01:01:54] I remember where I put things down.\n",
      "But not always.\n",
      "Once you get over 80 years old, you don't always remember where you put things down because your mind, may be somewhere else when you're doing it.\n",
      "But it's not a big problem.\n",
      "And I would say John DOE, if he has that problem, he should take care of that and go seek help depending upon what...\n",
      "If it's just putting boxes that he bought things in, and then cluttering up the garage, that could be a problem too.\n",
      "But like I told you, if it's just the television box, okay, leave it there because it may break.\n",
      "Or if it's another box, something you may have to return, yeah.\n",
      "Normal people keep those things because nowadays everything breaks within a few years.\n",
      "So [crosstalk 01:02:47] way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I'm going to go ahead and read you another scenario.\n",
      "Is that okay with you?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, read me another...\n",
      "I'm probably going to look too far into these scenarios you're reading me, and therefore, being a good rationalist, I'll be able to figure it out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in, yet he's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "So again, do you believe Mr. Doe has more serious hoarding disorder behavior or is it more of a clutter problem, and why?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "No, no. He's got more serious problems than just clutter.\n",
      "But yeah, boxes in every room, that's a bad sign.\n",
      "My bad habit is putting smaller boxes into larger boxes and smaller boxes into the smaller boxes, so I've got 10 boxes, all different sizes, all in one box.\n",
      "And so of course I need the box in the middle.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. The newer photographs you think you can get rid of after you digitize them, but the older photographs you're going to continue to hang onto?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Once I've digitized them, once they're organized, then I would intend to find a niece or nephew to hand them off to, if they'll take them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "So, you kind of plan to treat those, that organized collection, as an heirloom?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Those are so important to you because they're linked to memories from your family, or-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, yes, and also, the antique value for the things that are 100 years old.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, things that are older, you mean antique value in the sense of money value or sentimental value?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "It's kind of a combination of both.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "So, other than the letters that you mentioned, and the photographs, and again, please correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like the most important things that you own are all kind of older things that are linked to your family, linked to memories from your family, and also, just kind of objectively old and perhaps valuable.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Again, this is just hypothetical, but what do you think would happen if those things were lost?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I did wind up losing a lot of things recently, things of value, although they weren't necessarily the antique ones.\n",
      "Well, if it was digitized, then I would be kind of okay because, well, at least I've got the information.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But if they weren't digitized and you had lost them, you would be-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Then I'd just be anxious.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It would make you anxious?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "For a while, I was afraid I had lost some film.\n",
      "It's possible that I did, but...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you had lost-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... I'm at least trying to gather what I can for family history.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "So, if you had lost them before you digitized them, it would make you anxious that that part of your family history was lost?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you would feel regret that you were unable to preserve those parts of your family's memory?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Or something that could be of value, at least for me or someone else, and that has happened quite a bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, of value-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "But I'd still wind up just dealing with it, letting it go anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you've learned to kind of deal a little bit with that loss, but you still worry about-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, because-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... there's still going to be things that are going to...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Be lost.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... going to be lost like that.\n",
      "So, I would just have to let go.\n",
      "But I was just thinking about that the other day actually because I came across a box and I was like, I really should just recycle all this stuff.\n",
      "So work was funny, but like I said, most of my colleagues, they never went in my back storage room, but they were all bad.\n",
      "Everybody in schools is like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Piles of papers, piles of books.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "But I'm sure it was messier than my principal would've liked a lot of times.\n",
      "I'd be like, oh, no, I'm having an evaluation, I got to get rid of some of this stuff.\n",
      "It's just I'm just messy.\n",
      "I'm just unorganized.\n",
      "It definitely gets in the way when you're trying to, oh, where's my lesson plans?\n",
      "Just trying to find things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I think that actually covered all my questions.\n",
      "I think you answered some of them without even me having to ask.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Oh, I definitely have the gift of gab too.\n",
      "It seems to be extreme.\n",
      "I was a journalist before I became a teacher, so I always used to you know-\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like, when you think about your ideal living space and what would be comfortable for you to live in, do you feel like having all of your items with you will make you more comfortable in that space?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Which of the things that you...\n",
      "When you think about all of the stuff, what sorts of items do you think are the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, the older letters and photos.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, older items that are linked to your family's history, it sounds like those are the most important ones.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What are the things that you spend the most time with?\n",
      "So, when you're at home, which items do you tend to use or take out or look at the most?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I've been taking out the family items and digitizing, occasionally posting something, and then I'm also going through some discs and things to digitize that I don't need to keep the original of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you're kind of working through the process of putting all of the most important things, getting a digital form of them, and then some of those things you don't need to save the original because you have a digital copy?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right, things that are new that aren't valuable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, once you've digitized new things, you can discard them?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You've talked several times about the fact that things get cluttered.\n",
      "I guess I'm wondering, do you feel that your space is cluttered now?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What makes a space cluttered for you?\n",
      "When you say that something is cluttered, does that mean that the items are out?\n",
      "What distinguishes clutter?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I'll kind of stack up toward the door, and there isn't really...\n",
      "There are things on the floor, so there isn't space to vacuum or anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, that sense of things being stacked up and preventing you from being able to vacuum the floor is what makes clutter clutter?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, there's things on the floor...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, things on the floor, things that are not organized?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... that block the path a little bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, things that are starting to block the path in and out of the door, that's cluttering?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there parts of your apartment that you're not able to use or have access to?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "No. I have access to the bathroom and kitchen and bed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you're able to sleep in your bed and use your bathroom and shower, and use the kitchen without the clutter getting in the way?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So this next section is distinguished about talking about hoarding disorder itself and how people view it.\n",
      "So what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I think collecting has an order to it and a space for it.\n",
      "Like if you're collecting shells or something, you would have them all in one area and a designated place to work on your project.\n",
      "Whereas hoarding is pretty haphazard and there's no particular place for what you've got and you probably can't find it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you say hoarding disorder looks like and how is it the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I think hoarding is worse than I have because if I put my mind to it, I can clean up.\n",
      "Even though sometimes I have a hard time getting rid of things, I think hoarders can't get rid of anything and in particular garbage, that is all over houses.\n",
      "Whereas I think of my house as clean, but cluttered, maybe it's not as clean as I think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I don't know of any way.\n",
      "In fact, I know one couple who is supposed to be hoarders, but when I've seen them out and about, I've never seen their house.\n",
      "But when I've seen them, they look very put together except for their car.\n",
      "So until I was told, I did not know about these people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Where have you heard of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Have you gotten any information on it or?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "The TV show, of course.\n",
      "And then in talking about this couple to other people, but not to them, they don't know that.\n",
      "And just in general, I've never really gone to any formal training or specific conference or anything like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what did people tell you about this couple?\n",
      "What was the information that they gave you.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "That they were hoarders and that their house has just one little path to walk through.\n",
      "One of their bathrooms, at least doesn't work very well, the sink does not work.\n",
      "And I don't know them real well, but that's what I've heard.\n",
      "Of course, I've never been to their house or anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I was just curious what people say about the disorder.\n",
      "So when you watched Hoarders, what did you take away from that show?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Certainly, I'm sure they bring the most extreme people on for the effect.\n",
      "But it's obvious that it's a mental disability, or something going on in their brain that they can not give up even on trash.\n",
      "So I don't know how they got that way and like I said, I'm sure plenty of degrees of it but the people they bring on I'm sure are the worst.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They do bring on the really extreme cases.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "015\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And also if you would like me to...\n",
      "Any of those numbers at any point, feel free to ask.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So as you know the study is investigating individuals, attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question would be what term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "What term I prefer other than hoarding, is that what you're?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So if you wouldn't like us to refer to it as hoarding, would you like it to be considered collecting or difficulties with clutter or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Hoarding is okay.\n",
      "It's not offensive, but probably I consider it clutter more so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "And then the first part of the interview is just some basic demographic questions.\n",
      "So what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Female.21qw\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "And what gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "White or Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Are you Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then what is your highest degree or level of school you've completed.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "12th grade high school.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then what is your household income?\n",
      "And it can be in range.\n",
      "It does not have to be exact.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Right now.\n",
      "It's not much with this COVID stuff, but it was about, I'd say 75,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then what is your geographic region that best describes where you live in the US, so Northeast, Midwest, South or West?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I guess it's considered Midwest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So the next part of the interview is going to consist of what we call free listing prompts.\n",
      "So the basic idea is that I'm going to ask you a question and you just try to make a concise list that's in a bullet point format.\n",
      "So if I were to ask you, what do you usually buy at the grocery store?\n",
      "You would just be like, \"Milk, eggs, bread.\"\n",
      "And that kind of idea, does that makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the first question is, can you please list all the things that might contribute to the development of having difficulties, like getting rid of clutter?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "The things that contribute to having clutter is things like an emotional attachment, someone gave you something, something that you like and don't want to get rid of, or that you think you'll need sometimes.\n",
      "Is that what you mean about this?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Those are all good.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "You could have too much clutter depending on the size of your house too.\n",
      "That's something important.\n",
      "So those kinds of things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that being married to him has helped her behavior or is she hiding it?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "She's hiding it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Most definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about, can you think back to when you were married, was your husband understanding of it or did he have the same behavior?\n",
      "He was understanding of it?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Yes, he had no problems with my saving a moving ticket from going to the movies, or finding something that had meaning to me, or bringing home books was never a problem for him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Can you tell me a little bit more about your relationship with your oldest son, the one who you'd say is a minimalist?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mean as far as his behavior?\n",
      "How he reacts to me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, how he reacts to you?\n",
      "Does he visit often or do you visit him often?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "He does not visit me because the house honestly isn't big enough for him and his family to come and visit because it's small.\n",
      "But, before that when I lived in a house in the country that was the one he grew up in, he and his wife did visit.\n",
      "They then moved to the Buffalo area, near where her parents are, and it's about a three hour drive for me to get there.\n",
      "They do not come this way to visit, maybe but once or twice a year, and that's usually for a Christmas or an Easter, and we all get together at my daughter's house because it's big enough for everybody.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, you have maybe bought a couple of...\n",
      "Maybe you've bought more food than you would normally, but not so much that it's going bad?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, yeah.\n",
      "I did buy a little extra for just in case I wouldn't be able to buy it in the future.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like the situation has impacted you in terms of your anxiety?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, yeah, because, well, it has an impact financially a little bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, there's been a financial impact that's made it harder for you to meet your obligations with paying for the space to save your items.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Oh. Well, if you want to put it that way...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No, no. I guess what I'm trying to ask about is if you feel like things with your clutter have changed since COVID got started.\n",
      "It doesn't sound like you've really been getting more stuff.\n",
      "It doesn't sound like-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, no. I try to avoid buying too much physical items anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It sounds like most of the things that you have are old, and it's not like you go out and buy new things or find new things and bring them into your apartment.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's mostly stuff that you already had or that you've had for a long time, or that come from your family.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there new things coming into your apartment?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I just want to have that stuff organized, and then once I've gone through it, I won't need to keep it myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But you're not adding to those items at all?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "No. Now, a few years ago I went to some flea markets and things and bought some extra, but-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "These days, you're not really doing that?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I have a friend who is into art, who collects paintings, so a couple of years ago I went to her place and I bought a few of those, but I don't necessarily... I can't really use paintings and art myself, so I will tend to avoid buying any more of that anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "So, a few years ago you acquired some paintings, but they aren't really useful for you, so you don't plan on acquiring any more?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right, because now I only have it for the chance of reselling it, and then there's that other thing of if I can make a profit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, but it sounds like these days it's less of an issue for you.\n",
      "You're not thinking about reselling things as much as you used to.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Or at least not buying anything new to try to resell.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That kind of leads into the next question, what does hoarding disorder look like?\n",
      "How is it the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Well, I keep going back to those shows, which I don't watch, but I've seen snippets of or seen on commercials.\n",
      "I've never been dirty, everything's clean.\n",
      "I don't have bugs or piles of old newspapers or things that attract mice.\n",
      "I picture hoarding as being you're just piling and piling stuff that is maybe useful, maybe not.\n",
      "But maybe more like trash.\n",
      "I picture hoarder as you won't get rid of anything.\n",
      "Like I said, I'm happy to get rid of things that are truly trash, or things that I can find a home for.\n",
      "Also, I picture hoarding as constantly bringing more stuff in and like I said, I've made a total consorted effort not to do that.\n",
      "I try to be really careful, especially up here, normally in summers there's a lot of barn sales and auctions.\n",
      "We do enjoy that, even my partner loves to go to them.\n",
      "But instead and going be like, oh, that's a great deal, I have to get that.\n",
      "Or oh, let me get that to sell on eBay or whatever, I try to be really careful either just not to get anything or only get that one thing that's really special or a really great deal or something I really love.\n",
      "So I think the difference between hoarding and just not is not bringing in so much stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Being able to get rid of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think there's a way to tell that someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Maybe if you were out shopping with them.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I guess it's all about what you're keeping.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I'm not sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's fine, that's fair.\n",
      "That's just we're curious to see what people have to say about that.\n",
      "You mentioned briefly before that you've seen little snippets of the show Hoarders and stuff like that.\n",
      "Where else have you gotten information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where else have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I think just that seems like that extreme and it's just like yikes.\n",
      "I guess just people talking, like, \"Oh, that person's a hoarder or that person.\"\n",
      "Actually in driving around sometimes, especially up here, again it's a rural area, you see a lot of big old farm houses that just have so much stuff spilling out of them even.\n",
      "People's porches and yards and everything is just so cluttered.\n",
      "To me that's just like ew.\n",
      "I just could never.\n",
      "But then again, is that just as bad as me having a basement that looks like [inaudible 00:33:31] in the basement.\n",
      "Then I think you shouldn't be critical of those people.\n",
      "If anybody went in your basement, they'd be like yikes.\n",
      "I mean it's a little better now, like I said.\n",
      "So yeah, I guess just you have that idea in your head of what that is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Then my last question about this, was there ever a time maybe in college that you had a roommate that you guys ever got in disagreements about clutter or did you pretty much live at home and then lived with your husband?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, actually, in high school I was in a boarding school.\n",
      "By choice.\n",
      "I had three different roommates.\n",
      "We didn't really have any real issues back then that I can remember.\n",
      "We weren't allowed to have much stuff.\n",
      "We had constant inspections and stuff.\n",
      "That kind of helped keep things in control.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I just kept all that stuff at home.\n",
      "When I'd go home, take it home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I didn't go away to college.\n",
      "I was married by that point.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It seems like overall it didn't really impact any of your relationships, whether that was family, romantic, or work at all.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Kind of my last question is would you like to change permanently or do you think this is always going to be a phase where you kind of get rid of stuff and then you might collect a little more and you have to go through periods of change?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I'll always struggle with it.\n",
      "I'll always want stuff and collect stuff.\n",
      "I'm sure even now and going into my next phase of life because I enjoy stuff.\n",
      "I enjoy having it around me.\n",
      "I can't imagine not ever having stuff around me and collecting and stuff.\n",
      "I think of my niece who has a completely bare house because she likes it that way.\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "No knick knacks.\n",
      "Hardly any furniture.\n",
      "Just completely bare house.\n",
      "I'm the exact opposite but I like having ...\n",
      "It makes me feel good.\n",
      "I enjoy seeing it.\n",
      "I can't imagine ever not being that way but it would be nice to be able to control it better so it's not so overwhelming.\n",
      "I'd like to change that I'm not interested in so many different things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever thought about seeking professional help with this?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Not about this area.\n",
      "Other areas, depression and stuff, yes, I have but those are sort of get those under control and then this would be under control is kind of my thinking.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That pretty much concludes ...\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Well, the older I get, the less attached I am to all this stuff and I've begun to realize that.\n",
      "I could probably just have my family and cousins come out here, but I don't get along with all of them, so I don't want them to go picking between my houses for things that they're waiting for me to die to get anyway.\n",
      "So how I feel about that, I've got to keep their hands off of this stuff until I'm gone, but I'd like to have it all cataloged before I go.\n",
      "So that's what I'm trying to do, so that everybody gets a piece of the pudding.\n",
      "But yeah, in a way I could have people come out, family come out, and start taking things away from me.\n",
      "And that's hard for me to get into yet.\n",
      "I may be able to get into that another year or so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "And actually have certain parts of my family come out and start to ransack my belongings.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "But I'd rather give it to them while I'm alive and that way I could at least feel good about it.\n",
      "Other than having a fight over this stuff when I'm dead, which they're going to do anyway.\n",
      "And so that's what happens when you have a lot of collection.\n",
      "Clutter is also collecting things, and so there's probably a fine line between the clutter and the collector.\n",
      "A lot of collectors are clutterers.\n",
      "I know that for fact, because I am one.\n",
      "But I'm also a collector, so I appreciate certain things.\n",
      "Yeah, so I'm stuck with all this.\n",
      "And I'm going to get rid of it.\n",
      "I'm not not attached.\n",
      "Like I told you, I have only this sentimental attachment and the art attachment.\n",
      "So other than that, it can all go.\n",
      "There's all these antiques and vintage things, they call them, and those all have values.\n",
      "So there's values attached to everything, and so I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff.\n",
      "I suppose I need someone to come and just take all these books and things and just get rid of them for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does your-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "And that's probably the most difficult thing.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "My living room is where...\n",
      "Since Covid and I was stuck here and I wasn't feeling well, and my body was falling apart, I use the living room as a place to shred papers, to sort things.\n",
      "For a while I was just boxing everything up neatly so like things were together, and then I realized that's not getting rid of anything.\n",
      "So, I went through the boxes again and started getting rid of things, but you also could not donate so that resulted in lots of things to donate that, there are bags in the basement, there's a box that's still in the living room.\n",
      "The living room is cluttered because that's my work space and it's my favorite room of the house.\n",
      "It's a small townhouse and it's the middle townhouse, so there aren't many windows.\n",
      "The living room has big patio door windows and I love the outdoors and the sunshine, and my squirrels and birds, and stuff like that, so I can use it.\n",
      "There are, to me, pathways to go through it and I guess that's how a lot of the rooms are, that you can walk about, but not easily.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, is most stuff in boxes or is it a lot of furniture?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Most of it is stuff and it's in boxes or piles which I know what they are, but like I said, if I died they would not realize that the stack of papers on my coffee table, as an example, have the little paid thing from my car that I need to send in to get the title, my 401K is there, some other stuff that's important that needs to be filed away.\n",
      "I fill up half of that table to file away, and I'm doing better at getting it filed away, but if you walk in you would not know.\n",
      "There aren't labels on things that you could tell.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "And my obsession with doing this has led me to make labels because my mother did that so that when I went through her house I found a little tiny rocking chair that I vaguely remember being around as a child, and on the bottom of it she had written that it was her chair as a child and the year, and I thought what a neat idea.\n",
      "So, I have labeled things, like dear grandmother's jewelry, a clock that my oldest son always admired that he wanted so I've got a sticker on that.\n",
      "I really don't think the kids are going to take all the time to go through that at all, but it makes me feel more secure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Which objects are most important for you?\n",
      "Which ones do you spend most of your time with?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I don't spend any time with any of them other than looking at them.\n",
      "Well, books, I guess would be ... I don't know.\n",
      "I don't spend any particular time on any one thing because I flip from thing to thing to thing because constantly changing my attention.\n",
      "Well, I mean, I'm just now stopping work so that takes up most of your day.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "I guess I spend most of my time on the computer at this point and just enjoying the stuff but I don't spend any time on it.\n",
      "I guess gardening but that's a whole different subject.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You'd say you spend most of your free time gardening and then on the computer?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, it's also that it has to get done too.\n",
      "Free time, at this point, yeah, it's actually on the computer.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you think about your possessions, what makes them available?\n",
      "How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "If it fits the collection or if it was given by somebody, it has sentimental value, I guess really.\n",
      "Other than the books that were fun to read.\n",
      "It depends on the item.\n",
      "Mostly sentiment or if it's an area that I have enjoyed or have interest in makes it valuable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's more like your own personal value to it?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then what do you consider trash or what do you discard?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "What's discard?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I guess if it doesn't really ...\n",
      "If somebody gives me something that doesn't really fit, it takes a long time for me to get rid of it because somebody has given it to me but eventually if it finally is not in good condition or doesn't fit whatever collection or whatever, I can get rid of it.\n",
      "If it's papers and has no value, not needed anymore, I can get rid of those.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I guess it's condition and whether or not it fits.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you say when it fits your collection, what kind of collections do you have?\n",
      "What's an item that wouldn't fit in your collection that you'd feel okay getting rid of?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, okay.\n",
      "One of the collections are nesting dolls.\n",
      "If somebody gives me a set of nesting dolls that I don't really care for, I will get rid of it after a period of time.\n",
      "Right now, there's very little room anyway so it's kind of ... I don't go out and buy them anymore.\n",
      "I don't go ...\n",
      "Unless they're really, really special ones.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "For instance, I don't care for Santa Claus.\n",
      "My son gave me a Santa Claus set.\n",
      "Well, took about 10 years but I got rid of one set and have another one I'll get rid of eventually.\n",
      "I don't want to hurt his feelings either but that kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you talk about things that could be of value to you or your family, you mean they could be sentimentally of value, they could be important in the history of your family and in kind of the memories of your family, or they could be valuable in an objective sense because they're antiques?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like right now you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I'm still working on going through it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you know that the stuff that you have now is too much?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, the high cost of rent.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If that wasn't an issue, if you had a bigger space where you could keep all of your stuff, would you keep it all, if the money wasn't an issue?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I would still try to keep things organized.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, if you didn't have to-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "If I were able to organize it, then... I mean, if it was totally organized and it looked like everything was in the proper place, then I wouldn't necessarily consider that a hoard or clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, even if money wasn't an issue, you would be okay with the amount of stuff you had, as long as it was all organized.\n",
      "So, organization is really the key for you.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's the main thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, if money wasn't an issue and you could get it all organized, you would keep everything, but in an organized way?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I still don't think I would want to keep everything because I would prefer to be able to hand off some things, as I found someone else who could use it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, this goes back to something that we talked about before.\n",
      "When you think about your behavior, how do you distinguish between keeping things in a collection or just normally saving or preserving things, and something that's hoarding or something that's clutter?\n",
      "What makes a difference?\n",
      "Is it that organization?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, yes, organization and livability.\n",
      "So, if things are all in the way and causing you anxiety in life, then it's hoarding or clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it's not about the amount of stuff.\n",
      "It's about how organized the stuff is and whether or not it's in the way?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, it could also be the amount of things if later in life it's going to cause stress in order to deal with what to do with things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "So, even if it was perfectly organized, if it was going to cause you stress to deal with it in the future, it would still be too much?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Now, I have been in collector groups, like an antique collectors' group, and some of them have things very well organized.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you be upset if you had to give up some of your items?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Well, a little bit.\n",
      "I mean I wouldn't go ...\n",
      "It depends on which items I had to get rid of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "[inaudible 00:16:58].\n",
      "Which items do you think would make you the most upset to give away?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I thought you had already asked me that once.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "My CDs, my books.\n",
      "My movies and my clothes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "And I suppose my electronic things.\n",
      "TV, the computer, printer.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between normal saving behavior to just collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Well, if you watch the TV show on hoarding, they save stuff that makes no sense, like newspapers and pieces of paper and the styrofoam dishes or just anything that has absolutely no use to anybody.\n",
      "Maybe sometimes they don't throw out their food or something like that.\n",
      "To me, a worry gets on a worry of saving things that have no use at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how is that same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I do throw out dirty pieces of paper and bottles and cans and cigarette butts and pieces of paper and even clothes once in a while when I have energy to go through them.\n",
      "I have not thrown out bills in a long, long time and they definitely need to be.\n",
      "I've been thinking about paying somebody to go through them and throw them out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "That's basically it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "Where do you get information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "You mentioned the TV, but I'm wondering if there's any other place maybe?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. I read about it years ago in psychology class, and I see those shows on TV, but I don't watch them particularly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How has COVID 19 impacted you?\n",
      "Has it impacted any cluttering behaviors?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Probably a little worse because I have to stay home so much.\n",
      "I used to eat out so I didn't have to wash dishes and I didn't have quite as many styrofoam cups maybe.\n",
      "I probably didn't even smoke as much because when I'm in the car I'm not as likely to smoke as I am sitting here.\n",
      "What me looking at the computer for hours and hours and hours, and I don't really go anywhere.\n",
      "I'm very afraid of getting it, so it really limits what I can do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Has it affected your difficulties of throwing things away?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How has COVID affected your sense of connectiveness or attachment to your items?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I don't think it has.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Since COVID, how do you think your attempts to declutter have been affected?\n",
      "Have you had any more time for organizing?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. I'm just as lazy as I'm sitting here now as I ever was before.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "They bring memories.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so that nostalgia?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Nostalgia, that's the word.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Well, pretty much if it has any use at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So just any utility for specific purpose?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I don't like wasting things, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And how do you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "When I can't think of any use for it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And what do you consider trash?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Something that has no function and no sentimental value.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So I know that you mentioned that your photographs are the most precious item in your house for you, but what would happen if you lost all of them?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "I would feel terrible.\n",
      "That's all my memories.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And do you personally think that you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "That's a good question.\n",
      "Probably to a certain extent.\n",
      "And like I said, these boxes that we haven't gone through yet, I'm sure there's plenty we could get rid of still, but most of the stuff I think we should keep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how would you decide when you have too much?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Mm, that's a good question.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I guess if it was interfering with the quality of life in the house, if we couldn't get around the stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So when it would start to interfere with your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Back to the same old thing, if it had a sentimental value and if it had a use, I would want to keep it if it didn't-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you prioritize one over the other though?\n",
      "Would you prioritize your sentimentality over the utility?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behaviors, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Well, collections are organized for one thing and they usually have value.\n",
      "I do have a stamp collection.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so just-\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "But most of it-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "And I have lots of video tapes that I've accumulated through the years and I know they're getting deteriorated.\n",
      "So as soon as I retire eventually, I'm going to have to transfer them all to DVDs.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So the difference would be the organization and the monetary value?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "I guess, without going in?\n",
      "If there's an odor coming from their home or if they can't leave, if friends and family are complaining, things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did that ever happen with your son at all?\n",
      "Did he ever try to get rid of something without you knowing?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "No, I think he's the only one that understands me.\n",
      "He doesn't get it, I don't think.\n",
      "That's the main reason I moved to Vermont after I retired, was he's a farmer up here.\n",
      "He's awesome we're extremely close, he's my only child.\n",
      "But he, and I always say this to him and we joke about it.\n",
      "I'm like, I'm so glad you didn't wind up being a hoarder like me.\n",
      "His farm is beautiful, everything is in its place, he's so organized.\n",
      "They just got married so they have this great little house that they built and everything is in its place and they don't ever take anything.\n",
      "Like my mother sent up a van for them with this carload just now and they're not going to want anything because they only have what they need.\n",
      "They're real thrifty and it's awesome and it's amazing to see.\n",
      "Thank god he didn't get that from me.\n",
      "But he'll laugh and I still find things.\n",
      "He's 34 years old, I still have his baby clothes.\n",
      "I have all of his stuff from when he was a kid.\n",
      "It's just I don't know, that's something I don't know if I'll ever be able to bring myself to get rid of.\n",
      "But a lot of his stuff from when he was teenager, I have CDS that he doesn't listen to anymore.\n",
      "Civil War jackets, whatever, and that's stuff that I've been selling on eBay.\n",
      "I always give him the money.\n",
      "He's like, \"No, no, no, just keep it.\n",
      "You're doing all the work.\"\n",
      "I'm like, no, no, no.\n",
      "He just gets a kick out of it that I still have the stuff, but I am getting rid of it for him.\n",
      "But the real little baby stuff, I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to get rid of that.\n",
      "But he's very gentle with me.\n",
      "Everybody else is kind of mocking.\n",
      "Thank goodness he's not like that, but he's very caring about the fact that I am and he gets it.\n",
      "But I still like when he goes down to the basement to our fridge to get a beer or something, I'm mortified that he sees it.\n",
      "But he would never say anything though.\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm lucky in that respect.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha. Okay. And then, here's the next one.\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "His house is extremely cluttered, and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.\n",
      "Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet.\n",
      "So, he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "What do you think about this person?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, definitely a disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, why do you think this person has it versus that person that doesn't?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Just from the impact on his quality of life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And where do you see yourself in between these two people?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Pretty close to the first one.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "But not ...\n",
      "Maybe on the surface it looks very similar, but when I'm hearing the two stories what is not being described, it's all from an outsider's perspective.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "And there's no sense of the inner emotional state of either John Doe, and I think that that inner emotional state probably is tied to why, for one, he values the boxes so much more than he values other things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Like being able to get into his bathroom.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "And that's probably the key point, is that internal value system, how out of whack is that relative to just being...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "You have sort of practically function in life in that sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it's the quality of life.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "On the surface I'd look like number one, but I probably have all that stuff of number two.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:50:13].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just the difference in severity.\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, I've got two more.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "John Doe has books and papers, papers from school and things that are from the past, that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future.\n",
      "These items occupy most of his rooms, except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.\n",
      "Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is usually late to getting where he needs to be.\n",
      "So, what do you think about this one?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Definitely disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, this last one.\n",
      "And why do you think that, really quick?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Again, it's affecting his daily life.\n",
      "He can't take a shower without moving stuff around.\n",
      "011\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So as you know, the study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question would be, what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "What terms are you offering me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It could be any terms that you feel comfortable with.\n",
      "It can be either hoarding disorder, or just clutter, or anything you prefer.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, I've always called it clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So thank you for creating those lists for me.\n",
      "And the next part of the interview is more of a conversation.\n",
      "So I will ask you questions for you to answer and feel free to ask questions if you need any clarification.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "And if any questions make you uncomfortable, just let me know and you don't need to answer them.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's good, nothing makes me uncomfortable anymore.\n",
      "But when I think about all the clutter and try to explain it to myself, sometimes it does make me feel a little uncomfortable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "So first question is, can you please describe your clutter and how long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Well, I mainly, at this point, I'm a paper clutterer.\n",
      "It's been going on for maybe 50 years out of my 81 years.\n",
      "So since I was about 30, maybe even younger, I'm trying to think though when I was in my twenties.\n",
      "No, I liked to have a clean house when I was in my twenties.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Didn't want to have anything.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I was about 30 years old when I started gathering the dust around me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "How severe would you say that this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "It's pretty darn severe.\n",
      "I remember when I was a young man, I walked into some old guy's house and he had saved every newspaper in his life.\n",
      "You couldn't even move in his house.\n",
      "He had like pathways around newspapers that were all bound up and they went from floor to ceiling.\n",
      "And I don't get that far.\n",
      "Sometimes it gets up to my knees around papers.\n",
      "And I just mean, I don't save newspapers or clippings anymore.\n",
      "I used to, but I don't do that.\n",
      "But I do have a tendency to put things on the kitchen sink and things like that.\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Hi, that's me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. The last question to wrap this whole interview up is, do you think this behavior gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Would you like to change it?\n",
      "Why, or why not?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Absolutely, I would like to change.\n",
      "I would like to change because I'd like to have a house that I could have people come into without being embarrassed, and have things more organized.\n",
      "I don't know how to do that.\n",
      "I can't see the overall [inaudible 00:53:45] I could work on the kitchen counter and get the kitchen counters cleaned, but I don't know how to take the whole kit and caboodle of everything and do that.\n",
      "And, I know I don't want anyone to do it for me just because of being afraid that I will lose something that's important, but I would love to be more organized.\n",
      "I see I'm getting there, but I got a long ways to go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well thank you for sharing that.\n",
      "So this concludes...\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes. Can you please describe where you live now?\n",
      "So what is the space like, or do you live alone currently?\n",
      "How's your home looking right now?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Well, my home is always a mess.\n",
      "My home is a mess.\n",
      "I'm just looking at my table here.\n",
      "And there's two laptops and three iPods and I'm working on a stereo for a friend of mine who bought one at Goodwill and it was broken.\n",
      "So I'm trying to fix it for him.\n",
      "So therefore I got soldering arms and screws and things all over the place.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "It's a total mess.\n",
      "You put your hands on your ears and go screaming out of the house.\n",
      "But no, I inherited a house that was full of stuff.\n",
      "And so I'm now living alone, but the house is a big house.\n",
      "So it's very empty.\n",
      "There's a lot of space available.\n",
      "My partner was a bird fanatic, collected birds.\n",
      "So I'm stuck with a bunch of doves and parakeets.\n",
      "So it's like living in aviary.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff, but it's very difficult for me.\n",
      "Like I told you, I don't really have a lot of help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "It's so hard to get rid of live things and when you're attached to them.\n",
      "And so it's more difficult to get rid of live things than it is inanimate objects, let me tell you.\n",
      "It's easy to get rid of an old stereo, but try to get rid of a eight year old parakeet.\n",
      "Find the right home for it, that's what I'm always trying to do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Are there parts your home that you consider cluttered?\n",
      "Or-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Pardon me, but this house I'm in is not cluttered right now, other than my work table, everything else is neat.\n",
      "And I've made a purpose for not cluttering this up.\n",
      "My other house is just a mess, but this house I'm actually going to rent out.\n",
      "That's why I try not to fill it up with junk.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "But I have been moving some of my stuff into this house, which is a bad sign, because that just means I'm going to clutter it up and I don't want to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Are there objects that are most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there objects that are most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "What's that word?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Objects or possessions?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Objects.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "No, I don't have any objects anymore.\n",
      "I really don't hoard objects other than things I need, that I use every day.\n",
      "And let me see, my dog is barking here and it's going to bark.\n",
      "I think he has to go outside to the potty.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you base trash or you know when it's time to get rid of something when it's extremely worn or it doesn't really have a use for you.\n",
      "Or you feel better about getting rid of it, if you can donate it to someone you know needs it.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So what would you consider your most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "In a fire if I were to run out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's pretty much what everyone does...\n",
      "In that scenario, what would you be able to grab?\n",
      "What would you be like, \"I need this.\"\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I guess, pictures on my computer or phone.\n",
      "Just because information is on there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Because things like that wouldn't really be replaceable, but you could get a new bed, or a new couch, or something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, how about if you just lost these, not necessarily in a fire but you just couldn't find them?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "The phone or computer or pictures that I mentioned.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If those are your most precious item, what would happen if you lost those?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I guess I'd be sad, but...\n",
      "Well, I don't know.\n",
      "I'd be disappointed, but I would have to rely on my memory to conjure up those thoughts again.\n",
      "And perhaps I could get some of the information back from other people, phone numbers, or information on the computer from different sites, or pictures that maybe somebody else has duplicates or of the kids or something when they're little.\n",
      "Because I would say the kids being little is the pictures that I probably cherish the most because you can't get that time back.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, that makes sense.\n",
      "So briefly before you mentioned that you think that you have too much stuff, your closet, you might have too much clothes.\n",
      "How do you decide when it's too much and when it's time to get rid of something?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I think basically when you go to put more hangers in there with clean clothes on them.\n",
      "And then you just really squeeze and can't fit them in.\n",
      "So I suppose if I had double the closet space, I probably would say, \"Oh, it's okay.\n",
      "I have just enough.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you judge it based on the space and how much room you have.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Not necessarily, I was just curious because sometimes some people have like a track record.\n",
      "They're like, \"Oh yeah.\n",
      "I like to keep all my toys.\"\n",
      "Since they were young kid, but that's not the case everyone's different.\n",
      "So you said you don't believe that your behavior is that severe right now, right?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't think so because every electric outlet and faucet and so forth works in the house and I can get to all that stuff.\n",
      "None of the entrances are blocked, to me that would be severe as far as hoarding, but we have access to all that business.\n",
      "For instance, my closet of clothes is too tight and there's stuff I probably haven't worn for a number of years.\n",
      "Should get rid of and it's like, \"Oh, maybe I would use this.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Have you gone to professional help?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No, I haven't.\n",
      "Although my husband is the type that says, \"We need to get rid of some stuff and then I occasionally will ask him, \"Okay, what do you think we should get rid of?\" And then he'll instead of telling me, \"These papers or you should clear out the kitchen of this and this.\"\n",
      "He'll tell me a piece of furniture and I'll say, \"Yeah, but that's full of such and such.\n",
      "And so how can you get rid of that without getting rid...\"\n",
      "So we've had these discussions in the household, but I've never actually sought help for it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And so you mentioned that you and your husband discuss getting rid of stuff.\n",
      "How does your family feel about it?\n",
      "Like your children or does he ever...\n",
      "Do you ever get in arguments about it?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I wouldn't say arguments, but I know he feels like, \"Too much stuff.\"\n",
      "The kids I've kept some stuff specifically for them, their baby books, or pictures, or something, or a project, or craft that they've done.\n",
      "And they always say, \"Get rid of that stuff.\n",
      "We don't want it.\"\n",
      "But then if I pull it out when they're here, they get a kick out of it.\n",
      "So I guess I kind of do it for the, \"Oh my gosh.\n",
      "I remember that reaction.\"\n",
      "So I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So they've never really got in huge arguments and it's never caused serious conflict between you and your family?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No, not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, kind of the opposite of that first question is what do you consider trash?\n",
      "How do you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, I've been going...\n",
      "Things like books that I know I'm not going to read again, I've been working with that.\n",
      "A lot of paper that I'm thinking, oh my gosh, I just haven't bothered to get rid of it.\n",
      "I don't need it, so a lot of old papers and things like that I need to get rid of that I [inaudible 00:19:53] and I'm feeling less attachment to anything like that.\n",
      "I have no problem getting rid of... what am I trying to think?\n",
      "Actually, well shoes are something that I have no problem getting rid of if they're not comfortable and I don't like the way they look on my feet, and that's gotten more important to me as I've gotten older is that they need to be comfortable, so that's what I'm...\n",
      "But I have this thing about trash as opposed to can I recycle this?\n",
      "This things of is it something that I should throw away or it's bad for the environment to throw away stuff so I need to find a way to recycle whatever it is and then I get stuck with not getting rid of something because I'm thinking, \"Oh, well I need to take this next step and figure out how to recycle whatever it is.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it sounds like when you have the most difficulty getting rid of something is actually getting rid of it because you can't decide if it needs to be thrown away or recycled or donated?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, when you think about all your possessions, what is the most precious item in your house?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Oh. Well, something that I definitely wouldn't want to lost in a fire or something would be my picture albums.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, would happen if you did lose them, say in a fire or someone through them out on accident?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, it wouldn't be a disaster because I actually... my favorite pictures I have scanned, so they're in the cloud somewhere so I could go see those again, so that wouldn't be a total disaster.\n",
      "In fact, it's funny because right now we're having all these fires in California and I was reading about people losing their houses and I remember years ago talking to this woman who lost her house in a fire and she said she suddenly felt free [crosstalk 00:22:21] all this stuff.\n",
      "It occurred to me that it might be very freeing if you suddenly had a disaster and lost all your stuff, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I guess, yeah.\n",
      "There's no one to blame.\n",
      "It was a natural disaster.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "In actuality, if I think about it there is no one thing that would really be devastating if I lost it.\n",
      "I just need to let that sink in.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you would have an easier time getting organized if there was a place that you could drop things off?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, if there was more things available.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like what's stopping you from getting organized is not having enough space in your apartment, or is it not having enough time in your day, or is it your anxiety?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, there's not having enough space or not having enough money to move to a bigger space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, if you had a bigger space, then that would be helpful in helping you get organized?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, does this problem upset you?\n",
      "Does it make you feel upset when you think about it?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, not being able to find a place that's affordable in a safe area.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does the problem of having too much stuff upset you?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, but I would feel better if I could have the space to get it all organized.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you feel like right now having all of this stuff is getting in the way of your life?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "In what way?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, the financial burden of having too much rent or...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Having to pay all that money for storage space is getting in the way?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "And also, still being overwhelmed with...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The process?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... figuring out what to do with certain things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there a time that you can remember when all of this stuff got in the way of something that you wanted or something that you wanted to do, or got in the way of your life at all?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does it impact your relationships, your friendships, or romantic relationships, or relationships with family?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I often would rather stay at home to go through things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you'd rather stay at home and go through things as opposed to going out and meeting people or going out with friends?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "But I do go out and meet with friends anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, sometimes you do that anyway.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Now, when I do, then this becomes out of sight, out of mind.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, once you're out of your apartment, you no longer think about your stuff, and you just enjoy being out with your friends?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, no. I still think about it.\n",
      "It's just that I'm not spending time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You're not spending time on it?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is this behavior of saving so much, is this something that you'd like to change?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I guess, but I still need to go through everything.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "So I'm not one of these old guys who are going to get dementia because I'm always looking for something that I can't find.\n",
      "So that keeps my memory fairly sharp.\n",
      "So it's kind of a lesson in disguise, but I'm not giving myself credit for having so much clutter that I have to remember where everything is, but it does help to have a good memory.\n",
      "I can go to my garage and sometimes I can find things that I remembered that have been there for 10, 15, 20 years.\n",
      "And like I told you earlier, I don't have to go out and buy a new ratchet saw or something.\n",
      "I have one already and I remember where it is.\n",
      "And some of my family finds that they say, \"Gee, you're amazing Len, that you can remember all this.\"\n",
      "They're always telling me that.\n",
      "I say, \"Well, if you have all this junk that I have, you got to have your memory good.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "So that keeps my family at bay and they admire me for having the memory to keep track of all this stuff, which a lot of people can't keep track of.\n",
      "They just go, \"Oh my God, how do you keep track of all that stuff?\" I said, \"Well, it's all in my memory, but I don't want it to be there.\n",
      "I wish I had all this stuff that keeps in my memory.\"\n",
      "It bogs me down, it ties me down.\n",
      "I'm memory bound as they say.\n",
      "So that's the answer to that question, I'm memory bound by having all this stuff, which I don't want to be memory bound.\n",
      "I want to be able to free my memories from holding on to years and years of accumulation so that I could be a little bit freer in my memory.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Can you go ahead and please describe where you live now, such as do you live alone or what does-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "You're not coming through that loud and clear.\n",
      "I don't know how I am on your end but-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Go slower.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, does your behavior upset you or do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "It doesn't get in the way of my life because I skirt it, I get around it.\n",
      "But it's like I told you, it sort of encompasses...\n",
      "Makes things a little more difficult for me to do everything.\n",
      "Man, I've been doing it for so many years, I managed it really well.\n",
      "And I can live with all this stuff.\n",
      "At the same time, I manage my life fairly well.\n",
      "I'm not tied down by it.\n",
      "I can take vacations and whatnot.\n",
      "And nobody in my family, like I told you earlier, has accused me of being a hoarder.\n",
      "So one of my daughters once said to me that, \"Dad, you just hoard everything,\" and I kind of got angry here at that time.\n",
      "That was about 30 years ago.\n",
      "I kind of got angry at her at the time, and then she became a hoarder.\n",
      "So, what can I say?\n",
      "Maybe it is in the genes here.\n",
      "That's what I [inaudible 00:51:48] I was thinking, \"Well, maybe it's some genetic stuff going on here that we can't control.\"\n",
      "And I don't know how this study, the one you're working with, is attached to the genetics study, but I would be really interested to find that out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that would be interesting.\n",
      "And what do you-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Because I'm saying my family, it has a tendency to hoard, but I'm the worst of the lot.\n",
      "But there's other people in my family are doing the same thing I'm doing.\n",
      "So, I don't know if it's contagious or not.\n",
      "Maybe it's a distant contagious genetic frailty of sorts.\n",
      "But anyway, it's interesting, this hoarding thing.\n",
      "And it doesn't depress me.\n",
      "Like you asked me earlier, it's not depression.\n",
      "I don't get depressed.\n",
      "I get encumbered by it.\n",
      "And at the same time, it encumbers me, it always traps me.\n",
      "But then I feel secure within that encumbrance.\n",
      "So, it's a double deep blue sea divers thing here.\n",
      "I enjoy having a lot of stuff around me.\n",
      "At the same time, I feel it's a burden and a weight on me.\n",
      "And a lot of people do this, but that's what you get with having too many possessions.\n",
      "But like I told you, I'm not attached.\n",
      "I can drop it in a second.\n",
      "I'm wanting to get rid of all the stuff.\n",
      "It's just so hard.\n",
      "It's so hard to find the right type of people who want to take over the...\n",
      "Unload me of things without stealing.\n",
      "But I'm bringing boxes to the Goodwill every month, so it's happening.\n",
      "It's coming along.\n",
      "One of these days, I'll get the garage cleaned up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow. What was that like for you to finally throw it out?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Certainly stressful, and it was, I guess, I felt very guilty about never finishing it.\n",
      "Yeah, every time you see it, which is not very often, but I would kind of feel a little twinge for throwing it out because I had a lot more emotion I tied to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "But I think now that it's gone I'll probably never think about this again, hopefully.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how does that feel?\n",
      "Cause here you are struggling with it, right, thinking about it being in the trash.\n",
      "But now it's gone.\n",
      "How ... I guess this is ... I have a couple questions there.\n",
      "How long was that period, that now it's gone you won't think of it?\n",
      "And how does that feel to kind of think about how you won't be thinking about it again?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I'm looking forward to not thinking about it, maybe not feeling guilty, but it has certainly been, for what is basically just a pile of paper and a couple note books, I've thought about it way more than I want this week.\n",
      "That's for sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Of course, you're going to ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I don't know if I'm answering your questions.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. Yeah, it's just I think we ruminate over these things, and then now it's gone, and you might not even think about it.\n",
      "I think having that insight can help facilitate more discarding of stuff.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, and I probably have, a little bit unique in the sense of seeing my dad with it, that I've been aware that it's an issue since I was young.\n",
      "And, you know, I can see what happens if it runs unchecked and what a burden that can be just for him and then for people around him too.\n",
      "So, in my case, people around me, and I don't want that to be a burden for other people.\n",
      "But its helped me, I guess, keep it from being out of control, but I think all the same, emotions are there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what other emotions do you think you said?\n",
      "Guilt?\n",
      "Are there other emotions that are pretty related to your problems with hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "That's probably the biggest one.\n",
      "Just kind of haven't thought of this before, but loneliness.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Actually.\n",
      "I think there's some comfort having stuff around.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Maybe the people are gone, but the stuff is still there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Sometimes we can ...\n",
      "Kind of like a memento or something.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "We replace that.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, we can send you-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I'm hoping you can just add onto that one rather than give me another one.\n",
      "Like I say, that's just making more clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "If you give me another card, then I may have to go through the whole rigamarole of doing the pins and all that stuff again, which I can't stand.\n",
      "Yeah, if you could just use that Bank of America card I got from University of Florida, that would be really nice.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Let me see what I can do.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, electronically.\n",
      "All they have to do is just throwing a couple of bucks onto it there.\n",
      "I still have a few dollars.\n",
      "I think I used it once for something.\n",
      "But yeah, that would be perfect for me.\n",
      "Keep the clutter down.\n",
      "If you give me a new card, then I got to go through that whole rigamarole.\n",
      "I have a box of these darn gift cards, like I told you.\n",
      "I don't know which has money on it or which doesn't.\n",
      "That means I have to call these companies, do all this, and do all that.\n",
      "I'm bogged down by it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So once again, thank you for participating.\n",
      "And we sincerely appreciate your help as we try to better understand [crosstalk 01:25:10].\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, where are you calling from, Katia?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm calling from California,\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "But where?\n",
      "Is it in the Bay Area or Southern California?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Southern California.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Oh my God.\n",
      "Yeah, you got that nasty San Fernando Valley fire down there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Awful.\n",
      "And then that awful one down there in San Diego.\n",
      "So you guys got a lot of smoke down there too, right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, we do.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "It's been hotter than hell.\n",
      "121 in LA yesterday.\n",
      "Holy cow.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you have any questions or concerns?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "No. No, I think we covered it.\n",
      "Like I said, I'd just like to, sooner or later, find the outcome of the study.\n",
      "See if there's anything that you can come about that can help us older people who are clutter bees like myself so we get some light at the end of the tunnel.\n",
      "And the most important thing, is there a genetic connection?\n",
      "That's the one I want to know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Is there going to be a genetic heritage study of the clutter?\n",
      "That's the other thing I would like to know about.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I will make sure to let Interviewer know that you want that information.\n",
      "She can send that to you.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's why I signed up for the saliva test, to begin with.\n",
      "And hopefully, we can find out if it had something to do with the genetic makeup.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I understand.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Why is that one valuable?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "The most precious?\n",
      "I can't say that there's any one particular because I have so many I like.\n",
      "My most precious possessions are my family and my cat.\n",
      "As far as items are concerned, they all have value to me in one way or another.\n",
      "You know, if we had a fire and we were running out and I had to grab one thing, other than the computer and my phone and the cat, there isn't probably one in particular that I would grab above anything else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No singular thing is coming to your mind beside your computer and your phone and your cat?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No. Not in any of the collections because I like them all pretty equally.\n",
      "There's not one item above others.\n",
      "That includes pictures, paintings and other things too that we have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there one collection that you value more than another?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "There may be pieces of each collection, like in the nesting dolls.\n",
      "There's one set that is highly valuable, in a sense, to me, because of its ornateness, how it was made, and there's one or two in my other collections that I have a lot of different collections so they're specific.\n",
      "Actually, I guess I have to take that back.\n",
      "I have a pair of handmade dolls from Hungary that were made in the war and made by somebody who has the same name as my mom.\n",
      "Those are sentimentally quite valuable to me.\n",
      "I think those would be the thing I would grab before anything else.\n",
      "Which collection of things?\n",
      "It depends on my mood.\n",
      "I'm constantly changing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What would be my favorite collection right now would change in a few minutes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would happen if you lost those dolls that you said are really valuable to you?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "What would happen?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like how would you feel?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I don't know how to ...\n",
      "All I can relate to is when my cousin, their house burned down and they lost a lot of things that were valuable to them, one of which was a Japanese doll.\n",
      "I mean, it was a family heirloom and all of us mourned over that one but you get over it.\n",
      "There's nothing you can do about it so you have to move on.\n",
      "It'd be depressing but if I lost it, it'd be because there was a whole lot of other things being lost too.\n",
      "It'd be painful.\n",
      "It'd be very painful.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "But it's funny because I think it's the same thing, my mother... well, for her it was being a child of scarcity and then being married to my father and the same thing with moving every year or two for the first third of her marriage, and so then once she got settled in a place same kind of thing.\n",
      "It's like, \"I'm here.\n",
      "I don't want to leave.\"\n",
      "That's why he couldn't get her to move into an independent place.\n",
      "She wouldn't leave the home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, between your mom, your father, and you, did it ever cause a lot of problems?\n",
      "Did you guys ever get in any fights over keeping things?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I don't know of any fights.\n",
      "There certainly weren't any fights with me because when I was a kid you just did what you were told and you just did it, and my mother I think, who knows in the privacy of my mom and dad whether there were fights about it, but I do know when we were going through there was a heck of a lot of stuff she had, so.\n",
      "I think he just put up with it.\n",
      "But you know, the same kind of thing, their public rooms were all beautiful.\n",
      "Their living room, all of that was beautiful and well kept and everything and the stuff she kept was confined to her desk, her file cabinets, her closet, that kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, your clutter was organized and hidden so the rooms everyone needed were accessible?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You could walk into their house and it was very pristine and beautifully decorated and all of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you mentioned you have sisters, did you ever get in fights with them about sharing things or having too much, or your whole time when you were living under your parent's roof it was never a problem because your dad was very minimal?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, my sister a year younger than me, the two of us shared a room for years and we were always really rigid about this half of the room is yours, this half of mine.\n",
      "Keep you and your stuff on your side.\n",
      "So, it wasn't a fight over how much stuff there was, it was just making sure that you adhered to your half of the room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I also have a younger sister that I shared a room with and that was very much how we did it.\n",
      "It was like a line down the middle, basically.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And my sister used to have nightmares and she'd tried to get in bed with me and I'm like, \"You can't do that.\n",
      "You have to go to your side.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, that's very much how it was.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Excuse me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, your fine.\n",
      "So, you mentioned you also have a son, do you just have the one son?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "And then rather quickly I would realize that things really don't matter in life.\n",
      "What matters in life are my connections to people who love me and care about me.\n",
      "That's what's important.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it would be [crosstalk 00:34:36].\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "And that could go on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it would be an initial shock and feeling overwhelmed.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then you would come to your logic and be like, it's the connections that matter and not the objects that represent those connections.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And do you think you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Oh, I know I have too much stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you decide when you have too much, or how do you know?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I don't have duplicates of things except on rare occasions I'll buy a peanut butter when I already had two jars in the pantry, but normally I don't have duplicates of things around.\n",
      "And I've forgotten the question again.\n",
      "What was the question?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you decide when you have too much?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Clothes, when I no longer have places to hang them or store them folded in chests.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Books when I have run out of room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "A friend recently moved and she returned to me a, I think, one, two, three, four, five, six shelved teak bookcase, and so I immediately filled it up with books and on the bottom is a big Crockpot that I didn't have a place for.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's when you realize things don't have their place anymore because that space has run out?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Oh. Well, I think it would depend on how important the item was to me or how valuable I knew it was in money or that I could sell it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I don't...\n",
      "How would I know when it's time to get rid of something?\n",
      "Is that what you said?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "This one is if you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Oh. Interviewer:\n",
      "So would it be monetary value or sentimentality value?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I wold think the condition of it.\n",
      "I'm looking at... I have one, two, three a big three shelves filled with cookbooks and gardening books.\n",
      "Most of those are 10, 20, 30 years old.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "A lot of them are out of date.\n",
      "They're just like, Raw Food for Everyone.\n",
      "I've never liked raw food except salads.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, actually.\n",
      "Yeah. The last part, actually, we're going to go ahead and collect some demographic and payment information.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I don't need another gift card.\n",
      "Talk about hoarding, I have a dozen of these things.\n",
      "Not from you guys but from everybody else.\n",
      "And some of these cards I've never even used so I don't even know what's on them.\n",
      "I hate gift cards.\n",
      "I got them all over the place and I don't know how much money is on them.\n",
      "Then you got to call Visa or MasterCard and find out.\n",
      "That's another thing that bothers me.\n",
      "So yeah, if I could just have it added on to the card that I got from the previous study I did, that would be delightful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Let me go ahead and collect your demographics and payment information real quick, just to be sure.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Sure, sure.\n",
      "Let's go over this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I'm male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what's your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And your race?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Race?\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And do you identify as Hispanic and/or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "No. I speak a little Spanish though.\n",
      "I can get along in South America.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what is your household income?\n",
      "It can be just a range, if that's okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Right now, about 65, 75 grand a year.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what is your geographic region right now?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Geographic?\n",
      "Pacific Northwest.\n",
      "We're all burning up down here.\n",
      "Where you coming from, Florida?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, I'm actually in California as well.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Oh my God.\n",
      "So then you can commiserate.\n",
      "My ex-wife is down there in Sebastopol watching all the vineyards burn up as she says.\n",
      "This is so horrible.\n",
      "Anyway, I was born in California so I know all about that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And what is your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "College grad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And was that for your bachelor's?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, I got the bachelor's.\n",
      "I started in Miami, but I never finished it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I think I went five years ago and I never got my master's because I didn't do my thesis.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And do you-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I guess I'm becoming cluttered with phones too, to tell you the truth.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I got too many phones and too many numbers in my head.\n",
      "Too many of this and too many of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And do you have a preference-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Hear the doves in the background, do you?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I do.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "That's not a tape.\n",
      "Those are live.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Do you have a preference for a physical or electronic gift card, just to be sure?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Well, what's the one I got right now?\n",
      "It's a Visa debit card, I think it is.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's a Bank of America Visa debit card, the one you got.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I had a question, it slipped my mind, I'm sure it'll come back.\n",
      "Oh, I remember.\n",
      "You mentioned that you previously were married, did your previous husband ever try to get rid of your stuff?\n",
      "Or was he accepting of your behavior?\n",
      "Was he also a collector?\n",
      "Or?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "He was pretty normal, he wasn't like Erik, my partner now.\n",
      "Literally, if he buys a new shirt, one goes to the Goodwill.\n",
      "He does not keep anything.\n",
      "But my husband was just regular.\n",
      "He didn't hoard stuff but he didn't have everything streamlined either.\n",
      "We had a huge house, our house in New Jersey that Hurricane LOCATIONy got.\n",
      "Most of my clutter was in the attic, so it was out of sight, out of mind.\n",
      "But we had so much room, huge closets.\n",
      "If it was all compacted into a small house, it probably would've looked like a lot stuff but because it was spread out, I don't even think he noticed, honestly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "He certainly never complained about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Did it ever impact your work at all?\n",
      "Did it ever create problems with coworkers?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Well, the funny thing about work is, they say two of the professions that are most pack rat oriented are librarians and teachers, and that's what I was.\n",
      "I had a huge library in the high school where I worked, which was the high school I went to and my son went to.\n",
      "I always had piles of stuff and everybody would always be like, \"Oh, look.\"\n",
      "People at school, teachers are all like that anyway.\n",
      "It was pretty good.\n",
      "Although my back storage room was pretty bad.\n",
      "When I retired, they decided to close the library and make it into a tech lab.\n",
      "So I knew everything was going to be going, they were just going to probably get rid of everything.\n",
      "So that was really stressful for me.\n",
      "It took me a couple months before I left to really try to give stuff away.\n",
      "Who wants this from the library?\n",
      "Who wants books?\n",
      "The stuff I had stored there all the years, it's not like personal stuff per se, because I taught classes too.\n",
      "So all my teaching supplies, all that stuff, that was a nightmare.\n",
      "In fact, a lot of it ended up here and I still have boxes in the basement of teaching supplies and things, which I'll never use again, I don't think.\n",
      "But then I think, well, what if I do start teaching a college class or something up here?\n",
      "It would be a bummer to have to redo everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What would you say hoarding disorder looks like?\n",
      "And how is it the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Hoarding... I always say, \"Of course I don't have that, I just collect things.\"\n",
      "But, no it's definitely an issue.\n",
      "As an example, if you said, \"Take a picture of your cluttered living room,\" I would be too embarrassed to.\n",
      "I did for my therapist and she said, \"Oh!\" Lack of organization that has gone on too long and carried on too long, would be hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "No, I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "No. I'm going to change that.\n",
      "They may be drawn to objects or pick up objects that seems silly to others to keep when they're out with other people.\n",
      "As an example, my rocks.\n",
      "Perhaps a map of a park that I would pick up and keep, whereas most people would maybe pick up a map of a park and then discard it on the way out.\n",
      "If you watch people close enough you could probably see that tendency.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Where do you get information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Probably psychological journals or research that I've done online after I was accused of being a hoarder.\n",
      "It felt awful, but it felt right, so I wanted to understand it better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you mostly looked up research articles and journals online.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "I researched articles and I researched organization things and none of the organization things seemed to fit for me [inaudible 00:36:03] something I was comfortable with.\n",
      "Hoarding just helped me understand me better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "If you don't mind me asking, why weren't you comfortable with the organization stuff you read?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "It was too cold, and cut and dried with very little emotion in it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense, a lot of them are...\n",
      "Because they don't see how it would be a problem for anyone to do it so they approach it very, this is how it is.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "That they're things, like my oldest son, \"That they're things, Mom.\n",
      "They're just things.\"\n",
      "I honestly, if you asked me, could probably sit down and in 10 or 15 minutes make a list of the things that they took out of the house that meant something to me that I miss.\n",
      "It would have no logical meaning to anybody in the whole wide world, but those things are still painful to me to this day.\n",
      "Some things I don't miss at all and I thank them for it, but I wonder what else I missed that went out that I didn't catch.\n",
      "I used to go and visit him before coronavirus, at least every couple of months if not every other month.\n",
      "We just have very, very different values.\n",
      "We love each other, we're extraordinary close, he would do anything for me and I for him, but we have such differences in priorities.\n",
      "He is much more interested in money, power, and those things are the least important in the world to me.\n",
      "I'm the most liberal person in the world, he is regimented, probably more so now then when he was as a child because as a child he was very carefree, and he was never particularly critical of me and we had a much closer relationship then.\n",
      "They live near his wife's family who's a very wealthy family.\n",
      "I was never a very wealthy person, I was a single parent raising three kids, and my husband had no life insurance and I had to work, and it was a different style of life then his wife grew up in, where it was a life of frivol where they would travel overseas and I did not.\n",
      "My parents had what they had, a summer camp and that's where we spent our summers and the kids loved it, but now it's almost a one-upmanship on his part that they bought a camping trailer.\n",
      "My definition of a camping trailer that I would buy would be something simple.\n",
      "His had to be the most complex.\n",
      "It has a fireplace, it has [inaudible 00:47:21].\n",
      "It's stunningly beautiful, but I would never spend that much money on it.\n",
      "I wouldn't spend that much money on rocks and crystals, and books and other things that I treasure, but his always has to be the best of the best, probably because when he married his wife he saw what he had missed out on with me, and felt he needed to adapt to that kind of life.\n",
      "He would say I don't have enough money and that I'm not prepared for the future.\n",
      "No, I don't have all of those things, I'd say half.\n",
      "They only have one child, specifically because they wanted to get her everything she ever wanted, and they have.\n",
      "They have beautiful dogs that are pedigreed show dogs, and the purpose is they're going to breed them and make money because they could sell these dogs for $3000, $5000 a puppy.\n",
      "The biggest dog I don't like, I'm terrified of that dog.\n",
      "It's a Black Russian Terrier, it was a military dog and it's huge.\n",
      "It probably weighs more than I do, it probably weighs 150 pounds.\n",
      "It's huge.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh my goodness, that is a huge dog.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving habits, just collecting, and hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, collecting, you're able to choose what's ...\n",
      "In my mind, choose what's valuable and keep that and let go of other things.\n",
      "I think of folks who collect rocks and they go to rock shows and they buy and sell.\n",
      "My dad, it was with birding equipment and telescopes and stuff.\n",
      "He didn't hang on and collect them all and not get rid of them.\n",
      "He traded, moved, gave away, whatever.\n",
      "Just had the ones that he specifically needed for a particular time.\n",
      "Same with rock collecting or any of the others.\n",
      "You hang onto the ones you want and trade out the ones you don't want.\n",
      "But hoarding, you just keep it all.\n",
      "Valuable or not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "What does hoarding look like?\n",
      "How is it the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, fortunately, I feel like I don't have a very bad issue with it because I can still walk around the house but hoarding, yeah, I just picture the stories you hear where it's so bad that it's physically dangerous.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I guess whether or not ...\n",
      "If they talk about always needing to get or have or you see them taking things that you know they really don't need, however, you see them, in conversation.\n",
      "At work, we can see a couple of folks who just would take things ...\n",
      "Not steal but ... I work at a church.\n",
      "Things that may be donated, they would hang onto them, whether they needed it or not or just take excess amounts whether they need it or not.\n",
      "I guess there are signs but not always.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned previously about stories you hear.\n",
      "Where have you gotten information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "What have you heard about it?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "You hear things on the news about people either dying and couldn't get into the house or you hear reports about things like that.\n",
      "That, of course, is a common theme in various TV shows, which they exaggerate everything but I guess mainly the real things would be the news reports when someone is discovered as being a hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You don't personally seek out any information?\n",
      "You just hear it when it comes on the news?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What do you think about, specifically, when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "You know, just basically, somebody who just plain cannot get rid of stuff.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "014\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So as you know, this study is investigating individual's attitudes and their beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So the first question would be, what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "You can call it anything you want.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So hoarding disorder is fine?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "That's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now we're moving on to the part of the interview that's much more conversational where I'll just ask you a question and you can respond in any way that you see fit.\n",
      "So the first one is, can you please describe your hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "I just don't like throwing things away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And does it-\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Unless they're definitely trash.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and-\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "But if they have a use, I accumulate them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so just they're nothing in particular?\n",
      "Just anything that could have a use?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how long has this been going on for?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "As long as I can remember.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how severe would you say that this behavior is now?\n",
      "Is it better than when it was when you were a child or worse or the same?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Maybe a little bit better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And why would you say that it's better now?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Because now my husband's sorting through boxes and I'm letting him get rid of somethings.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so...\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "But I don't have a lot of extra time to sort through things and get rid of what I shouldn't, so that's why everything is still accumulated from years ago.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "But you're okay with your husband going through your stuff and disposing of things?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "No, I'm not letting him dispose of it until I approve of the disposal.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "So have you ever gone to a professional for help?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "No, it's not that bad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you haven't because you don't think it's to the extent where you need to?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And I know that you mentioned that your husband has done sorting through your things, but what about your other family and friends?\n",
      "How do they feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Well, my employees make fun of me a little bit because I don't let them throw things away.\n",
      "I have a business in my home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Okay, but nothing, like no conflicts or anything?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "No, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Now, several years ago, my husband did get a guy with a dump truck to clean out the garage and he wouldn't let me help.\n",
      "So they threw away a lot of stuff that I probably wouldn't have let him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Now we're going to move on to a different section.\n",
      "I'm going to read you some short scenes and you're going to tell me if this person should try to change their behaviors if the behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist or is the behavior is similar or different to yours.\n",
      "And I can repeat these questions at the end of every scenario.\n",
      "We can start with our first one.\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no other boxes in other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized, but usually is not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yeah, probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Because, he maybe is fixing to fill that entire closet with a bunch of boxes.\n",
      "That's just a little bit neurotic I'd say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think that this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I don't think you say it requires treatment.\n",
      "He could probably talk to a psychologist even and understand why he's doing it and get over it.\n",
      "But I don't think it's required.\n",
      "I'm sure he could live perfectly normal with closet full of boxes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Would you say that this behavior's similar or different to yours?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "It's different from mine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "In what way?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I don't collect things like empty boxes or old magazines or newspapers or anything like that.\n",
      "The only thing I collect is things like music CDs and movies that I really, really like that I've liked all my life.\n",
      "My favorite movies.\n",
      "Then I do collect celebrity biography books.\n",
      "But I don't have an extensive collection.\n",
      "I just have a shelf full.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You would take less things that are more of use to you, compared to this scenario?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, there's things that I can actually probably steal if I wanted to.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I do feel a real attachment to certain objects and they bring back memories for me.\n",
      "My mom died last year and I got stuff from her, so the things that I put out that I got from her and from my dad's house feel important to me, and those are new additions though.\n",
      "But I do feel a lot of attachment to things and I kind of see it as when I was a kid we moved every year or two as I was growing up.\n",
      "My dad was in the military and every time we moved my dad would hand me one box and all my personal stuff had to go into that one box so I was always being forced to get rid of stuff, and so I feel like all through my childhood I wasn't allowed to keep things I wanted to keep, including friends.\n",
      "So, it was a very...\n",
      "That had a lot of affect on me I think, in a mode, it's making me a little teary eyed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, that must've been very hard.\n",
      "I can't imagine.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, then when I got to be in my 20s and I was living out on my own it like okay, nobody can make me throw anything away again ever.\n",
      "I'll just keep all this stuff and I live in San Francisco, you can't get me to leave San Francisco.\n",
      "It's like my home is my home and this is where I am and nobody's going to make me go, so.\n",
      "Even though my husband at one point tried to get me to move to LA and I'm like, \"Nope,\" but I'm glad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, when you think about your possessions, what makes the valuable besides maybe the emotional attachment of them?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Say that again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I said when you think of all your possessions, how do you value them?\n",
      "What makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Most of it is the memories and then the fact that it's mine, and it's interesting that I have thousands and thousands of pictures and that's one thing I was thinking I just need to go through and decide is this one worth keeping or not and just do a clear out of things like that.\n",
      "Even though they might not be a great picture, but I look at it and go, \"Oh, that's my son,\" or, \"That's so and so,\" and so it's go to do with memories and the feelings of attachment.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it sounds like a lot of how you value stuff is the emotional, like the memories, and also the fact that you possess it, it is yours, you own it makes it valuable?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "A feeling of personal power that it's mine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "How has it impacted your overall physical health?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Maybe a little worse because of having nothing better to do I smoke more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and what about your mental health or wellbeing?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I don't think it's had that much of an effect.\n",
      "Maybe a little bit more acting like a hermit, but I always was kind of a hermit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Has it affected you or your family financially?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you found any specific techniques during COVID that you found helpful because of clutter?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No, nothing special.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "Have you sought treatment, resources or some kind of professional support during COVID?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "We talked about motivation to keep these items.\n",
      "How have you kept in contact with family and friends during this time?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I've got a couple friends that I will go out and eat with maybe once a week.\n",
      "And I spend a lot of time on the computer, especially on Facebook.\n",
      "I talk to everybody on Facebook all the time, but I haven't traveled anywhere.\n",
      "There's only just a few people that I would go out and eat with because I don't want to be around most people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No, of course, yeah.\n",
      "Have the other people living with you changed during COVID?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Nobody lives with me.\n",
      "I live alone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Did you feel socially isolated or lonely before COVID happened?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Has that changed now?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you experienced any conflict during COVID 19?\n",
      "Perhaps the measures?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "You mean like ordering the people in wearing a mask?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "That's mentally an issue, yes.\n",
      "I get very upset with people that won't wear one.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah. I think a lot of orderliness might be a sign of it.\n",
      "My dad's book collection was very highly ordered, but I think there's this sense of people ...\n",
      "And I don't know, but hoarding, everything just sort of piles up.\n",
      "But in my dad's case, if you asked him about a book, out of 10,000 he would know if he had it.\n",
      "He would know where it was.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That's an interesting point.\n",
      "Yeah, certain things that maybe people care about the most are actually organized.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, now we're going to go into the third part of this.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And basically, I'm going to read you some vignettes, so some little stories, and I just want you to tell me whether or not these people have a hoarding disorder or maybe they just have a little clutter, or collectors, stuff like that.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The first one says, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but here are no boxes in other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized, but it is usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet.\n",
      "So, he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is rarely late in getting where he needs to be.\n",
      "Do you think this has hoarded?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I'm laughing to myself because I have lots of boxes, and that probably is something that's a little hard for me to get rid of, especially with all the moves.\n",
      "I'm probably going to need that box again.\n",
      "I can get some use out of it.\n",
      "But it's not ...\n",
      "That isn't too bad for me to get rid of, but ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, what do you think about this person?\n",
      "Do you think that's ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I mean, it's not significantly affecting his quality of life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "So, I would say maybe he's got some signs of it, but I wouldn't say that he's got a disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Have you ever had any serious conflicts with your partner or any of the family?\n",
      "Or have they always kind of just misunderstood you and it's been minor arguments?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah, nothing ever really serious.\n",
      "They just kind of shake their head or laugh at me.\n",
      "Because I really try to not interfere with anybody else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "With him it works out fine because like I said, we have a big half house and he knows not to go in my one room and stuff.\n",
      "But otherwise, it's okay.\n",
      "I don't know where I fall on the spectrum because I know I'm not as bad as I see.\n",
      "But [inaudible 00:16:07].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you believe your behavior's a problem?\n",
      "Why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah, it's definitely a problem.\n",
      "I definitely wish it wasn't.\n",
      "But like I said I've been like this forever.\n",
      "It wasn't a problem when I lived in the same house for a long time and always said, \"Oh, I'll get to the attic and I'll get to the room, and whatever.\"\n",
      "I was working and busy, I'm retired now.\n",
      "It became very evident when we moved, we loved in Jersey and our house got flooded in LOCATIONy, so the whole thing happened, the hurricane and stuff.\n",
      "But most of it was the upstairs so it was fine because it almost would've been a blessing had I lost a lot of stuff.\n",
      "But I didn't.\n",
      "Most of it was upstairs and in the attic.\n",
      "Then when we moved, decided to retire and move to Vermont, but I've since moved.\n",
      "I moved to a temporary place after LOCATIONy, so I had to move everything there.\n",
      "Of course, I always say, \"Oh, I'm going to go through it all and pair down.\"\n",
      "And didn't.\n",
      "So that was a nightmare.\n",
      "Then you think I'm paying to move crap.\n",
      "Then I beat myself up.\n",
      "Moving to Vermont, then I moved everything to Vermont, which was crazy.\n",
      "Then in Vermont we decided to sell our house and buy a different one just last year.\n",
      "So by then, we'd been here a couple years, I should've had everything done.\n",
      "But of course, I had to pay someone to move everything and all the stuff.\n",
      "It's just so shameful because it's stupid, it's just stupid.\n",
      "I know it but I can't.\n",
      "Everyone's like, \"Just get a dumpster.\n",
      "Why are you moving all this stuff?\" But I'm like, I have to go through it, I have to figure out what it is, I have to find homes for everything.\n",
      "It's a process and I have to do it.\n",
      "But nobody understands it and everybody thinks it's crazy and it is crazy.\n",
      "But I kind of don't have a choice.\n",
      "I don't know, it's hard to describe.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How did you find these people?\n",
      "Were they therapists or organizers?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "I would not let anybody in my house.\n",
      "I don't even let my children in the house because when I broke my shoulder several years ago they came in...\n",
      "Because I couldn't do anything, it was my dominant arm that I broke, and they cleaned my house, which meant they put things in dumpsters, they donated.\n",
      "Some things that had extreme value to me, that would have no value to anybody whatsoever, I still am bitter about them being gone.\n",
      "As an example, [inaudible 00:14:23] my son who I'm closest to that's in the military, took me to a wine stop and we made T-shirts and we did all of that, and they threw it out.\n",
      "I attempted seeing a therapist, and I was already seeing a therapist because I was depressed in part because of all the clutter and not knowing where to begin, and I don't think it really helped.\n",
      "It helped me understand reasons why, which is why I could so readily point to significant events in the past.\n",
      "I do much better if I can donate things to somebody who has a need, if I'm just filling a bag of things for the sake of filling it up and giving it away, I have pause to do that.\n",
      "But if I know that somebody my age, that wears my size clothes is in need of something because there was a fire or something like that, I can donate that.\n",
      "If there's somebody that needs kitchen things, as I said, usually I have duplicates of more things that I brought from my moms house that had sentimental value that now no longer are sentimental, they're just taking up space.\n",
      "So I would say yes, the therapist helped, an organizer was too intimidating.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned earlier that your children came and cleaned out your house, how do they feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Have you gotten in conflicts with them about it?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "My daughter was always similar to me, and she still is, other than she's doing a big clean out of her own and she realized I'm [inaudible 00:16:36] because she knows how I feel about sentimental things.\n",
      "She has all of her teaching lesson plans from 10 years ago, and she said, \"Mom, I'm never going to use these again, the curriculum is changed and it's all different.\"\n",
      "And, I went down in my basement and looked in my file cabinet and I still had things from when I was student teaching that I had created, that nobody would ever...\n",
      "Mimeographed things that were faded.\n",
      "My oldest son is a minimalist.\n",
      "He hates my clutter, he hated my clutter when he was a teenager growing up in my home and always said, \"Let's get rid of all this,\" he calls it junk.\n",
      "I call his house sterile because you could walk into it and you have no idea of what a person's personality is, or what they're likes and dislikes are.\n",
      "It's clean and perfection.\n",
      "Sometimes it feels good because it's so spotlessly clean, other times it seems like an over cleaning, I just don't like that.\n",
      "That's not me.\n",
      "My youngest son had many collections.\n",
      "When he joined the military he couldn't keep all this stuff, so he got a storage unit and also stored a whole lot of stuff at my house, and then eventually came and took some things and threw out some things as I was rescuing things from the trash that he had either made, or his old Cub Scout uniform.\n",
      "On occasion because he has traveled in the military, they're in Okinawa now, [inaudible 00:18:54] smaller there, the culture is different and it's minimalist culture, so he has adapted to less is more kind of thing.\n",
      "However, he likes the fact that if he says, \"Mom, do you have my Boy Scout shirt I want to show it to my son.\"\n",
      "Or, \"Mom, do you have that toy that I had, I think the baby would like to play with that.\"\n",
      "And, 99% of the time I have rescued such a thing.\n",
      "He is more forgiving, he doesn't like it, but he's more understanding.\n",
      "His concern would be solely my safety, if the house caught on fire, if an ambulance had to come get me or something like that, but other than that he's accepting.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I think it is genetic because, like I said to you, I look back in my family, I see some similarities in some of the people in my family of the same kind of clutter habits I have.\n",
      "And in the old days, they did it differently.\n",
      "But it was the same type of deal so it may just be a family trait.\n",
      "That's what I want to know, if it's a family trait or not, and you guys can prove that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "And I still want to know where the funding comes from.\n",
      "Who funds this and what do they get out of it?\n",
      "I can research it on the web, but you should know that.\n",
      "You should know who's funding it for your own benefit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If you have any questions about the funding too, you can email Interviewer because she's the mainly the one in charge of funding.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, I could ask her.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I know there's a couple of grants that University of Florida got, and I don't know if they were the bequest grants or if they were government grants or if they were pharmaceutical grants.\n",
      "But I would like to know where the grant money came from and for what purpose.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Those are the things in my mind that I'd like to clarify.\n",
      "I mean, it has nothing to do with me personally, but I like to know where funds come from and how they come about.\n",
      "And if it's really a good study, then it could be a real asset for all of us.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I agree.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Not just the hoarding community, but for everybody.\n",
      "And it may break into other areas where there's problems, compulsions, and things like that.\n",
      "So I'm sort of thinking pharmaceuticals are heading in this direction.\n",
      "Not that a pill is going to keep a person from collecting things, but there may be some medication coming down the tube somewhere that would keep people from collecting boxes in their bathrooms and things like that, like you mentioned.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'll get off the air.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, thank you.\n",
      "Have a good rest of the day.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "PART 4 OF 4 ENDS [01:29:34]\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how did you react to that?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Well, I didn't know what they threw away until once I asked him where the box of t-shirts were that the kids had used when they belonged to this organizations through school, I saved like a hundred of them and I was going to make a quilt out of them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, that's cute when they do that.\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "So I said, \"Where are the kids t-shirts?\" And he said, \"Oh, it went out with the dump truck.\"\n",
      "And I was mad at him for quite a while for that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And could you please describe where you live now?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "We're in a ranch house and I have a veterinary practice in the downstairs, in the walkout basement.\n",
      "And we live upstairs and our kids are all out of the house, so we have one, two, three bedrooms, and nobody that nobody is living in.\n",
      "So we have a lot of stuff stored there.\n",
      "But like I said, since this quarantine, my husband's been going through a lot of the stuff in the rooms that we've been storing so we're cleaning it up a little bit at a time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And is it easy for you to make your way throughout the house?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Pretty important.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And which objects are the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Pictures.\n",
      "I don't have a very good memory so I take pictures of everything.\n",
      "I have over a hundred photo albums.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "So I've got them all lined up on shelves and various places.\n",
      "So the pictures are the most important thing to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So the pictures are the most important?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And are there parts of your home specifically that you would consider cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Well, the two back rooms where nobody is sleeping in them anymore is where we keep most of the boxes.\n",
      "And the garage, the garage is very cluttered still, even though we had those dump trucks take several loads out, it's still cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And are they cluttered just because there's a lot of boxes in them?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "Boxes and boxes.\n",
      "When my kids were growing up, every time we had a party, company for their bar and bat mitzvahs, I would haul out things into the garage so the house would look neater.\n",
      "So the garage, everything built up in the garage.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "And I know that you mentioned that the two back rooms that aren't being used anymore since your kids moved out.\n",
      "Are there other parts of your home that you don't use the way they were intended to be used?\n",
      "Participant 014:\n",
      "No, mainly it's the back bedrooms and the garage.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "And it certainly helps, you know, over the years, it has helped me to get rid of stuff to have to go through multiple moves.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "So, it's kind of the prep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Let's spend six months getting rid of a little bit of stuff and then one month moving the rest of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Truly.\n",
      "How does your wife feel about your hoarding problem?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "She generally avoids talking about it with me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "She's aware of it, and I try to do my best that it doesn't impact her.\n",
      "I'm sure she sees the stress, but she doesn't say a lot about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, she kind of avoids it, kind of steps around the stuff.\n",
      "Has she ever tried to talk to you about it?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "A little bit.\n",
      "The hardest thing for me is my dad had left ...\n",
      "His hoarding was books.\n",
      "He had a collection ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Bugs?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "... Or on the order of 10,000 books.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, books.\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Which is an enormous number, and I've been trying to catalog them.\n",
      "That's been a very slow process.\n",
      "Kind of in my mind, I have this idea that once I've cataloged them that I can get rid of them.\n",
      "And I've only gotten through maybe about 3,000 of them, and I was able to give about 1,500 of them, that were math, technically oriented, math and physics books to one of the universities here later this year.\n",
      "To their ...Libraries don't want books anymore, but the math department actually took them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "So ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, when you say catalog ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "That actually felt really good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sure that felt wonderful.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I didn't have to throw them out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "How would you feel if you didn't catalog the rest and you just got rid of them?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "It would feel really unpleasant.\n",
      "It would feel like I betrayed my dad in some sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Do you think your dad would prefer you not have the distress and time spent doing all that?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I'm sure he would, but it doesn't change how I feel about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "No, that makes sense definitely.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I can speak logically about it, but I can't actually follow through on that.\n",
      "It doesn't change how I feel.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How has Covid affected your difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Has it made it better or has it made it worse?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, right now I feel like I can't go... I was sort of in the mode of, okay, I'm going to start taking things... I can't get to The Salvation Army to make donations.\n",
      "There was a place I could take old books to the public library, the location is closed.\n",
      "I don't want to go to the dump in my car because I don't want to go out, so.\n",
      "I did, shortly before this happened, I called for what we call a large garbage pickup where they'll pick up big stuff.\n",
      "So, I had gotten rid of some stuff out of the garage before all this happened, but all those services are pretty much gone right now.\n",
      "So, I'm just kind of feeling like I'm in limbo.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you can't really shop but you also can't really get rid of anything because everything's shut down?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, unless it'll fit in my garbage or my recycle bin it's kind of hard to get rid of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, since you've been having kind of a difficult time have you found any helpful coping mechanisms?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, one thing, I'm doing a lot of these family Zoom meetings that I set up which is kind of nice because I'm pulling in extended family.\n",
      "I'm having a lot of calls with my dad, video calls.\n",
      "My choir is doing Zoom rehearsals which are kind of weird because you can't sing together because the internet doesn't allow you to do that.\n",
      "All you end up with echo and all that stuff, but we've figured out a way around it so I've been having choir rehearsals once a week, which is nice because then we can see each other and support each other.\n",
      "So, we're finding new ways to support each other, and I'm trying to be more creative with my cooking because I'm having to do more cooking than I used to.\n",
      "We're not going out at all so I'm trying to come up with new recipes and things like that, so that's been kind of fun.\n",
      "For a while, I was trying to find new places to walk so I would get in my car and go to a new park or a new section of a park that I'd never been to once a week and walk somewhere where I had a different viewpoint because it got very tedious, you know, the same streets all the time.\n",
      "But it's like this last two weeks have been really difficult with the fires because it's like you can't get out and walk, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, you're actually just sitting at your house all day.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I'm trying to watch inspiring movies at night.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Which things or which objects are the most important to you and you spend the rest of your time with.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Well, I guess there's functional items like dishes and pans and clothes and stuff like that that you have to have.\n",
      "But then there's more sentimental things like pictures and scrapbooks and stuff that you want.\n",
      "And I think those are the things that mean more to me, but you have to have both.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So when you think of your possessions, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "How do you determine if an object has value or not?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "That's a good question.\n",
      "Sometimes I think I get too attached to things and then don't want to give them up.\n",
      "But when I really think about it, then maybe it's not so valuable.\n",
      "Sometimes it's something that I've spent a lot of money on and even if it's not useful to me, I keep it just because I spent a lot on it or somebody gave it to me, it's sentimental or emotional attachment.\n",
      "But if I step back and think, then I probably should just part with it.\n",
      "And I think it does make me feel a little better if I give it to somebody.\n",
      "If one of the kids says, \"Oh, I like that picture mom.\"\n",
      "And I'll say, \"Okay, here have it.\"\n",
      "Then I know that what I liked went to them and is still loved, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you initially value objects based on a sentimental or emotional attachment to them, but if you can step back you can maybe judge it more as how someone else would judge it based on it's monetary value.\n",
      "Is that what you mean?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's monetary value and it's usefulness to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So then what would you consider trash and what do you discard?\n",
      "When do you know it's time to throw something away or give it away?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "If it's ruined or worn terribly then that's obvious.\n",
      "For instance, we just got rid of a desk chair and it had ripped arms, but I had tried to repair it at first and then the seat was worn so badly.\n",
      "It was tattered so we just said, \"Okay.\"\n",
      "I said, \"Let's go ahead and throw it out.\"\n",
      "Which my husband of course complied to.\n",
      "But other things that aren't so bad, clothing, if it doesn't fit or if it's not the right style anymore, for me, it takes a bit, but I could get rid of that.\n",
      "So I don't know.\n",
      "And there, again, we had a table and chairs recently that someone had given us and I took it.\n",
      "My husband says, \"Why don't you take that?\n",
      "We don't need it.\"\n",
      "And so he was right, really.\n",
      "And we ended up giving them away and then that was okay rather than throw it in the trash, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "You might still try to resell some of the things that you already have because you already have them, but you're not trying to go out and find new things to sell them.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, I really appreciate your time.\n",
      "That was the questions that I have for you-\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "What is your gender?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And that's your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "What is your race or ethnicity?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Hold on one second.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you mind giving me your household income?\n",
      "It can be an approximate value.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Oh, well now I left my job a couple months ago.\n",
      "So I don't currently have income.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And in terms of the geographic region, I think you said you're in the Northeast?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, Kentucky is kind of between South and Midwest.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So we'll put you in the South.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "South.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah, Kentucky.\n",
      "It depends, I guess.\n",
      "It's one of those States that could be either.\n",
      "Okay, well let me get your address or if you would like, you can email it to me and then I'll just send it right on over.\n",
      "Is that better?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "You're so up on email, that might be the easiest way to do it.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "In an ordeal world?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "In an ordeal world, I dream of someday having the basement basically pretty empty other than your Christmas stuff and your whatever, stuff that belongs in a basement.\n",
      "So someday I would love to get there.\n",
      "This other room, I would love to have it be a real office where I could have a desk that I sit at and do stuff.\n",
      "Organized files and not boxes of stuff that I'm still going through and stuff.\n",
      "So ideally, I hope I get there someday.\n",
      "It would be really nice.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Which objects or things do you spend most of your time with?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "What do you mean spend time with?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Some people have a collection of books and they read a lot and they spend most of their time reading.\n",
      "So those would be the items that they spend most of their time with.\n",
      "That make them feel very homey.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Oh, I gotcha.\n",
      "Well, I do read a lot, I'm a retired librarian and teacher, so I do have a lot of books.\n",
      "But I'm good with books.\n",
      "If it's a book that I love and it's a classic and something that I'd refer to often, then that's on the bookshelf.\n",
      "But if I'm reading a trade paperback and I finish it, then I pass it along to someone.\n",
      "So I do love books.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I've always been very sentimental and very much a homebody.\n",
      "Even though we travel, we actually own three other homes, one in Florida, one in Mexico, and one in Oregon.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, nice.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "We do a lot of traveling.\n",
      "They're all not cluttered, which is good because they're basically our vacation places.\n",
      "So I try not to bring a lot of stuff there.\n",
      "But anyway.\n",
      "This is like main house, my home, so I love my pictures, my family pictures.\n",
      "I love anything that my son has given me over the years, anything that special people in my life have given me.\n",
      "That kind of stuff I could never part with.\n",
      "But it makes me happy to see.\n",
      "Things that I've gotten on travels, or antiques, some special things.\n",
      "I was just saying that to my mother the other day because she's downsizing.\n",
      "She said, \"Oh, I have so much stuff.\"\n",
      "I said, \"Well, things that are special to you, I think are okay to have because it makes you feel happy to see them.\n",
      "Or makes you feel good or evokes a memory.\"\n",
      "We were having that kind of a conversation.\n",
      "So stuff like that.\n",
      "I'm not a clothes hoarder or shoes.\n",
      "I mean I have a lot of clothes and shoes and things, but they're not all that meaningful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any parts of your home that you don't use for their intended purpose?\n",
      "Do you have a bathroom maybe that you just use for storage?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. Well, our guest room, we use for storage but it's not so bad that when we do have a guest it's easily cleaned out and moved around.\n",
      "We use each room for what its intended purpose.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about your kitchen?\n",
      "Are you able to use the counter spaces and stuff or would you say it's cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "It's cluttered.\n",
      "I mean, we have spots open to be able to do that but the counters are full.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "The general idea that I'm getting is that you just might have a few boxes in each room that makes it a little cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah and stuff on top, top of stuff on top of stuff.\n",
      "That kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is it like mostly papers or is it furniture or are there just boxes of items like vases or bowls or something like that?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Knick knacks.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "All of the above.\n",
      "Everything.\n",
      "Papers.\n",
      "I'm going through those now.\n",
      "Books.\n",
      "Knick knacks that I've collected.\n",
      "Things that ...\n",
      "Well, from the various places I've worked that are just sitting on boxes on top of areas and that I haven't gone through.\n",
      "I don't want to deal with it.\n",
      "It's just a lot of knick knacks.\n",
      "A lot of dust collectors.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "What about your bedroom?\n",
      "Is there stuff on your bed or are you able to use the bed and use the closet and everything like that?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Nothing on the bed.\n",
      "There are boxes on the floor.\n",
      "Closet's pretty full but everything does have a place and we can get around and everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Our bureaus are covered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like in an ideal world?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Everything straight, a lot less of the knick knacks, although I don't know how I'm going to get rid of any of them because I like them all.\n",
      "Just more straightened up.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "A lot narrowed down from what I've collected so that we can see them and enjoy them more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "That's the problem.\n",
      "I like all the stuff.\n",
      "To me, I guess you would say it's pretty important.\n",
      "I can't decide what to get rid of because it makes up the home.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "You have me at a loss for words on that one.\n",
      "I don't know, I can't decide.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "Let's think about when you said you had donated some items, how did you decide that it was time to let those go?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "I realized I hadn't used it in a very, very long time and had no intent upon using it, and I did not think any of my children would want it.\n",
      "Usually I run that by my kids, if it's something like candlesticks that I had when I got married to their dad I'll say, \"Do you want these?\" And of course they don't remember when I married their dad, my two youngest don't even remember their dad they were so little when he passed away.\n",
      "If those three things are met, then I don't have a problem getting rid of it, or if it's a duplicate of something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right, that makes sense.\n",
      "Thank you for... I know it's difficult, but thank you for trying.\n",
      "Out of the items you mentioned earlier, your rocks and crystals, your books, and your photos, what is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "I'm trying to think of what thing I would grab if my house was on fire, if I had to leave it.\n",
      "It would either be, I think it would be photos of my children.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "What would happen if you lost them?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "I would feel like somebody had hit me in the chest and knocked me out because that was the feeling I had when the kids got rid of some things that I really, really wanted and those little things that I'm still bitter about today.\n",
      "They would have no meaning, they're not significant at all, but they were to me at the moment, and that felt like I was being stabbed or robbed, something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "I think that's the most descriptive answer I've gotten so far when I ask people.\n",
      "That answered everything in when we were talking about values, so the next thing is distinguishing hoarding disorder.\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal sane behavior and what would be considered hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Hoarding would not have organization.\n",
      "Hoarding would not have logical meaning to other people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Possessions would be equated in hoarding, to safety or security.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you have anything else or do you think that pretty much sums it up.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "I think that summarizes it.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "There are plenty of things I could get rid of.\n",
      "Now part of that is as an academic librarian, I know whether an old book has any value to someone else, so that's how I figure out what I want to take to Half Price Books.\n",
      "I have a sense for what they would prefer.\n",
      "So that's how I would...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you would take into consideration the condition of the objects and the worth of it to other people?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "The biggest difference is emotional life of the person who's doing it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So their emotional condition?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And their instability, perhaps?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I don't like to think of myself as being unstable, but...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like emotionally unstable?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Unsupported.\n",
      "People who live alone, especially at old age, you really need people in your life.\n",
      "And up until I quit working, I had countless people in my life all day every day.\n",
      "Even on the weekends, I'd be out with friends or in stores and talking to neighbors.\n",
      "Most of that has vanished.\n",
      "I just haven't figured out how to replace it and the pandemic has really put a hold on moving forward with some things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "And what does hoarding disorder look like?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Really messy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Messy, overcrowded.\n",
      "I don't want to say useless, but just about every object in my house could either go in the trash or most of it could be used by other people.\n",
      "I'm looking at one of my grandmother's tea pitchers.\n",
      "I'm sure it's valuable, some antique dealer would like to have it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Well, I would think you have a pretty good idea and I've just been talking to you.\n",
      "You haven't seen my home.\n",
      "No, I don't think they have to see the home.\n",
      "I think they could listen to the person talk about, they could interview the person as you're doing.\n",
      "Yeah, they either have to see it or the person has to disclose it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Where do you get information about hoarding disorder if you do?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Well, because I'm a retired former medical librarian and academic librarian, I know how to search online.\n",
      "I know how to search Medline and the other medical databases.\n",
      "I stay up on things online.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so mostly online research?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I think, boy, you have trouble.\n",
      "Yeah, you need help.\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure. No, that makes sense.\n",
      "Has it impacted anyone else, or is it just kind of your wife that you interact with?\n",
      "Do you have any kids that it might affect?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "We have a kid now.\n",
      "At this point, no, I don't think it really affects him, other than maybe the time I spend cataloging the books.\n",
      "Maybe I could be doing other stuff, but I would say the effect is pretty minor.\n",
      "I'm pretty motivated to not pass things on to him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Can you tell me more about your relationship with your dad and his hoarding?\n",
      "Do you think that your hoarding stemmed from him, you know, you kind of growing up in that environment and seeing him have a lot of items, and you naturally saved items too?\n",
      "Or yeah, just tell me a little more about that, if you don't mind.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "Do I think ...\n",
      "I'd like to think that part of it is genetic because just about everyone on that side of the family has large collections of something, and certainly ...\n",
      "Yeah, I told you a bit about his upbringing.\n",
      "That had a, I'm sure, a major impact on it as well.\n",
      "There's very little information that I have now on anything related to his childhood.\n",
      "I mean, I might have one picture from him before he lived on his own.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, when you say his upbringing contributed to it, you're saying you really don't know about his upbringing, but you think it did?\n",
      "Or ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I know from his stories.\n",
      "He had told me that by the time he was seven he had figured out, one time, they must have moved 14 times.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "And they grew up extremely poor.\n",
      "His dad died when he was two years old.\n",
      "So, this was during the Great Depression.\n",
      "So, they just kind of shuttled around between relatives and whatever they could do to survive.\n",
      "And he dropped out of school, I think, by the time he was in sixth grade to start working.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "So, he didn't talk about it a lot.\n",
      "So, that's a little bit that I know.\n",
      "I think he kind of wanted to forget about a lot of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Yeah, naturally.\n",
      "I mean, that's tough.\n",
      "It's crazy how much time's have changed since their generation.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Isn't it?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, from not really having enough to eat all the time to now.\n",
      "We're living in totally different worlds.\n",
      "But yeah.\n",
      "So, as far as his impact on me, certainly the way that he treated ... I guess it wasn't just books cause he had records, and the old LP's classical music that he collected as well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "But even from a very young kid, I knew he'd dog ear a page, never highlight anything.\n",
      "He'd never write in a book.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "He'd carry them around on a silk pillow.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "So, I picked up a lot of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, they can be a little long but if you need me to repeat it just let me know and I can start okay.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Sounds good.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, this is the first one.\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized, but is usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "What was that last sentence?\n",
      "He barely what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, I said he sometimes has difficulties finding his keys and wallet so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them, but when this happens he's rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, does the person depicted in this scenario, do you think they have hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, they might have a mild case.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Oh, so I didn't really that fully, it's either do they have hoarding disorder or do you think their behavior is more like clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Oh, I would say it's more like a clutter problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, do you think this person should try and change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yes, if it's a problem for them.\n",
      "If he stresses about finding his keys and wallet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Probably not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why would you say not?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "It doesn't sound severe enough that he would...\n",
      "There might be other options like a group or some sort of support group or something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Other than a psychiatrist.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, last question is is this behavior similar or different from your own?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "It is similar in that I do save boxes myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is that the only way that you think it's similar?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "In-\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Because I rarely, I mean, my keys and my wallet and things like that I pretty much know where they are.\n",
      "I put them in the same place every time, so.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "And I'm weary of... I love dogs, but I'm weary around that dog because if you move to quick she'll growl or bite.\n",
      "She's not friendly, she's family protector.\n",
      "She's a fun dog they claim its a dog, but I used to babysit their dogs and their chickens, but this dog I will not babysit because I can not control the dog, and my son will not attempt to have me control the dog.\n",
      "So, little dog is a little Jack Russell Terrier that has far more energy then I could ever put forth, and I'm not allowed to babysit that one if they go away either because it's too active and I can't move that quickly as a little dog could.\n",
      "Plus, it's a very expensive dog and if she got lose [inaudible 00:49:55], if she got bred by another dog, if she got hit by a car, whatever.\n",
      "We're talking about money, therefore I don't spend as much time at their house as I used to babysitting their animals while they did this, that, and the other.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You mentioned earlier that you were a single mom and that you worked, did your behavior ever impact your work?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Oh, I've never thought about that before, but yes.\n",
      "I worked...\n",
      "It was a county wide position, but I worked in [inaudible 00:50:36].\n",
      "I was a counselor as well as a certified teacher.\n",
      "I taught adult ed programs, I counseled them, I did preschool counseling, high school counseling, it was a whole wide variety of teaching jobs.\n",
      "My desk was always cluttered, it had anything I ever needed at my fingertips.\n",
      "I knew where it was, but [inaudible 00:51:12] someone else went in my office looking for something, they could not find it.\n",
      "When I worked with special education children, my office was probably cluttered because we had puzzles, cars, sand table, an exercise bike, and all kinds of sensory sorts of things that I felt were important.\n",
      "Its definitely impacted the amount of space in the office and people would say, \"Participant 17, why don't you clean off your desk.\"\n",
      "But, yes it was stuffed, but it was stuff that I knew how to access and use.\n",
      "So, yes I felt that I was a hoarder then too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did it every affect relationships with your boss or co-workers?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Yes and no. It was always mentioned when they did the evaluation and they had to come up with something negative, it was always mentioned my desk needed to be straightened.\n",
      "However, when they asked me for information, or a report, or facts or figures, or resources, I could always access that, so visually they didn't like it, but productively it didn't seem to affect me at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Nor did it impair them because I always had what they needed.\n",
      "009\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, before we begin, I have a few demographic questions I would like to ask you.\n",
      "What is your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are you Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "What is your highest degree or level of school you've completed?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Highest degree would be high school.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is your household income?\n",
      "I have ranges so you don't have to me exact.\n",
      "So, I have up to 9,999 and then 10,000 to 19,999, and it goes on like that in 10,000 increments.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Around 100,000 a year for myself and my husband.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Which geographic region best describes where you live in the US, Northeast, Midwest, South and West?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Northwest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "As you know, this study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question would be what term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Say that again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Term, hm.\n",
      "I guess I'm kind of a keeper.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A keeper?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Keep things, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, this next part of the interview, I call it more conversation style.\n",
      "So, we're just going to be talking about how long you've been keeping things and your behaviors.\n",
      "So, can you please describe how long you've been keeping things, like how long it's been going on and when it started?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "It probably started in, I would say, my mid to late 20s.\n",
      "Once I got to the point where I had established my own space and was reasonably settled in where I lived, and then what happened was I just started accumulating things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it didn't start until you go your own place?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, how severe would you say your behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "It's bad enough that I'm concerned about it.\n",
      "It's not as bad as some other people I know.\n",
      "I had actually been in someone's house where literally you had paths that you had to go through to get from one space to another and little clearings.\n",
      "I have my public rooms I keep reasonably clear, but you do not want to go into my study, my garage, my closets, places like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Can you describe what those spaces look like?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "The cluttered spaces?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, and even other spaces.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So the next thing you briefly covered it, but we're going to talk about space and living area.\n",
      "So can you please describe like where you live now and what the space looks like?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "It's just my husband and myself.\n",
      "But when we moved in here there was the five kids with us, and they've all gone on their own.\n",
      "So we have a five bedroom house that's 2,600 square feet and pretty good sized property too.\n",
      "About a third of an acre in the suburbs and it's a colonial, so all the five bedrooms are upstairs and then it's got a basement as well, two car attached garage.\n",
      "So it's nice, but it's not super duper grand.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "And so you mentioned before that none of the doorways or anything are blocked, are there any rooms that you don't use for the intended purpose?\n",
      "Is there a bathroom that might be just full of stuff that you guys don't use anymore or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No. The other four bedrooms all have beds in them.\n",
      "Sometimes I put stuff just randomly on the bed until I can get to it.\n",
      "For instance, when I was home with the COVID stuff, I had all kinds of pictures laid out in the one bedroom in piles, and then had to clean it all up and put it away before our daughter and her three kids came last week for a visit.\n",
      "So I was able to clean it up and put it away, but I wasn't very speedy at getting the project done.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you would just say that your house is more cluttered, but it's not overrun with your items, let's say.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I would say.\n",
      "There's surfaces that things are on and I should be putting the items away, but it doesn't always happen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But you can walk freely through each room.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So what would you like your house to look like.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "A picture in a magazine, but I don't think that's going to happen.\n",
      "I guess, I would just like more of the things to be cleaned up.\n",
      "For instance, in my bedroom, I have a chest drawers and when I fold clothes, I put them on top intending to get to them later.\n",
      "And then most times that pile just sits and sits and gets added to once in a while I clear it, solve it off.\n",
      "Put it away in drawers, but probably doesn't ever get completely cleaned up.\n",
      "And I think that's because the drawers are so full and then compounds itself.\n",
      "So stuff like that just needs a better away space, put away space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what do you-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "And I don't hoard because I'm afraid that the world's going to end, or they're not going to make these things anymore, which mostly they don't.\n",
      "That could be true, but I don't hoard because of that.\n",
      "I'm not one of those type of guys who starts hoarding this because he knows they're not making that anymore.\n",
      "I have that idea that, \"Oh, I better get a couple of these now because they're not going to make them anymore,\" and I do that.\n",
      "I'll go buy five of these items because I know that they won't make them anymore.\n",
      "And if I pass them on to my grandchildren, they can make a fortune on those.\n",
      "Which some of them are going to do.\n",
      "So I guess there's a legacy in being a hoarder, but you don't want it running in your family.\n",
      "I don't want my daughter's thing...\n",
      "It doesn't help their personal relationships.\n",
      "I've already found that out.\n",
      "When they become a hoarder like me, they don't get along in the family very well.\n",
      "So it takes a certain type of personality to be able to build up the encumbrance of collections and hoarding at the same time without...\n",
      "And still be able to get along with everybody in your family.\n",
      "That's the key to it all.\n",
      "And I would say that if I'd been a really good family man and not a good hobby man, I probably would still have a lot of my immediate family around me rather than at distances on this Earth right now.\n",
      "And that's kind of strange, but that's the way things work out.\n",
      "If you have a lot of family, sometimes you don't have a lot of time to do other things than to deal with your family.\n",
      "So anyway, right now I'm at that age where I'm making all these realizations, and realize this and realize that, but it doesn't do me any good because I'm sort of over the hill.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, actually we're going to be moving on to the next part of the interview.\n",
      "And I'm going to go ahead and read you some scenarios, and then ask you some questions after each one.\n",
      "Does that sound good?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Alrighty.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So, the first scenario.\n",
      "So, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or he decides to move.\n",
      "When the items are-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Say that one again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. You mentioned that the bills you have to keep them because of necessary reasons.\n",
      "The CDs, are you keeping those because of emotional reasons?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "It's music CDs.\n",
      "I keep them because I like to listen to them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "Which parts of your home do you consider cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "All of it.\n",
      "I only have two rooms.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And you would say that they're all bills and CDs, things like that?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Are they what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Bills and CDs and just things like that?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No, the living room has got the bills and CDs, then I store clothes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The bedrooms are full of clothes, you said?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Way too many clothes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Are there parts of your home that you don't use?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "There's nothing, for example, there would be so much clutter that you can't use the stove for cooking or the bathtub to take a bath?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I've got a little tiny kitchen table that I don't use because it's got things all over it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Bread and cookies and that kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All the good stuff.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there places in your home that make it not so easy to walk around?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Parts that make me walk around?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Walking around.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I don't really understand the question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Are there parts of your home that makes it difficult to walk around?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What parts?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "The living room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and if you could, the bills and CDs?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yeah, and there's general stuff on the floor.\n",
      "Cat litter.\n",
      "Cat litter box.\n",
      "Cat toys.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "And just stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just stuff in general, yeah.\n",
      "When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Valuable to me would be if I need them or not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Valuable to somebody else would be if they work or not I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so that you determine if an object is valuable or not is seeing if it still has some use to you.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "How do you determine when something is trash?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "If I have a trash can, I guess I'll throw it in the trash.\n",
      "I don't know what you mean how do I determine it.\n",
      "Anything that's a piece of paper that I don't need to keep is trash.\n",
      "I go through a lot of cups because I don't like to wash dishes.\n",
      "I use styrofoam cups and all that's trash.\n",
      "That's part of the problem.\n",
      "A lot of cigarette butts, ashtrays, that's part of the problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how do you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Such as your styrofoam plates or cigarettes?\n",
      "Or the cat litter?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Probably on the schedule.\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "I clean up anything that's easy to clean up every day, and at least every other day, like emptying an ashtray or something like that.\n",
      "As far as vacuuming the floor and mopping and stuff like that, that's a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or he decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in and he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized, but is usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "So after this scenario, do you believe John Doe has clutter problems?\n",
      "Or do you think this is more serious behavior?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I would say he has more serious behavior problems because I never lose my keys.\n",
      "I always put them in the same spot for many, many years.\n",
      "My father did that too, by the way.\n",
      "He always put his keys and his coins on his dresser the moment he got home.\n",
      "And I watched him carefully and I took on the same habit.\n",
      "So, yes.\n",
      "But John Doe here, if he's losing his keys and can't find them, and then he has to go find those boxes in the closet and...\n",
      "Oh my gosh, I think he's got a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you think he should seek treatment from a psychiatrist or...\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I can understand saving the boxes because I do that too.\n",
      "I mean, if I take this...\n",
      "Buy a new television, I'll put the box in the garage and sooner or later that televison's going to break and I have to put it back in the box and ship it back to the manufacturer.\n",
      "So that's one of the reasons why I save the box, but there's probably a million other reasons why people do that.\n",
      "But I don't think you would need to seek help on that one if it's rationalized properly.\n",
      "On the other hand, if John Doe's putting his keys on top of his clutter every day, he may need to seek help because he can't find the keys, or he put the keys down, then he didn't know where he put the keys down and now he has to get an appointment and he can't get into his car.\n",
      "That could be a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, I'm going to read you-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "And I would say that he needs to get help if that happens three or four times a week.\n",
      "I would definitely seek help.\n",
      "So far it hasn't happened to me, and knock on wood, and I'm lucky.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Still overwhelming.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, you still feel a little overwhelmed by the presence of this stuff, and it still causes you some problems.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "And all the rent that it's cost.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you're still paying for storage units, or are you paying an increased rent?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, it's a financial burden?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Over the time that you've lived with these problems, have you sought out help, I guess, to deal with not only this stuff itself, but to deal with the kind of impulse to save?\n",
      "Have you ever gone to see a doctor about it or talked to anyone?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "No, nothing professional.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How have you sought help for the feeling of being overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that you have?\n",
      "I mean, have you turned to family?\n",
      "Have you turned to friends?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Oh, I talk to family and friends on occasion, and now I'm always spending time going through things every now and then.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it's mostly something you deal with on your own, but you will ask family and friends sometimes for help with it.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do your family and friends feel about it?\n",
      "What kind of advice do they give you?\n",
      "What do they say?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, my sister is the one who's taken on the minimalist belief, which to me it feels like the same disorder because she's trying to be so far to extreme where you're not allowed to keep anything at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, she's kind of reacted against it?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "She's reacting so extreme that it's impossible to deal with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, she's really trying to get rid of all possessions.\n",
      "She doesn't think anything is worth saving.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "She doesn't believe anyone should own anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "That's pretty extreme, huh?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "At all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has this caused conflict for you with her?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you have arguments with her about whether or not you should keep things?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I can't get help since she's that extreme.\n",
      "It's like a barrier-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "She can't help you.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... so I can't get a lot of help anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, because you know if she tried to help you, she would just get rid of all your stuff.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, everything.\n",
      "At one point I did do that once, and I threw out one thing without going through it, and then later I realized there was valuable things, which caused regret.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you tried really hard to take her advice, it sounds like, but when you did it that way, you had the experience of regretting getting rid of stuff, and so that has really made it so that you don't want to-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, it was that I threw something out without knowing what it was...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, how would you say Covid-19 has affected your motivation to maybe seek help for hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, like I said, I feel like I'm in limbo.\n",
      "There's not too much I feel like I can do about this right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But maybe not even like professional help?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, I had never really considered getting professional help for this.\n",
      "I've thought about, I mean, several years ago I went through a program that's called A Solution, and it was a... I went to it for weight loss but people go for all kinds of reasons, including hoarding, and I thought about contacting them and seeing if they have remote coaching, things like that.\n",
      "I know they do, but get signed up for something like that again, and they do have online resources.\n",
      "So, that's the kind of help that I've considered starting up.\n",
      "Excuse me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, that's sounded interesting.\n",
      "You said it's like coaching and organizers or is it like doctors?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No. It's a program, they changed the name of it and it's called EBT now.\n",
      "It used to be called The Solution, and it was a program for any kind of excessive behavior, over eating, over working, over game playing, hoarding, any kind of excessive behavior.\n",
      "And the point of the program was to get to what the underlying reasons were for why you did this and deal with those, you know, what are the root causes.\n",
      "So, it was a long program, I did it for four years where you have weekly meetings, and then in between the meetings you have workbooks that you're doing and you're calling and speaking with three other participants during the week to go through this process and figuring out what your emotions are of why you're being triggered by different things.\n",
      "It's like, \"Oh, last night I started stuffing my face.\n",
      "What was going on with me?\" So, deep diving into your past over and over again, so with the workbooks would start you'd do like the first 10 years of your life, the 2nd 10 years, and you would go back and repeat that with each workbook going deeper.\n",
      "So, it was really interesting, I lost weight but never dieted, and when I finished the program I felt a lot happier and more settled in myself, so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's very interesting.\n",
      "I've never heard of it before.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Oh. It's run by this women [NAME 00:58:09], and she's in the San Francisco Bay area, and she started off working with children who were overweight and then developed this program.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, I'm trying to see if there's any other questions.\n",
      "I think we actually covered everything.\n",
      "Let me just pause the recording.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Okay, the last one.\n",
      "John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.\n",
      "He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.\n",
      "Antiques occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet.\n",
      "So, he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "What do you think about this person?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Definitely disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Again, having trouble functioning with basic daily stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now, our last section is on COVID.\n",
      "So, I just want to know how COVID has impacted your life, just generally, and also your hoarding?\n",
      "Have you seen an increase in your acquiring, maybe because you can't ...\n",
      "You have more time on your hands, or it's an anxious time.\n",
      "Or have you been able to spend the time throwing more items out?\n",
      "Just tell me about where you're at with that?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I work from home.\n",
      "So, it hasn't had a big impact.\n",
      "The biggest is probably social.\n",
      "I haven't been able to see my friends in person.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Go out to eat.\n",
      "But we've got several ... I got a couple elderly in laws and my mom.\n",
      "So, they want to see their grandkids.\n",
      "We're pretty careful, as far as trying not to get sick ourselves by exposing them to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, it hasn't ...\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "As far as hoarding ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I think that initially it doesn't ...\n",
      "We didn't hoard any toilet paper or anything like that, but we probably did buy more stuff for the kid ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "... At first, you know, online, than we might have otherwise in the sense of now we're trapped in the house, and we've got to entertain ...\n",
      "He's now 18 months, 19 months.\n",
      "But it's like, let's get a playground set for the back yard, and let's get ...\n",
      "You know, just for him, enough for him.\n",
      "After that initial wave, if anything, it's kind of the other way.\n",
      "There's a little more time to look at stuff and to find things to get rid of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it hasn't really affected your hoarding as much?\n",
      "Maybe just getting some stuff for your child, since you felt they had to be entertained more.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But really, it's the social stuff that you feel has had the biggest impact?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I could identify loneliness, boredom, I can identify feelings, but I can't identify issues such as hoarding, unable to move forward, and so forth.\n",
      "So I didn't identify it as a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I was then embarrassed to talk to a therapist I didn't know well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "My most recent two therapists, I would have talked to, but two people back I was still working, so it wasn't a problem.\n",
      "The woman I see now, I've been seeing for a year plus.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so [crosstalk 00:27:06]\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I've alluded to it, but I've not said I want to talk about this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it goes back to familiarity and feelings of embarrassment?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know that you've mentioned pretty much every room in the house except for your bedroom and your bathroom are pretty cluttered, but what would you like your house to look like?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Oh, the way it used to look like.\n",
      "I have really nice windows.\n",
      "All of my windows were replaced 10 years or so back, and I have low light in every room.\n",
      "I would love to have people in my house again, once the pandemic is over, and I'm real friendly and neighborly and I love to talk to people and visit.\n",
      "I'm not a great hostess because I haven't entertained as much as most people do, but I do enjoy having small groups in my house and people that share interest with me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you'd like to be able to socialized again and have [crosstalk 00:28:31]\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, socialize.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And which objects are most important to you?\n",
      "I know you mentioned your books are important, but are those the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No. I have gone to arts and crafts shows since I was in my late twenties or very early thirties, and I collect pottery.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I've given away a lot, but I have some large bowls made by a wonderful potter that I got to know.\n",
      "She's a pottery professor at the college where I was.\n",
      "I don't want to get rid of those, and they take up space.\n",
      "I have a five shelf glassed in, it was a bookcase, but I've turned into a place where I keep some of my bone china mugs and teapots.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Everything in there is that.\n",
      "And then I have in a dining room, I forget the name of the piece of furniture, I have things from my mother and I have something that she got as a wedding gift back in 1944.\n",
      "I have several things that she got then.\n",
      "I have gifts from a friend from Pakistan who died two years ago and they were related to having tea.\n",
      "I collect things related to Christmas, so I have Christmas teapots, Christmas mugs, Christmas plates.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... because I didn't want to-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... deal with that stuff for anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I'm going to try to repeat back to you what you said, and you can correct me if you think that this is not accurate, but it sounds like you have accumulated this stuff, and part of the problem has been that you get anxious thinking about how much work it's going to be to go through it, and that makes you kind of avoid it, but now you're working on going through it, and you're really dedicated to the task of getting rid of it if it's the right thing to do, but you don't want to get rid of stuff if you don't have time to go through it because you're worried that you'll unintentionally get rid of something that was important.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, there have been times when something was thrown out that was important.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And that gives you a lot of even more anxiety than holding onto it.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It just caused anxiety instead of alleviating the situation.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like right now it is causing a problem in your life, both because of the anxiety and because it's a financial burden for you to have to continue to pay for storage space.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like it gets in the way of your friendships or your relationships with people in any way?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, now I can not have anyone over at this point.\n",
      "There's that issue.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it prevents you from being able to have visitors at your place?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'd like to talk about your apartment, your living space now.\n",
      "Could you describe where you're living now and what it's like?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "It's a very tiny efficiency, 430 square feet, just one room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What's it like inside?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, now I had to bring some things in from the storage unit because that was broken into, and they stole a lot of things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "So, I can't even completely trust having storage now, even though I'm paying.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "So, you've even taken things out of storage because you're worried that they'll be stolen, and they're in your apartment?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So, now there's a lot of clutter that's come back.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is it in boxes?\n",
      "Is it loose?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, it's kind of all in disarray in containers and...\n",
      "Mostly containers, but of various sizes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, mostly, the clutter is contained in various different kinds of boxes and stuff.\n",
      "What sorts of things are-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "But they're not-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "They're not currently in boxes that I can easily move from one place to another.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "So, it's not portable.\n",
      "013\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So as you know, this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having a hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question would be what term would you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "What term?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I'm not sure I understand the question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well some people find hoarding disorder offensive and they don't like to be referred with that term.\n",
      "So they just go-\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Oh. Interviewer:\n",
      "Difficulties with clutter.\n",
      "But it's up to you.\n",
      "It's whatever you prefer.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Oh, yeah, I don't care.\n",
      "I mean I always call myself a pack rat.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So would you prefer pack rat?\n",
      "Or would you like me to refer it as hoarding?\n",
      "Or?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah, whatever you normally do is fine.\n",
      "It doesn't bother me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "The next part of this is just some basic demographic questions.\n",
      "What was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "What was what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Oh, female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then what is your highest degree or level of school you have completed?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I have two master's degrees.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then what is your household income?\n",
      "It can be in a range, it does not have to be exact.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I would say just under 100,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then which geographic region best describes where you live in the US?\n",
      "We have northeast, Midwest, south, or west.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Northeast.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I have no problem getting rid of furniture that I don't use.\n",
      "Another thing I can say, going back to the question what do I collect or hoard, artwork would definitely be up there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Artwork.\n",
      "And is this ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Other people's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like friends' artwork, or ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Friends, either.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't think I have anything from people I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I don't have any Van Gogh prints ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "... Or anything like that.\n",
      "It's all work people that I know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I thought about that as something I hoard or collect.\n",
      "I'm looking at the walls.\n",
      "Got a lot of artwork on the walls.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got a lot of art work.\n",
      "Do you think that's the most precious stuff is the artwork?\n",
      "Or what do you think is the most valuable thing, like, if you were to lose it would be absolutely devastating?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "The most valuable ...\n",
      "From time to time, I've done creative writing.\n",
      "So, I would say any of that stuff would be the most valuable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "What would it be like if you lost it?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "It would be like losing a part of myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And do you think you have too much stuff, or do you think it's pretty normal?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Every time I move I think I have too much stuff.\n",
      "I have quite a bit more than my wife.\n",
      "And it's irrelevant to the survey here, but my mom and her side of the family are sort of the opposite.\n",
      "They're complete declutter immaculate houses.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What's that like, seeing that?\n",
      "Does that inspire you to clean your stuff more?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "It does, absolutely.\n",
      "It's kind of intimidating sometimes, but it's definitely inspiration and sort of envy sometimes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "It's just so easy for them to get rid of stuff, or declutter, or oh, I don't use this anymore.\n",
      "I got rid of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that envy, does that come up when you see, when you go over to friends' houses and see that their house is clean and stuff, and you wish it could be that easy for you?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "To be honest, I don't really ...\n",
      "Most of my friends, and even in school, there's nothing ...\n",
      "Even my house, outside of that room right now, it's no worse than anybody else that I know.\n",
      "But as far as ...\n",
      "It's certainly whenever, and I have moved a lot, unfortunately, is when I really notice it.\n",
      "Even with my wife, she has quite a bit less stuff than I do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "And you live with your wife?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "It's just a lot to manage.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Okay. What would you say is the most precious item for you in your house?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "The most precious?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I suppose clothes is.\n",
      "Other than that, it would be books and movies.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What makes your clothes so valuable to you?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Well, I'm just trying to think what I would hate to have to replace the most, and clothes would be expensive and hard to go shopping, so that's why I would say clothes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What do you think would happen if you lost all your clothes or gave all of them away?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Well, I wouldn't have enough money to replace them and I'd be very unhappy because I'd be wearing the same thing all over again or not have the kind of things I like to wear.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, true.\n",
      "Do you think that you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How do you know?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Because I've got more than the closet will hold.\n",
      "I've got shoes.\n",
      "Way too many shoes.\n",
      "People keep giving me clothes for Christmas.\n",
      "I keep telling them not to.\n",
      "They keep doing it, so I've got them and the closet's full.\n",
      "There's a foot locker at the bottom of the bed that's stacked high with them.\n",
      "Every drawer in the bedroom is full of clothes.\n",
      "There's a laundry basket full of clothes.\n",
      "There's always clothes on the bed.\n",
      "Dirty clothes on the floor.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "If you had to choose between your items, so let's say for example, that you throw away certain clothes and keep others, how would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "By the color and by the fit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Does your clutter issues, do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yeah, pretty much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you describe to me a time that it got in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Well, I would like to have people come over here once in a while and I really don't feel comfortable inviting anybody in here.\n",
      "And sometimes I misplace something.\n",
      "Makes it very difficult to find it.\n",
      "Lay the phone down, you can't find the phone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, all right.\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "Has it upset any of your friends or family?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it ever impacted your relationship, such as romantic?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Repeat that one.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it ever impacted your romantic relationships or your work?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So you've never done any personal research?\n",
      "It's mostly just people casually talking about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So yup, I really don't know.\n",
      "I couldn't really define it in clinical terms or anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's fair.\n",
      "This last section is kind of we'll be talking about the stress and if this behavior ever has upset you.\n",
      "Do you think that collecting all this stuff has gotten in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah, sometimes.\n",
      "I've been thinking even during this whole few months of being quarantined and home, if I didn't have a basement to go through and if I wasn't doing all this trying to get things organized and eBayed and stuff, I really would have time to be doing a lot more reading.\n",
      "I mean I'm retired, again.\n",
      "But I like to write.\n",
      "I could probably get some more writing done.\n",
      "There's other things I could do.\n",
      "But I don't feel justified being able to sit and relax and read a book or write an essay or something.\n",
      "Then when I think oh, the basement's calling me.\n",
      "So it would be nice and I do look forward to the day, if ever, that I'm done and I do have really that nice time.\n",
      "Like when we go away for the winter, because there isn't that, it's so nice, I get so much reading done.\n",
      "I take long walks, I have a lot of time to myself to do just nice things.\n",
      "But as soon as I get home, it's very yard to relax knowing that that's there and it's got to get done.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Has there ever been a time where you feel like your behavior's really gotten in the way of something you've wanted?\n",
      "Or is it more of a day to day kind of gets frustrating?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah, it's a day to day frustrating.\n",
      "There's been times where I've been overwhelmed.\n",
      "Like I said with the moving.\n",
      "This is thinking to myself and really beating myself up.\n",
      "That I can't believe you're spending this kind of money and doing this much physical labor for a bunch of junk that you're going to finally someday go through and realize what are you doing?\n",
      "But there's no way I could just have throw it in a dumpster or something.\n",
      "I would've probably gone off the deep end if I did something like that.\n",
      "Honestly, I just get stressed out even thinking of something like that.\n",
      "But there's been times where I've just been, you are just such a loser, what are you doing?\n",
      "You're spending so much time and money and hauling stuff around.\n",
      "I know it, I guess if I didn't know it, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.\n",
      "But I realize how bad it is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "So it just makes it hard.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Have you needed to seek treatment for anything hoarding ...\n",
      "Well, you said you haven't sought treatment for hoarding, but have you felt the need to because of COVID with anything?\n",
      "Or you're managing it pretty well?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Managing it pretty well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about your wife?\n",
      "How is she coping with it?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "She is more social than I am.\n",
      "So, it sure is bothering her more.\n",
      "I don't know that she's doing anything specifically to manage that, I guess.\n",
      "Having ...\n",
      "She's a stay at home mom right now.\n",
      "So, it hasn't impacted her work.\n",
      "She was finishing an internship when it hit.\n",
      "So, there was definitely some stress associated with trying to get that done.\n",
      "She's getting her master's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "But now ...\n",
      "And again, for her, it's not being able to see her friends, not being able to ...\n",
      "She wants to do sociable stuff with the kid.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Really can't do much of that.\n",
      "Can't do a lot of play dates and things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It sounds like you guys have creatively come up with some ideas to keep your child entertained, which is great.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "He's ...\n",
      "He will find something to destroy if nothing else is going on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, I think we worry a little bit that he is not getting socialized.\n",
      "It's just us most of the time or his grandparents.\n",
      "But ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, it sounds like you're handling that, and you stay in contact with your friends via Zoom, or I'm assuming Zoom or some ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... Some way.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you like ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Probably not a lot specifically that we're doing, but ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Any conflict between you and your wife or other things because of COVID or, I don't know, anything that's related?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "No. Participant 008:\n",
      "No, not ... I can't think of ...\n",
      "We've not had any fights over anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Well, that's great.\n",
      "Anything else you'd like to share before we finish up?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I can't really think of anything, although we're conscientious, this popped up into my head, of thinking about ways to identify a hoarder, or personality traits that associated with ...\n",
      "Sorry for that random thought, but ...\n",
      "My dad was very conscientious with that side of the family.\n",
      "They're all super conscientious.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, and that's an interesting trait.\n",
      "I feel like kind of what you said with neurosis and stuff like that, kind of that.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that's a great thing to add.\n",
      "Thank you for that.\n",
      "So, now we are done, which is great.\n",
      "I hope you enjoyed this.\n",
      "I definitely did.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's interesting.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, it's not something that talk about easily with anybody.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Would you say your behavior is severe?\n",
      "Do you believe it's a problem or not?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Going in and out of that through my life ...\n",
      "Now that I'm hitting retirement I'm realizing I've got to clean out and let go of stuff.\n",
      "I'm starting to work through that.\n",
      "It's an effort but I need to so I'm working on changing that behavior now.\n",
      "There are other times it's been out of control and it's difficult to deal with but right now I'm at the place of dealing with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It's gone through periods of being severe and then you've worked on it a bit?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever gone or sought professional treatment?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Not for it.\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you did go through periods of change was it kind of instigated yourself?\n",
      "Like you felt you needed to do something or did maybe your husband say something?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "At different times ...\n",
      "Right now, it's myself.\n",
      "In the past, there have been times that my husband said something or someone else has said something.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's been so many years.\n",
      "When I was a kid my mom would say something.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Then I would deal with it but, currently, it's myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned that your family has said something before.\n",
      "How do they feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Has it ever caused conflicts between you guys?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Not a terrible conflict.\n",
      "Of course, I wouldn't like hearing it or I don't want to deal with it but I do.\n",
      "Initially, resistance but never real super conflict.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It's kind of been like you might have been irritated or angry but it was resolved?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This next section is going to be talking about your space and your living area.\n",
      "Can you please describe where you live now and what the space looks like?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Where I live now?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Not like geographically.\n",
      "Like what kind of house or apartment.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "We live in a single story house.\n",
      "A number of rooms and all of the rooms have lots of stuff in them.\n",
      "I mean, we can certainly move around and things.\n",
      "It's not preventing us from using our rooms.\n",
      "Sometimes I have to move things around in order to do that but each room has lots of stuff in it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Not ....\n",
      "You know, like bookshelves and up and around.\n",
      "I do have boxes on some floors.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "It's not like you hear about where people walk in and the place is so full it falls over.\n",
      "It's not like that at all.\n",
      "It's very mild.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You would consider your home cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't have people over because it's cluttered.\n",
      "It's not straight.\n",
      "017\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And then, the first section, there's three sections to this interview, the first one's going to be basic demographic questions.\n",
      "I'll just go ahead with that now.\n",
      "What was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "And your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Sorry?\n",
      "How I identify myself or my name?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How you identify yourself.\n",
      "So we have Asian, black or African American, Hawaiian, white.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, what is your highest degree or level of school you have completed?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Master's plus 30 hours.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, what is your household income and it can be in a range.\n",
      "So, we have less than 10,000, 10,000-20,000, anything like that.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "40,000-50,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, what geographic region best describes where you live in the U.S., Northeast, Midwest, South, or West?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Northeast.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's all right.\n",
      "So, this next section of the interview is a lot simpler, because it's more conversation style and it's broken into different little subsections.\n",
      "This first one's going to be talking about behavior and treatment seeking, can you please describe your collecting problems and how long they've been going on.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "My collecting problems probably started as a result of being a child and having my mom take things that were important to me and not allowing me to have them, she would give them away or throw them away.\n",
      "So, I think that triggered me to start hiding and collecting things at a young age.\n",
      "When it got worse would probably be after I started having children because then their baby toys each held a memory for me and I took gazillions of photos.\n",
      "I have all these photos, but I'm realizing that was a problem because I was more focused on capturing all these things in pictures rather than enjoying the moment.\n",
      "I guess the next significant thing I would remember was when my mom was diagnosed with dementia, to the point where I could no longer physically take care of her because she was combative.\n",
      "I had to place her in a nursing home, and because my brother lives in California and I'm the only family member in the area, I was tasked with cleaning out my mothers house, and organizing and finding things, and mom was a hoarder.\n",
      "She had a three story house, every single closet was full of things.\n",
      "In one of the dens, I remember finding 73 coffee cans, one of which was honestly such an old coffee can that they didn't even make it anymore and it was considered an antique.\n",
      "Ironically, I always have things that people need.\n",
      "My daughter said my granddaughter's class was doing a project and needed coffee cans and I had more than enough to surprise, obviously one of the first graders with a coffee can.\n",
      "But, it was tedious going through things because nothing was labeled, I did not know the significance of it.\n",
      "When my children left home and I was alone, I was widowed very, very young, I tried to find meaning in collecting things, it gave me a way to meet up with people who had similar interests or collections, and then it got plain overwhelming.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How is this one similar or different from your own?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, again, I don't have anything keeping me from getting into my bathroom, nor do I have trouble finding my wallet and keys, and I'm always on time or early.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And this is the last one, it's a little different.\n",
      "John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.\n",
      "He goes once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.\n",
      "Antiques occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, once again, I would say, yes, he's got a hoarding problem and would need to get help from some sort of a professional, and it's different from me again in that I don't have to move things to get in and out of the bathroom or get to any other room, and I'm always on time and early.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, thank you.\n",
      "So, this will be the last part of the interview, but we basically want to know how Covid has impacted your life and impacted how much you've bought stuff or tried to change your behavior basically.\n",
      "So, the first general question is how has Covid impacted your life and what specific behaviors have changed?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, my husband and I have been in shelter in place since middle of March.\n",
      "We don't go out for anything except to get groceries.\n",
      "For a while, we were able to go out and walk so we were walking and getting some exercise because the gyms are closed, but now we've got fires so we can't go out at all because of the smoke.\n",
      "We both have asthma, so we've been out to a meal once, out to a restaurant, since all of this started.\n",
      "It's been crazy.\n",
      "I haven't been able to do...\n",
      "What really impacted me the most and I got kind of depressed was before this happened I sang in a choir that sings at bedsides at hospices.\n",
      "We couldn't go into any...\n",
      "All of the hospices closed to visitors so we can't go and do that.\n",
      "I can do weddings because all the venues closed, so I've done like four weddings.\n",
      "Normally, I would do that many in a week and now I've done that many in this last period of several months-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, my.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:46:41] outdoors and parks with like three or four people.\n",
      "So, I've lost the things that was giving my life meaning and so that hit me pretty hard.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Then the next scenario.\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or he decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He's worried he might get rid of a box he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Do you think that this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Lots of reasons, because that and eventually having empty boxes in every room and indicative of them as a problem.\n",
      "It's probably a fire hazard and you said it was making him late, so it's affecting his job and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think this kind of behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is this behavior similar or different to yours?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Very different.\n",
      "I don't have that kind of problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Now, let's go on to the next one.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "John Doe has CDs that he keeps in cases in case he needs to use it in the future.\n",
      "CDs occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.\n",
      "Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is late usually, in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "It will make sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Well, I mean, I've probably got about a hundred CDs, if that many, and they're in a little container thing.\n",
      "A little stand up shelf thing, and they're not in the way.\n",
      "I can probably have 200 of them and do the same thing.\n",
      "But if I had CDs in every room, then A, either you're talking thousands of CDs or B, somebody is just too sloppy and lazy to put them back into the shelf.\n",
      "But either way, I think they probably need some help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "You think this behavior requires treatment?\n",
      "You said yes, right?\n",
      "You mentioned that they would need to get help?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Yeah, probably.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I said to my partner the other day actually, eBay screwed up my account and then they give me this credit.\n",
      "I was like, we have this credit on eBay, do we want to buy something?\n",
      "We wracked our brains thinking there was really nothing we needed or wanted.\n",
      "So it's a great feeling to feel like that.\n",
      "I feel like I really don't, I'm so careful now when I go shopping, which is rare.\n",
      "That I just don't buy anything I absolutely don't need or am going to use or going to gift or something.\n",
      "I think I've turned a corner in the last few years, it's been a really slow process and it's going to continue.\n",
      "I get down on myself a lot because it gets really overwhelming and frustrating.\n",
      "But then I think at least I think I've broken the cycle of it.\n",
      "I try to look at is as a longterm process.\n",
      "I get criticized from people all the time and nobody in my family's like this, none of my friends.\n",
      "Nobody understands me at all and it gets very frustrating.\n",
      "But I just tell them I really look at it as a longterm thing.\n",
      "It's not going to happen overnight, but it's happening.\n",
      "It's just going to be a slow slog until I get it.\n",
      "But I've made really a lot of progress over the last few months being home.\n",
      "Quarantine has been a really good thing for me in that regard.\n",
      "My partner, we've been together like 12 years and he's the complete opposite of me.\n",
      "He's very minimalist, he doesn't keep anything.\n",
      "So I don't know how we do so well together, but we kind of have our separate spaces and our communal spaces are fine and I'm really careful to keep them clutter free and clean.\n",
      "That's how it works, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "So anyway, that was kind of a long answer, but hopefully that explains a little bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You said you haven't sought any professional help for this?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I haven't and often I've thought that I should.\n",
      "But I've never really gone.\n",
      "The only time I've done any kind of counseling is after my husband passed away 14 years ago.\n",
      "That was just really hard, so I went to grief counseling.\n",
      "Then I was involved in politics for a long time and that was really hard.\n",
      "So my grief counselor, once in a while I would go and see him again just to talk through some special situations.\n",
      "But other than that, I've always kind of thought I should, but I don't know.\n",
      "I seem to be doing okay on my own, but probably would be helpful because I really don't have anyone to talk about it to.\n",
      "No one understands.\n",
      "Honestly, it's wacky.\n",
      "My mother especially criticizes me all the time.\n",
      "But then she constantly gives me stuff.\n",
      "In fact, my partner's daughter just came up, we live in Vermont, she came up from New Jersey.\n",
      "My mother loaded her car up, she just got here an hour ago, with stuff.\n",
      "Just because she's cleaning out her stuff, to give me.\n",
      "I'm like, why are you doing this to me?\n",
      "It's like giving drugs to a drug addict.\n",
      "I'm trying to get rid of my stuff\n",
      "But then she'll mock me for, \"Oh, you have so much stuff and what are you ...\" I don't get it.\n",
      "So that's what I'm up against.\n",
      "But then she'll mock me for, \"Oh, you have so much stuff and what are you ...\" I don't get it.\n",
      "So that's what I'm up against.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I'm going to go out and pick some plums today and see if I can give them to the family down the road at the Good Samaritan.\n",
      "I'm trying to break my isolation so doing the best I can.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Has COVID affected your motivation to seek help for clutter, or have you ever seek help for hoarding before?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "No, I've never seeked help for hoarding other than I have some in the family take some things away that they want.\n",
      "Like I mentioned, I'm trying to get that more and more so now.\n",
      "And COVID's actually kept the family from coming and visiting me so yeah, that's been a detriment.\n",
      "I can't get the family to visit me either because they can't get out of where they are, the weather's been so bad, now we got fires out here that are burning everything up, and the roads are closed.\n",
      "Oh my goodness.\n",
      "One thing after the other.\n",
      "No, it's been difficult and I imagine it's going to be difficult for a while.\n",
      "So hold your horses as my dad used to say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So that's actually the end of the interview.\n",
      "So thank you for completing this interview with me.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, I'm interested.\n",
      "What is the COVID part of this?\n",
      "How does that fit into the research?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's just to see if there's any new information or new data we can collect from pre-COVID and during COVID just to see how COVID affects the data.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't think it's going to affect us hoarders that much because I think a lot of hoarders would feel comfortable in their hoarding stuff around them, like I mentioned earlier.\n",
      "I don't feel that comfortable but a lot of hoarders do.\n",
      "Some hoarders may even be more hoarding after the COVID.\n",
      "So it'll be interesting to see how that affects hoarding people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "It may make them worse.\n",
      "So if you can get some data in there to qualify, that would really be interesting.\n",
      "Is there any chance I can ever get to see the results of these surveys?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, actually.\n",
      "So at the end, I can let Interviewer know.\n",
      "She can send you data once it's all completed and we're able to send out the data.\n",
      "So yeah, I'll let her know that for you.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "And another thing, they mentioned that they were going to pay me for this.\n",
      "Well, I wasn't real enthused about that to begin with, but if they do, could they just add that to the gift card they gave me previously?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just like really the care for the items, kind of.\n",
      "That's actually interesting because seeing someone take really good care of their items, that obviously shows that they value them more, which in turn taught you to value items more.\n",
      "Which, probably then, had you pick that up, start hoarding and stuff.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Very interesting.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Let's see, what was my next question?\n",
      "I guess, now I kind of want to differentiate between a collector and a ... I don't like saying \"hoarder,\" but someone that hoards.\n",
      "I guess, my question is, what is that line for you?\n",
      "What do you think differentiates those two?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I think of collectors ... I have a friend that collects a lot of stuff.\n",
      "So, I'm going to try to relate it back to him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "He'll collect something for a few years, and then when he's done collecting it he'll just get rid of all of it.\n",
      "It's no skin off his back.\n",
      "It doesn't' bother him in the slightest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "And the stuff that he collects, there's some value, like with comic books, or he's collected Matchbox cars for awhile.\n",
      "Right now, it's games.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, he goes through the effort to collect all this stuff and then just gets rid of it?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, the fun for him is in the collecting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And then just sells it all?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, and he'll often make money by doing it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Hopefully.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, I'm sure not always.\n",
      "That's not really why he does it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "But he gets a lot of pleasure out of collecting and acquiring it but not really having it.\n",
      "And I think in my case, and my dad's case, it's in having the stuff.\n",
      "It's not in the acquiring or collecting it so much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, this ...\n",
      "Your friend, it's more kind of like a game, kind of like a hobby, and for you it's having those items that represent family ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... And connection.\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Is there a way to tell if someone has a hoarding disorder without being in their home, do you think?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "I would that ...\n",
      "Yeah, I'm sure there's some connection to obsessive behavior, that sort of anxiety, or that ...\n",
      "I'm not a psychologist.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "You know, I've coming from maybe a pop-psychology perspective, but I think it would ...\n",
      "People that have higher anxiety ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "... I think would be more likely to hard or collect stuff.\n",
      "They're more neurotic, I guess.\n",
      "There's probably ...\n",
      "Cause I guess personality traits and if you know how they view certain things, or we were just talking about it, they treat stuff ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How do you know when you have too many possessions or items?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I guess when they can't just be organized easily.\n",
      "My closet is too full and I know I have too many clothes.\n",
      "So I have been reading through them.\n",
      "Things that have a stain or a rip or not, or they're just not whatever, I'll put in the bag and then next time we're passing a clothes bin.\n",
      "That's the thing here, we don't have a lot of Goodwills and Salvation Armies and stuff there.\n",
      "Like when we go away for the winter to Florida, they have tons of that kind of stuff and it's very easy.\n",
      "But I have been selling, actually I've been selling clothes on this website called Poshmark, which is a newer website.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, yeah, I know of Poshmark.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah, it's great.\n",
      "It's really focused on clothes and that kind of stuff.\n",
      "So been selling a lot of clothes on there, which has been great.\n",
      "I think when I get to the point where my closet's overflowing and I can't find anything, or my bookshelves are too full, and I have to start weeding out.\n",
      "I mean my mother always used to say that when I was a kid, a teenager, I'd be like, \"If I only had a bigger room, it wouldn't be so messy.\"\n",
      "Then she'd put me in the bigger room in the house and then it would still be messy.\n",
      "Then I'd say, \"If I only had a smaller room, then I'd have to be more organized.\"\n",
      "Then she'd move me back to the smaller room and it would be messy.\n",
      "So I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This is kind of a little bit different, but what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Well, I think you can be perfectly normal collector, if you collect certain things.\n",
      "As long as you have a place for them and they are significant in some way, they have a usefulness or they just make you happy.\n",
      "But I think it becomes hoarding when it gets to be so much that you can't keep it organized, it takes up too much room in your life and your house.\n",
      "I think if you're literally keeping things that are just, like we were saying, trash and doesn't have a function, I guess there's a line obviously between normal collecting and hoarding, for sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I think I'm somewhere in the middle.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, it seems like you have all ends of the spectrum within your children on how they feel about it.\n",
      "One's completely against it, one has your behavior, and the other one is concerned for your health and safety, but understanding that sometimes it's nice to be able to find something because you have it.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Like I said I'm so good at using... I was a writer for [Currator 00:20:16] Times.\n",
      "I could write articles for you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm not a writer at all, I'm not very good at being detailed.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "You're probably not a hoarder either.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I don't know, I keep on to some things, but we'll see.\n",
      "So you mentioned that you live alone, what does your space look like.\n",
      "You said it was cluttered, but are there rooms that you can't access at all or is it you're not using for their intended purpose?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "There is one room that's supposed to be the library and that's filled with stuff, in addition to, books that don't fit on the shelves.\n",
      "I really can't use that room, there's a pathway from one end of the room to the other, but to be able to walk around in there, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So most of the things that make you feel at home are the pictures of your family and then stuff you've collected from traveling, like antiques and stuff like?\n",
      "That's what makes it homey?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah, things that are special, that have significance.\n",
      "Not just a bunch of random objects, things that have significance.\n",
      "From family or travel or growing up or memories.\n",
      "Things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So when you think about your possessions, how do you determine their value?\n",
      "Or if they're valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Just for their meaning, I think, what they mean.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I really would have trouble letting go of stuff if it was stuff from my late husband say, or like I said, my son or my mom or people that have been always special to me.\n",
      "I would have trouble getting rid of anything that came from them and had something to do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you value things based on their sentimentality, sentimental attachment to them.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Not value like monetary, that doesn't really bother me.\n",
      "I don't ... yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you consider trash?\n",
      "How do you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "I guess if something's broken and can't be fixed.\n",
      "The funny story, I have this big pottery canister which I've always loved and I broke it.\n",
      "I dropped it and it broke.\n",
      "I was like, jeez, maybe somebody could still do something with this.\n",
      "I hate to just throw it away.\n",
      "It's kind of just been sitting here.\n",
      "Then I saw on one of the neighborhood forums that a woman is making mosaics and she's like, \"Does anyone have any broken pottery or whatever?\" I sent her a picture, so I'm going to meet her on Friday and give it to her.\n",
      "I was so happy.\n",
      "Like oh this isn't going to sit in a landfill now.\n",
      "Somebody's going to use it.\n",
      "But no, seriously, if something's truly broken and can't be repaired and has no value left for anybody, I'm okay with it going in the garbage.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "When I read a newspaper, I recycle it right away.\n",
      "I don't keep anything that I'm done with.\n",
      "It's funny, living in rural Vermont, it's a totally different attitude than growing up at the Jersey shore.\n",
      "People here really do reuse, recycle, repurpose.\n",
      "There's free boxes on the side of the road all the time because people don't want stuff, they just put it out for free.\n",
      "It's a very thrifty area and there's nowhere to really shop, which is good for me, it's been good for me because there's really nowhere to go.\n",
      "So that helps.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Then of course there's times when I'm just like, oh, my gosh, shut that door.\n",
      "My one room that's just full of stuff.\n",
      "If somebody comes in and my bathroom's right next to that.\n",
      "If they want to use the bathroom, I'm like, oh, my god, if they looked in there, I would die.\n",
      "That's no way to live, that's just stupid.\n",
      "But thank god I do, I am very grateful that it's not the rest of the house, that I have kept it in check enough.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned earlier that you had just gotten rid of something without really knowing what it was, that it would really upsetting.\n",
      "Has there ever been a time where someone just kind of gone through your stuff and got rid of something without you knowing?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah, that's happened, especially with my mom years ago.\n",
      "I often think that that's maybe when this started.\n",
      "When I was a kid, she got rid of a couple things that were from my great grandmother who I was very, very close to.\n",
      "It was like this quilt that she had made me and this little bench that she gave me that I used to sit on.\n",
      "My mother just, I don't know, she just randomly threw them away one day.\n",
      "I always, still to this day, picture them in a landfill and I can't believe she did that.\n",
      "Then when my grandmother died, it was only a couple years later, because I was still young.\n",
      "She didn't let me go to the funeral.\n",
      "Still to this day she'll say, \"Oh, your great grandmother, do you remember her?\n",
      "She was whatever.\"\n",
      "I'm like, of course, I remember her.\n",
      "I used to spend every weekend with her.\n",
      "It's weird.\n",
      "My mom dismisses the fact that I was close to her and had anything to do with her and I don't know why I never got closure after she died.\n",
      "I mean I was in 6th grade I think, so I was what, 11 or something.\n",
      "I was old enough to have dealt with it.\n",
      "It was still brushed aside.\n",
      "So I kind of think that's maybe, sometimes when I really think about it, I'm like, I wonder if that's where all this started?\n",
      "Then through the years, like when my son was little and you're a young parent, you get overwhelmed.\n",
      "She would come over and babysit and I would home and be like, \"Where's this?\n",
      "Where's that?\" She'd be like, \"Oh, you didn't need that.\"\n",
      "It's way happened over.\n",
      "Even when I first met my partner and we moved in together, and then I noticed that he had gotten rid of a few things.\n",
      "Then I finally had to have a talk with him, \"You just can't do that.\n",
      "That sends me into a frenzy.\n",
      "If you really think it's something that we don't need, then talk to me about it and I'll deal with it.\"\n",
      "But it's almost like I have to do it myself if I'm going to get rid of something.\n",
      "I can't have anyone do it for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Especially without me knowing.\n",
      "Then I find out, oh, my god.\n",
      "Very stressful.\n",
      "And I hope we'll see what happens when the vaccine gets here next year maybe, if it gets here.\n",
      "I'm keeping my fingers crossed that everything will get back up there, but I'm a little pessimistic in the long run.\n",
      "So unless I was a billionaire, which I'm not, and I wouldn't want to be a billionaire because I couldn't manage all that, financially it upset me.\n",
      "And I think it upset most people financially.\n",
      "I can't see why not.\n",
      "And to make things worse, everything has gone up in price.\n",
      "I'm just out there buying some stuff on the internet today that I can't find locally, and the price is almost doubled so there you go.\n",
      "Your experiences too, my dear, so it's not just me.\n",
      "We all are experiencing this and which means the dollars are getting really stretched.\n",
      "It's good to have a little money in the bank, I guess.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "The COVID thing, this is going to be interesting to see if it straightens out after we get the vaccine.\n",
      "I hope to God it does, but there may be something worse that'll come in and make it even worse.\n",
      "So who knows?\n",
      "We can't predict the future.\n",
      "We can only try to protect ourselves in the present.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, that's true.\n",
      "How have you been coping since COVID?\n",
      "How has it been seeking comfort or any techniques you've found helpful?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yeah, I do.\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "I found some exercises that I like very much, but everybody else is starting to clue in on those things too.\n",
      "You start doing something that's good for you and other people hone in on it.\n",
      "But yeah.\n",
      "No, it's not that we're all dancing together again, but maybe that'll happen in the future as long as we keep our six feet apart.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, has COVID-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I'm very positive about the way this is working out.\n",
      "I mean, I think people are getting used to the COVID and we all wear our masks at restaurants and whatnot, supermarkets.\n",
      "So that seems okay, but people want to get together.\n",
      "I can see that.\n",
      "And when you got large families, you got to be really careful if they're all in the same house together.\n",
      "I don't have any of my family right around me.\n",
      "They're all either different countries or different states so that's difficult.\n",
      "The other difficult thing is I can't travel right now other than driving.\n",
      "I don't like driving a lot so I have to have people with me when I drive.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "How has-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I'm sort of bound to where I am here in this state.\n",
      "I can't go back East or drive back east right now so we'll see what happens.\n",
      "It's a little difficult for all of us.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Has COVID affected your sense of isolation or loneliness at all?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I told you it's making me more isolated.\n",
      "It's terrible.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, while you would like to change the fact that you have all of this stuff, you want to change it in the right way.\n",
      "You want to go through it and make decisions about what you're going to keep and what you're not going to keep?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you had to just get rid of some of your stuff, that would be really upsetting to you?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "If I don't need it, it wouldn't be.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you don't need it-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Because I don't need it\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If you know that it's something that you don't need, you can get rid of it.\n",
      "That doesn't bother you, but the idea of getting rid of stuff without knowing that it's not important, that really bothers you.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I guess.\n",
      "Is that wrong?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Are you saying I should be?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, no. I'm trying to understand how you feel.\n",
      "There is no right or wrong answers here, for sure.\n",
      "No, it makes total sense to me what you're saying.\n",
      "Again, I'm just going to try to say it back to you.\n",
      "So, it sounds like the amount of stuff bothers you.\n",
      "The amount of stuff in a small space bothers you, and having to pay all this money to store it bothers you, but you definitely don't want to just get rid of stuff willy-nilly without having the opportunity to decide what it is you're saving and why, and so the main-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, because when I tried that once, then I later had regrets.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You really regretted it when you didn't have a chance to go through it, so are kind of slow-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right, and then I was asked about things, \"Where's this?\n",
      "Where's that?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you were like, \"Well, I don't have it anymore,\" and that was very upsetting?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, and it was also other people's things that they could've used.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes total sense.\n",
      "I kind of want to close out by asking you how you have been affected by this whole recent situation with the COVID pandemic.\n",
      "Has that affected your life at all?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Some things I wanted, like books I wanted to hand off, the establishment had been closed, so I haven't been able to [crosstalk 00:46:39] hand things off to [crosstalk 00:46:41]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, a public library or wherever you're taking your books, you haven't been able to go and do the drop-off.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "I know those places have been closed.\n",
      "Have you found yourself acquiring more stuff because you're worried that there will be scarcity?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Only some food items, but I do try to eat things before they expire, that sort of thing.\n",
      "016\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so as you know, this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So the first question I'd like to ask you is what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "The first thing that came to mind was disorganized or disorganization.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like disorganized?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Because I know I'm not a hoarder, but I just never get around to finishing stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "And every room is full of unfinished stuff and things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I guess I don't care.\n",
      "Use hoarding.\n",
      "I don't use that, but that'll be okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, we can just go with problems with disorganization, that's fine.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that's a great list.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "So now we're going to be moving on to the next part of our interview that's a little more conversational.\n",
      "The first section that we're going to be talking about is your behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "Could you please describe your problems with clutter for me?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Essentially, I'm a very neat, organized person, and that's how I lived my life until I was 70 years old.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "And my life's work was being a librarian in large research hospitals and in a college environment.\n",
      "Those are highly organized places, and I functioned every day by organizing ideas, items, things.\n",
      "I'm just stunned and shocked that I could move from having lived my life up to age 70 and to have changed so much by age 74.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative) Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I think what comes to mind immediately is my financial difference.\n",
      "I'm living on about a fourth of what I made when I was working in my later years.\n",
      "That's because I didn't understand money and didn't save enough money.\n",
      "I spent money on things that I wanted, clothes, toys, art supplies, those kinds of things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you've been saying that this has been happening for the past four years?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and how severe would you say this behavior is now compared to four years ago?\n",
      "Has it gotten better or worse?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "It's much worse.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and is that because of you being on a budget and having less financial income?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, because if i had that income, I could higher people to clean.\n",
      "I could even higher people to organize, because I would rather do anything else at this point.\n",
      "I'd rather read, or lay in the yard, or play with my art supplies, or go out and see friends, so forth, but I feel trapped by the lack of money.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No way out of this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there a lack of motivation to do it yourself?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I'm overwhelmed at this point, because I don't even know where to start.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "Have you ever sought treatment for hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "No, I haven't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You haven't.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is that something that you'd be interested in doing or have thought about?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's not something I've thought about a lot, but I probably have some interest.\n",
      "I would not be interested in any kind of medication but maybe therapy or something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now, I'd like to ask you about where you live, the space.\n",
      "I know you said it's about three, clutter volume on a one to 10 scale, but can you tell me more about it?\n",
      "Do you live by yourself?\n",
      "Is it a big place?\n",
      "Is it a small place?\n",
      "Where are your items?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It's a pretty large place.\n",
      "Most of what I have is either in closets or bookcases.\n",
      "There's one room that is maybe 70 or 80% full of stuff.\n",
      "Then the rest of the house, I would say, it would look kind of normal.\n",
      "It certainly wouldn't stand out as having clutter, but that one room has quite a bit of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it sounds like maybe your storage room or something like that, and the rest looks ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... Pretty normal?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "When you say ...\n",
      "Okay, so you have some closets.\n",
      "You have some stuff like that.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Are there any parts of your home that you don't use at all because of the clutter?\n",
      "Or is everything pretty manageable, utilities, stuff like that?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, outside of that one room, everything is manageable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "And is that a bedroom?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "It's kind of an office.\n",
      "It's the smallest roo in the house.\n",
      "It would be a bedroom, but it doesn't have a closet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "It's meant to be an office.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Are there some items that you value more than others?\n",
      "What kind of items do you keep?\n",
      "Are there some, yeah, just some that you keep more than others?\n",
      "Or is it kind of stuff all across the board?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Books, and papers, and then gifts, stuff that was given to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gifts.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Whatever it happens to be ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "And when you say papers, are these, for example, your school papers and stuff like that?\n",
      "Or is it just kind of banking statements or random things?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "School papers, notes, work papers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And books ...\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I have a filing cabinet for all the financial stuff.\n",
      "That's not out of control.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's probably a good thing to keep, perhaps.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It doesn't provoke anxiety to get rid of any of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Connection to either my past or to other people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then, what is trash for you?\n",
      "So, what are things you have no problem getting rid of?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Financial papers, probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "... Very well, like carrying books around on silk pillows, so to speak.\n",
      "If you observe behaviors like that, maybe you could identify.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:41:20]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you think of some personality traits?\n",
      "What are some personality traits, you think, that would maybe give you an idea of that?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Maybe if you have views that nothing should ever go to waste or trying to find utility in everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Do you think that, on that idea of waste, see this in people that struggle with the same stuff, is that kind of Great Depression Baby Boomer mentality.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "Cause you really to ...\n",
      "After all that, it made sense to save all your items.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "Cause that was a very scary time.\n",
      "Do you think that will kind of decrease as the generations go on, and maybe decrease hoarding behaviors?\n",
      "Do you think it really won't make a difference?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, I don't know that depravation alone causes it.\n",
      "So, I don't know that if it'll become less frequent or not.\n",
      "It is less severe for me than it was for my dad, there's no question about that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "But it's still there.\n",
      "So, maybe there'll be fewer severe cases, but I think there'd still probably be a lot of people that hoard.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "And maybe ...\n",
      "I'm not qualified.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "But if people are feeling more disconnected in the modern world, and there's more stress, or isolation maybe there's going to be more hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "And certainly to even acquire stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it's been interesting with COVID too, how that's changed, which I do have ... I will ask you those questions too.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Oh okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, any other way, do you think, to tell that someone is hoarding without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I guess ... I listed personality traits.\n",
      "I think for the cases of this study, I mean, I was identifying by a psychological screening test.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "So, I think that would work, or certainly probably worked in my case.\n",
      "As far ... I guess is the question directed more at clinically, or is it directed more at just casually ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I mean, just a question.\n",
      "And if you can't think of anything else that's fine.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, just I wonder when folks interact, like, if you're interacting with someone if you'd maybe ...\n",
      "You know, you kind of get a sense for people, or there's certain things that you could clue into that might lead to it.\n",
      "But you said a lot of stuff: anxiety, maybe how people treat their items, personality traits.\n",
      "So, that makes sense to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, it sounds like mentally you've been a little more done and financially you're not able to work as much either?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "But financially it was okay because I was semi-retired so I have my pension income.\n",
      "The wedding money was just like pin money.\n",
      "I did it more because of the gratification and it was so wonderful to work with these couples as opposed to needing the money, so.\n",
      "So, it's not a financial issue, it's feeling that I have purpose.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it sounds like mostly it's been hard on you mentally-\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... it's been causing more depression and stuff?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah, emotionally and mentally it's been difficult.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, but physically your health overall is good?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I gained weight.\n",
      "I've gained 10 pounds so I'm stress eating a bit more.\n",
      "Other than that, my health has been okay except these last two weeks with all this smoke.\n",
      "That's hit me, that's why I'm coughing a bit and stuff.\n",
      "Otherwise, my health is fairly good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has Covid affected your shopping habits?\n",
      "Or has it helped-\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Whereas I used to enjoy browsing the grocery store and looking at the fruits and vegetables, now I order everything online and I go and they deliver it to the trunk of my car.\n",
      "So, now I have a once a week online shopping experience.\n",
      "I'm not going to even the drug stores, I order everything online through Amazon like vitamins, all the stuff that I would've gone and... I live in a walking neighborhood, so I used to walk everyday like four blocks down to where my shopping street is and wonder up and down and look in the store windows and maybe go in the book store or something.\n",
      "So, now I'm doing everything online.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about for other shopping, like you mentioned books or art supplies, other things that you collect, how has that affected that?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Oh, I'm not collecting anything right now.\n",
      "My purchases are all things I need.\n",
      "I mean, even underwear I bought online.\n",
      "So, I'm not really doing any shopping for anything that's like what I consider fun stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, Covid-19 has kind of stopped your shopping other than the necessities?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's funny, I was never a shopaholic or anything but I always like to browse, and I do love bookstores so if I went into a bookstore I always came out with something.\n",
      "So, now it's I have to be more thoughtful about, you know, I read the book review, do I want to read this?\n",
      "I can't get it at the library anymore because the library's closed so I have to either buy it either as an online copy or order it from a bookstore and go pick it up.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Although, I would be able to move things a little at a time in a vehicle, if I can put them somewhere else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it's hard to move your stuff around in the way that it is currently stored?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What sorts of things are in your apartment right now?\n",
      "What sorts of things are causing clutter?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, it's the things from storage like records, and then the electronic cables and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, records, electronic cables?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:20:10]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sorry?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "A lot of clothes and miscellaneous.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, clothes, miscellaneous things.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think that your living space right now is comfortable?\n",
      "Is it comfortable for you?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "No, not right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would a comfortable living space look for you?\n",
      "How would you like your apartment to look?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I would like to move to a place that had enough space to organize it.\n",
      "I would like to have everything organized.\n",
      "Anything I have I would like to be in one particular container or shelf, like each item separated...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it sounds like...\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... and then I can see whatever I don't need.\n",
      "I could figure out some other place where it could go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it sounds like the problem with your apartment now is that you don't have the space to be able to see what you have, and so it's keeping you from getting organized because everything has to stay in the containers, and that prevents you from even knowing what's there and being able to go through it.\n",
      "So, ideally, you would like a space that's...\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Actually, I do kind of know what is in the containers, but there are occasions where I do not know where something is or if I still have it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And that causes anxiety?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, an ideal apartment for you or an ideal living space would be more space than you have now, and it sounds like ideally, I would have this space to have everything laid out in an organized manner, in its proper place, and have all of your stuff-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, and then I would also be able to reduce what I have because then I can see what I have too much of or what I don't need, and then I could either try to give it away or sell it or whatever.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, your ideal living space would be bigger and would allow you that organizational room?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah, and I wouldn't have to have a storage unit because I would have everything all in one place.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you prefer to have all of your items in your home?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did he ever get upset about not having storage area?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No, he never... because he had his room, he had his closet, he had plenty of space.\n",
      "He was actually somewhat of a slob when he was a kid.\n",
      "I remember one of my friend's came over to help my son with his computer and he walked in his room and was like, \"What?\n",
      "You can't see the floor.\"\n",
      "I'm like, \"Okay.\n",
      "Teenage boy, what can I do?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, it never impacted your relationship with him at all?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, for this next section what do you figure the most important differences between what is normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, I would think collecting is you're collecting things that you love, you're passionate about, that add enjoyment to your life, and that are decorative or useful, for example, my egg cups, I use them.\n",
      "Hoarding is keeping things that you really don't need that just contribute to clutter and don't give you any kind of happiness or joy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, we touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you expand on what you think hoarding looks like and how it is the same or different from your own behavior?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, I would say I am a hoarder because I am keeping things that are not necessary or useful or don't add joy to my life and that is visible.\n",
      "When I look at my desk or open my closet door, it's something you can see.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, do you think there's a way to tell that someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Maybe there are.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, where else have you hear about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "So like-\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:36:23] Where else?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, where do you get your information on it?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "In the news media, in magazines, and I remember when I did encounter this friend who had a really severe problem that I kind of did a little nosing around about it.\n",
      "So, you can find information on the internet and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you mostly just seen it in the news and read about it a little bit?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, and one last thing, you mentioned that you officiate weddings, right?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you said your behavior never affected your work, right?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, just wanted to make sure that was what I heard, okay.\n",
      "So, this next section, they're going to be call vignettes, so basically I'm going to be reading you little mini scenarios and then I'm going to be asking you some questions about them, okay?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, it sounds like it's been throughout your life that this has been going on.\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so how severe would you say this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "To you, because I'm being honest, I would say it's severe now because I've been...\n",
      "Before Covid, I was in the process of being diagnosed with MS, and I have a vision issue where it's destroyed the optic nerves so I have difficulty seeing squarely.\n",
      "Because of not feeling well so frequently, and some days not being able to get out of bed because I'm just plain too tired, things have piled up to the point where I would say you can not walk easily through my house.\n",
      "I would say to someone who came in that, \"I've left clutter here because it helps me perfect my balance.\"\n",
      "Which in fact it does, if I had to step over and to the side.\n",
      "I would say it's probably a serious problem now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'm really sorry that's happening to you, but thank you for your honesty.\n",
      "So, you mentioned before the Covid and pandemic started that you were changing your behavior and cleaning out, have you gone to professional help for this?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Numerous times throughout my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. How do your family and friends feel about your cluttering?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "I think they understand that I don't invite people in because I don't particularly want them to see my house.\n",
      "I've got a tiny little condo, way too much stuff in it, as most people would in a one bedroom condo.\n",
      "I've got a sick cat and I've got COPD.\n",

      "Have you ever had any problems with family, friends, or people close to you or even landlords about your cluttering?\n",

      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Please describe where you live now.\n",

      "Okay.\n",
      "Does this home look like the way that you want it to?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, what would you want to change?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "Well, there's too much stuff, but the problem is I need the stuff that I have.\n",
      "I just got a tiny little place.\n",
      "I work from home, and I work with computers, so I've got a lot computer stuff.\n",
      "Too much paper.\n",
      "I don't know that you'd call that hoarding, I'm just too lazy to go through it and throw it away.\n",
      "It's not that I want to keep it, but I got way too much paper and bills to throw away and I smoke, so there's nicotine on the walls and stuff.\n",
      "I wish that was not so, but it is.\n",
      "Basically, I'm just lazy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "A lot of clutter.\n",
      "How important is your clutter for you to feel at home?\n",
      "If you were to throw them away, do you think you would feel less at home?\n",
      "Participant 010:\n",
      "No. If I could go through all this junk, throw out what needs to be thrown out, I'd be very happy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you have certain objects that are more important to you than others?\n",

      "Probably my bills, and they need to be gone through, by the date and stuff.\n",
      "I was, well, I'm actually self employed, so there's a certain amount of that stuff I have to keep and being in a one bedroom apartment there's not much of a place to keep boxes full of bills.\n",
      "And I have a lot of movies.\n",
      "I don't really want to get rid of them and I've got right many in these CDs, which are all in shelves.\n",
      "I would want to keep the CDs.\n",
      "There is a lot of piles of that stuff that needs to be gone through and thrown out.\n",
      "That would be it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. No, I get it.\n",

      "How big is your house?\n",
      "How many rooms are in it?\n",

      "We have a big great room area, blah, blah, blah, then two bedrooms and a bath upstairs, two bedrooms and a bath downstairs, and then a big den downstairs.\n",
      "So I have for instance, one of the rooms is my office but it's all full of stuff.\n",
      "But it's getting organized.\n",
      "I have now boxes with these are all stuff that's listed on eBay.\n",
      "This is all stuff that I'm going to list once I get to it.\n",
      "This is all stuff that needs to go.\n",
      "The other thing is with the pandemic, now all of our festivals for the summer are canceled.\n",
      "I usually do several flea markets and that kind of thing.\n",
      "But again, I haul all this stuff here, maybe I sell 10% or a quarter of it, it makes me feel really good because I'm like, I got rid of all that stuff and I made a few dollars.\n",
      "I haul the rest back and I'm like, this is so much work and it's just crazy.\n",
      "But it's like I don't have a choice though.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Which living areas would you say are cluttered?\n",
      "How cluttered are they?\n",
      "Can you walk through them?\n",
      "Or is it kind of like you only have a narrow pathway to get into those rooms?\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "It's just basically like, well, the basement, which was just a nightmare, full to the rafters recently.\n",
      "But like I said, the last few months I've really been making a dent in it.\n",
      "So now it's kind of good because you can walk around.\n",
      "It's nice for my partner because he's had this workbench down there and he needs to go down there once in a while for stuff.\n",
      "Now it's a little bit better at least for him.\n",
      "So made some strides down there.\n",
      "I do have one whole room that could be a bedroom, which we don't need as a bedroom.\n",
      "But it's very full.\n",
      "Like I said, at least it's kind of starting to get organized full.\n",
      "I know what everything is.\n",
      "We have separate bedrooms because I snore really badly.\n",
      "So my room is not bad, my room's okay, it could be a little neater.\n",
      "But otherwise, no, everything else is okay.\n",
      "We have a nice guest room, he has his bedroom, the bathrooms are fine.\n",
      "The little den is fine, the living area's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's mostly-\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Honestly, if he wasn't here, it probably would be worse.\n",
      "He's very diligent about making sure I keep things that way and he keeps things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like mostly you just have the basement and then one room that are kind of cluttered.\n",
      "But everything else is pretty neat.\n",
      "Participant 013:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Right now, I'm getting rid of 120 DVDs that weren't even mine, but I'm getting rid...\n",
      "Some of them were mine.\n",
      "And I'm just giving those to the Goodwill.\n",
      "So, it's a lot of stuff just going out.\n",
      "And will it make me feel any better?\n",
      "Only when I have more space around me, yes.\n",
      "But then the tendency to fill that space comes right into... I want to do that right away.\n",
      "And I don't do it on purpose.\n",
      "I like to have everything around me that I can work with.\n",
      "So that's us clutter bees, that's one of the way we rationalize.\n",
      "We say, \"Okay, I like to have everything around me that I'm going to work with,\" and then there's a million things you want around you.\n",
      "So, that gives you clutter right there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, what do you think-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "I'm a shop type person.\n",
      "In other words, I like working with my hands.\n",
      "I do electronics, I do mechanics, and so it's like I bring my shop into the house when I can and work at my desk or something.\n",
      "And then that doesn't mean I bring everything back out to the shop that I have in the garage.\n",
      "So some of that stuff stays in the house, and then it takes me awhile to bring it back to the garage and...\n",
      "Oh yeah, that's clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What do you think-\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:55:19] clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Like I tell you earlier, there's a fine line between the collector and the hoarder.\n",
      "And you would have to ask the psychiatrist because I've met collectors that are just obsessed with what they collect.\n",
      "Now, I've collected a little bit of this and a little bit of that and a little bit of this and a little bit of that.\n",
      "So I'm not obsessed with it, but every now and then I say...\n",
      "Years ago, I started saying, \"Well, if I start collecting these baseball cards, I can retire early.\"\n",
      "And so I sold a few baseball cards, and sure enough, it became lots of money.\n",
      "So after I realized that by holding onto things for 20, 30 years, you can make a lot of money that way, I started doing more and more of that and it became... I won't say it became a hobby, but then I became a collector.\n",
      "Then at the same time, I'm also a clutter person, so everything clutters up.\n",
      "I don't just save one thing, but I save maybe 30 different things.\n",
      "So there's a problem there between the collector and the hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so what about your kitchen or bathroom are those completely accessible?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Bathroom, yes.\n",
      "And I've got it handicap accessible with the bars and the things for getting out of the tub.\n",
      "The bathroom counter is cluttered.\n",
      "The kitchen, the counter space has a lot of utensils on it, egg blender, a toaster, all kinds of kitchen gadgets because I love kitchen gadgets, so the counter space is really not usable.\n",

      "Okay.\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like, in an ideal world?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "In an ideal world I would like it to look like it did when I first moved in, before I started unpacking and adding and changing things, where I could easily walk around, easily choose a chair to sit in without having to move things, and be comfortable having people come in my house.\n",
      "I'm okay with having a room or two being a disaster, but using my living room as a sorting place was not a good idea because now my living room is a disaster.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "Okay.\n",

      "Okay.\n",

      "How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 17:\n",
      "If it has...\n",
      "It's two things.\n",
      "Purpose, that it's useful, and secondly any associations that I may have with it, as to a person, a time, an event.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",

      "Participant 17:\n",
      "Well, obviously left over food or rotten fruit, stuff like that.\n",
      "Typical trash.\n",
      "Something that has a memory of a time that I did not like, or that brings pain to me I would get rid of.\n",
      "Magazines that are over a couple of years old that I don't feel like pulling out pages from.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "012\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. As you know, this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question will be what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "What term?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Whatever.\n",
      "Doesn't matter.\n",
      "I don't have any particular term.\n",
      "Whatever you want to call it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so hoarding disorder is fine?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "That's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Then the first part of the interview consists of demographic questions.\n",
      "What was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Are you Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then what was your highest degree or level of school you've completed?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Four years of college, bachelors.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is your household income?\n",
      "It can be in a range.\n",
      "We have less than $10,000, $11,000 to $20,000.\n",
      "It can be in a range.\n",
      "It doesn't have to be exact.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Well, COVID-19 kind of messed all that up this year.\n",
      "My husband's furloughed still.\n",
      "What we thought we were going to be in our annual income ... I just retired.\n",
      "I retire tomorrow.\n",
      "Our annual income's dropped significantly this year.\n",
      "We have no clue what it's going to end up being.\n",
      "It's probably going to be less than $60,000 this year.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "This is a very difficult time for a lot of people, unfortunately.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Be thankful ...\n",
      "Hopefully, this is actually a job for you, you're getting paid for it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, no. It's not.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Aww.\n",
      "Oh, well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Then the last question is which geographic region best describes where you live in the US?\n",
      "I have northeast, Midwest, south or west.\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "Southeast.\n",
      "Florida.\n",
      "I guess that would be south.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "The next portion of the interview is more conversation style.\n",
      "It's separated into a few different topics.\n",
      "This first one is about behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "Can you please describe your clutter problems and how long they've been going on?\n",
      "Participant 012:\n",
      "I can't remember not ever having a problem.\n",
      "I mean, having problems with it.\n",
      "I always collected things right from when I was very young.\n",
      "I've always had lots of stuff around in my room.\n",
      "I had tons of different kinds of collections.\n",
      "Just because I enjoyed so many different things.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "All my life.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Do I start by room?\n",
      "Do I start by objects such as cotton tee shirts?\n",
      "Where do I start?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it goes back to that feeling of being overwhelmed and feeling trapped?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, and alone with the problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "It's a problem for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I don't know anyone else except my brother's wife who is the biggest slob I've ever encountered in my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I think she wouldn't notice, but anyone else I know would notice big time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "And that would make me very embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So it goes back to those feelings of shame and embarrassment?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And how do your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Like I said, I don't let anybody in my house anymore except my best friend.\n",
      "My brother lives halfway across the country and he can't afford to fly and that was the best way to visit, so I haven't seen him.\n",
      "Family don't come in.\n",
      "I have casual friends at church, and I would be seeing them if not for the pandemic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Not just going to my classes at church, but we did a lot of social justice, social action projects, and I like doing that and working with immigrant families, and all of that stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And have you ever had conflicts with people close to you or landlords about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "No, because I've owned this house for about 19 years, I think.\n",
      "It's my house and it's inside, mostly.\n",
      "I am getting embarrassed about my front yard, but it's not to a point that a neighbor would complain.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "Yes, that's why I finally decided that I needed to assign one of my three bedrooms to be the place that I would put things I'm considering getting rid of.\n",
      "That room is now completely filled.\n",
      "I can't even walk in the room anymore.\n",
      "There's clothes on a single bed, there are countless books, probably several hundred books in that room alone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "There's a large closet that's filled with clothes and the bottom is filled with shoes.\n",
      "I've given up on that room and I live in all the other rooms of the house.\n",
      "I'm sitting in my...\n",
      "Every room in the house except my bedroom and bathrooms have stacks of paper, even the living room.\n",
      "I'm on a three cushion couch, and two of the cushions have papers on that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 16:\n",
      "I look at my easy chair with ottoman.\n",
      "The ottoman is covered in papers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative)\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "Okay. I do have the tendency to clutter up the sink and I try to always try to keep the surfaces clean, but I'll put things down and then have to move them to another space.\n",
      "So I have problems in that area.\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "I move things from one place to another, and then they get more cluttered.\n",
      "So it bothers me.\n",
      "And then I forget, I can't find something.\n",
      "I'm looking for a bill and I put another paper on top of that bill and put another thing on top of that paper.\n",
      "And so I have to go four or five things deep to find the bill that I forgot to pay last month.\n",
      "That's now charging me double interest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "So it's no fun being a clutter b. I'll tell you.\n",
      "If I had my choice, I wouldn't have a thing on this table here in front of me, which is just full of stuff.\n",
      "But I'm so used to having all this clutter in front of me.\n",
      "It's probably going to stay with me till I die, but I try to get my friends and people to help me on this.\n",
      "But even the people who love you, they're not going to really clean off your table for you.\n",
      "You can give them gifts from your table and I'll give them this, give them that, take this.\n",
      "Oh, no, no, that's yours, no take it, go ahead.\n",
      "And they will take it.\n",
      "And that sort of pleases me, but the only person who's ever going to clean it all up is myself, I'm pretty convinced.\n",
      "Unless I hire someone full time, like a nurse type person who's going to actually put everything in boxes and get rid of them, which I may end up doing.\n",
      "So right now I have one person trying to sell a lot of stuff for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So how do your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Have you ever had conflicts with anybody?\n",
      "Participant 011:\n",
      "How do they feel?\n",
      "They won't tell me the truth, that's for sure.\n",
      "That's how I know how they feel.\n",
      "Like I told you earlier, they'll kind of laugh and chuckle and think it's cute and all this and that, but I can't really get anybody to pin it down like a mental illness, I would say.\n",
      "Nobody's approached me saying, \"Gee, you really have a problem [Len 00:12:58].\"\n",
      "Nobody's said that to me because other people have little problems too but they're not total clutter b's.\n",
      "Don't just keep piling things on top of one another and then leave it that way, which I'm doing, unfortunately.\n",
      "So it doesn't depress me to tell you that much, but it's cumbersome in my life.\n",
      "And I find it hard to find things, but there's a plus to all this, the plus is that my memory is in good shape because I'm forced to have a good memory to find things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So this last session is going to talk about their stress and if it's caused any tension.\n",
      "So does your behavior upset you at all?\n",
      "Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Sometimes and I think part of it is the timing of it.\n",
      "For instance, right now I pulled some stuff out of the basement, some painting stuff.\n",
      "And then instead of taking the time to put it back, I just put it on the work bench.\n",
      "And then there's some boxes down there that I was looking for a decoration or two, and I pulled them off of each other and left them on the floor because I was busy doing something else.\n",
      "Then it's frustrating to me because I go back down and I think, \"Oh, why didn't I put this away?\"\n",
      "And then sometimes the haphazard way of doing things like that ends up...\n",
      "You put a bigger box on a smaller one and then it tips over and you've got a mess or something's broken.\n",
      "So that stuff sometimes frustrates me.\n",
      "And it's like, \"If you'd only take the time to do it right.\"\n",
      "So that's something that I really should work on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think it's ever gotten in the way of something that you've really wanted, or is it just more of a day to day it can get annoying and frustrating.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I think more day to day.\n",
      "Although there's sometimes when I've put things someplace, especially when something's been in one particular place, maybe the wrong place for a long time and you move it and then you think, \"Oh man, where did I put it?\" And so then you're shifting through things to get to what you're looking for.\n",
      "And that's maddening instead of having a place to put it in the first place, then it frustrates me.\n",
      "But I think mostly it's just a day to day annoyance.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Has it impacted your work at all?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I'd say my living at home a little bit, but at my work work you're talking about, is that what you mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like have you ever had a problem with coworkers or has a boss ever been like, \"You need to organize your desk more.\"\n",
      "Or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "No, but my job is it's a...\n",
      "I'm a clerk at the library and just part time.\n",
      "So I go in do my job and whatever work is left, the next person takes over from there.\n",
      "So I really don't have a lot of carry over from day to day.\n",
      "And it's just like you go in, you do your job and you go home and that's that.\n",
      "So it doesn't seem like it's affected my work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And those people, would you say that they have clutter problems or hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "No. However, one of them had mentioned that he would like to buy something really expensive because he would just like to have it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you see parallels?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "So, for him it's the...\n",
      "So, the thing of having could be part of hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right, right.\n",
      "That makes total sense.\n",
      "So, even though these individuals in these antique collector groups are organized, and that makes it different than hoarding disorder, that impulse to just have something in order to have it, that's very much the same.\n",
      "So, you can see that there's similarities.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That could be like hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "So, it sounds like there's really a spectrum in your mind.\n",
      "It's not cut or dry.\n",
      "It's some people have a little bit of hoarding.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right, whereas my sister is everything cut or dry, black or white, one extreme or the other, but to me, when you go from one extreme to the other, it's different sides of the same coin.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes total sense.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "So, it's not as simple as just saying, \"I'm going to keep things,\" or, \"I'm going to throw them all out.\"\n",
      "You might keep some things.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You either have to have everything or you have nothing, but I think there has to be a balance.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "When you hear the term hoarding disorder, what do you think about?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, the impulse to have more stuff than you need.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever heard about hoarding anywhere, being talked about or being discussed?\n",
      "What do people tend to say about it, and what's your knowledge of it?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, now people have this idea that it's totally wrong because they've seen these hoarding shows where things are way too out of hand.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, people have this very extreme view?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, now people have...\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They have the view that it's too extreme.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think of it as something that...\n",
      "If you were to give somebody advice on how to deal with hoarding problems, what advice would you give them?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I guess I don't really advise people because that would...\n",
      "There's one person I know who was paying a lot for storage, several storage units that would just accumulate more and more things, so I didn't really know what to say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What do you think would help you deal with all of your stuff?\n",
      "I mean, is it a problem of space?\n",
      "Is it a problem of time?\n",
      "Do you think that you would benefit from somebody to help you organize, or do you think that you would benefit from seeing someone like a doctor who could help you to deal with the anxiety component?\n",
      "What do you think would help you?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I'm always needing to know where I can take some things.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, you've seemed to lost maybe a few important things and-\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I may have lost a few important papers, but I can always...\n",
      "When it's time for taxes and stuff like that, I'm able to do that.\n",
      "I'm able to find everything I need and I do run my own wedding officiant business and I always have my contracts and that kind of stuff in order.\n",
      "So, I keep things under control, but like I said, I have all these spaces that I'm not able to use anymore.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you said your behavior isn't too severe, do you think it's a problem though?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "It's feeling like a problem because I'm beginning to worry that, you know, I'm older and I'm having friends to pass away and I'm thinking, \"Oh my God, if my son had to deal with this, if something happened and he had to deal with this this would be awful for him.\"\n",
      "And like I said, I would not let my friends look at my closets or my basement or anything like that\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, have you ever sought professional help with this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I have not.\n",
      "Not with this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has this caused any conflicts with your family and friends?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No, because I hide it pretty well.\n",
      "My husband knows not to open the closet door, go in my closet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, your husband doesn't touch any of the storage spaces?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Well, he uses the tool room and he uses the laundry room so that's where I try to make sure that he can get access to when he needs to get access to them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has this ever really upset him?\n",
      "Have you guys got in arguments over this?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "He pretty much respects my privacy, so.\n",
      "And like I say, I keep the areas that we use together fairly clear.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, what would you like your home to look like then in an ideal world?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "I'd love for my desk to look clear.\n",
      "I would love to feel if I want something I know where it is, I can get to it easily.\n",
      "I would like to feel like I'm unburdened with some of the stuff I keep is probably things I'll never use again, if they don't fit me, you know clothing that doesn't fit, things like that, and I'd really like to feel more spacious.\n",
      "It's a feeling kind of like this stuff is making me feel crammed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you're kind of starting to feel claustrophobic so you want more clarity, more space, and more organization?\n",
      "Participant 009:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, how important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Are there objects that you spend a lot of time with?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Really not easy for me to talk about it.\n",
      "So, I appreciate having the opportunity.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay, I just have to ask you some demographic questions, and then we'll be good to go.\n",
      "So, what ...\n",
      "This is, I guess, a two part question.\n",
      "What is the sex you were assigned at birth, and what is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For both?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I guess so.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Race?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Hispanic, yes or no?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Sorry that I'm typing in your ear.\n",
      "Household income?\n",
      "You can just give me an estimate, a range, if you don't know exactly.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah, so 125,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what is your geographic region?\n",
      "Like northeast?\n",
      "South?\n",
      "West?\n",
      "Not in the U.S., which I don't think is true.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Southwest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Highest level of education?\n",
      "I know you said college undergrad.\n",
      "Any further?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I have a master's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is your master's in, if you don't mind me asking?\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Geophysics.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Interesting.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Not something you hear very often.\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "A little joke.\n",
      "What does a geophysicist do?\n",
      "Well, they kill the conversation at a cocktail party whenever they're asked what they do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "People are like, \"Oh, I don't know how to follow up with that.\"\n",
      "Participant 008:\n",
      "I have nothing else to say in response to that.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And so your children, I know we've briefly talked about this before, but you said that they don't really get upset about it at all, right?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "They'll say something like, \"Man, you've had that forever.\"\n",
      "Or something like that, \"Why don't you get rid of that?\" But I wouldn't say that they get upset or anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "They've never tried to be like, \"I'm going to like help you clean this out.\"\n",
      "Or anything like that.\n",
      "They just say, \"Oh, you've had it a long time.\"\n",
      "And then move on.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Only if I say something to them like, \"I need to get rid of some of this stuff.\"\n",
      "And then they'll say, \"Well, let me help you.\"\n",
      "They're very supportive, but I would say they're not critical of me they're just-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Want what's best for you.\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And so our last question is would you like to change and why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 015:\n",
      "I would say I would just so things are neater.\n",
      "And so I can find things easier.\n",
      "If I put stuff in the right place the first time, instead of placing it down then I would know exactly where to find it.\n",
      "And I probably should just let go of some things.\n",
      "For instance, jewelry, I've got some that's extremely old and I really never wear.\n",
      "Well, why don't I just say, \"Okay, I'm going to limit myself to 10 pairs of earrings and that's it.\"\n",
      "But instead I have plenty more that I don't really wear.\n",
      "So I would like to change just to ease up and make life simpler.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That kind of concludes our-\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think about the different things that you keep, what do you think makes them valuable?\n",
      "Why is your stuff important to you?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "It's things that I have needed at one time, and so there is the idea that I might need it again, and then there's things that I think I could give to somebody.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, if your sister was there and was saying, \"Why do you keep this?\n",
      "Why do you have all of this?\" you would say, \"Well, this has been useful to me, and it might be-\"\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, you would have to go through each item one at a time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you have a different reason for keeping each thing?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yes, but then when things are all piled in one container, all miscellaneous, if each item has a different reason for being there, but yet there's too much of it, then there's the impulse to avoid it...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Because you'd have to think about-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... just because of all the work involved.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, because for each item you'd have to decide if you should keep it or not.\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you're going through that process, if you were to pick a random item, and you were to go through that process with me of deciding whether or not for any given item you should keep it or you should not, what does that process look like for you?\n",
      "What are the decisions that you make?\n",
      "So, would it be something like, \"Is this useful to me?\n",
      "Is this valuable?\"\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Is it useful to me, useful to someone else, or...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Valuable in terms of money?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "There had been the idea of, well, it could be more valuable in the future than it is now, but I don't really see the physical items that way anymore so much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you save a lot of old things.\n",
      "Would you say that that's right?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That you particularly like to save older things?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "What is it about older things that you feel you should save?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Well, I guess the scarcity.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, something that's older, you might not be able to get it anymore?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about, for instance, the letters that you're digitizing?\n",
      "If you were to explain to somebody like your sister, who doesn't understand, what is their importance?\n",
      "Why do those need to be saved?\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "I guess she's not too bad about that, but then there was a lot of way too many physical photographs that my mom had kept in the '80s and '90s, so these more recent ones, those I would really rather digitize, so once I've done that, I'll get rid of them-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, those, because they're not as old-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "... and then I've been now in the process of figuring out what equipment to use and when I'm going to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you intend to maybe get-\n",
      "Participant 018:\n",
      "So, there's that.\n",
      "023\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no problem at all.\n",
      "No, you're totally fine.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Okay, so that concludes the listing portion.\n",
      "Now we're going to kind of move into the more discussion-based questions.\n",
      "So the first question is, can you please describe your difficulties with clutter and how long this has been going on?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Oh, geez.\n",
      "I can remember from being a very young child, being four, five years old, I liked to get things.\n",
      "I liked to buy things that I always saved them and I needed to organize them.\n",
      "I had big [drawers 00:14:55] under my bed and I would spend hours like organizing them, trying to keep them neat because I save so much and trying to keep my room neat because I like organization.\n",
      "Even then, I had trouble getting rid of things.\n",
      "I wasn't the kind of kid who wanted to get something new and then throw away the old stuff.\n",
      "I wanted to have them for everything.\n",
      "So it was a matter of really trying to keep things organized.\n",
      "So I was very young.\n",
      "I mean, I was definitely four or five years old when I was already having the need to try to keep things organized.\n",
      "And then just, it continued.\n",
      "And now as an adult, it's much more with papers.\n",
      "I'm always falling behind.\n",
      "I can't keep up with things because I'm sort of compulsive in making sure I take care of everything thoroughly.\n",
      "If it's mail, I want to read it thoroughly.\n",
      "And then I have trouble keeping up with the demands of life because I can't process things fast enough.\n",
      "And instead of just getting rid of them, I have a tendency to collect them, wanting to get through them thoroughly enough once.\n",
      "I can, I do recycle them but I have problems with that.\n",
      "So it's really been very consistent throughout my life starting from, I would say the age of four or five.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you said this has been going on since about age four or five, and it really stems from your difficulties of being able to get rid of things.\n",
      "You find organization aesthetic, but getting to that place is difficult.\n",
      "Would you agree?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "And I am somewhat work organized.\n",
      "I mean, I think that helps prevent the problems from being worse than it is, but yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how severe would you say that your behavior is now?\n",
      "I know you said it's kind of been consistent, but how severe do you think it is?\n",
      "And do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Let me go back to the last question again also.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "The clothes, I prefer to sell them on Craigslist.\n",
      "I put... I had 20 pairs of jeans.\n",
      "I put 20 pairs of jeans for $10 on Craigslist and nobody bought them.\n",
      "I put them on for $5 and nobody bought them.\n",
      "I prefer to sell clothes or anything on Craigslist because I make all these friends that come to the house that want the stuff.\n",
      "Sometimes they'll come to buy clothes and I just give it to them, but then again, that goes back to I like to see that somebody else is going to enjoy what I have enjoyed.\n",
      "Now, this question...\n",
      "What was this question?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered \"normal\" saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "The differences?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, the differences between what most people would consider normal saving behavior like collecting and then hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I would say that people who collect usually are limited to a certain item or a certain category.\n",
      "I have a lot of categories that I'm interested in collecting.\n",
      "I have a friend that actually he a hoarder collector, and he started a business called Hank's Memorabilia because he collected the same things that I do, Mikey Mouse and all that kind of stuff, toys.\n",
      "He loves toys.\n",
      "He became a millionaire with this business because he started selling his collections.\n",
      "He still has a couple of things.\n",
      "He just sold his business, but he still has a couple of things.\n",
      "He had a warehouse.\n",
      "He had a few things around his house, but there again, it was his wife that limited.\n",
      "If it was just him, it would have been different.\n",
      "He had a few things around his house and then his collections were in this warehouse.\n",
      "My kids have suggested...\n",
      "They have said, \"Mom, why don't you just put them in the plastic bins?\n",
      "[inaudible 00:58:42] I told you that.\"\n",
      "\"Well, if they're in plastic bins, no, that doesn't give me pleasure to go around and see them and look at them.\n",
      "The difference between a hoarder is I think that a hoarder keeps everything and a collector is limited to certain types of things or certain items.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thinking about hoarding disorder, how is that either the same or different from your collecting?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "From my collecting?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It similarities or differences between how you collect versus someone or what you describe as hoarding versus someone that might have hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "There was a whole floor of my house I could not use because of hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You made great progress now, but before that, have you ever sought to change the behavior?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh, I always thought about it, but would never follow through.\n",
      "I was just too worried about those reasons, why I bought this and I didn't finish it so I needed to keep it to finish it, or maybe someone else would need this, that type of stuff.\n",
      "But up until, like I said, two months ago when we became quarantined and I couldn't go anywhere, so I just stayed home and went through everything that I owned.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever thought to go to professional help for the behavior?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No, mm-mm (negative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Could you explain why not?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Well, I lived overseas until about 10 years ago.\n",
      "It would be a different language and that kind of stuff.\n",
      "Then when I came here, I just never really had the time to do it because I was working and doing stuff, avoidance.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Have you ever had conflicts with them?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Well, it always would hurt my feelings when they would say, \"Well, why do you have all this stuff?\" Yeah, it would make me feel bad.\n",
      "I have four sisters.\n",
      "I come from a real large family.\n",
      "I wouldn't want people to come into my house because there's all this stuff everywhere all the time.\n",
      "It really made me fearful because I didn't want anyone to see how I lived.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Have you ever had any landlords that maybe had problems with your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No, not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No?\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "The next section is going to be having you talk about your space and living area.\n",
      "Can you please describe the area you live in now?\n",
      "Do you live alone?\n",
      "What does this space look like?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Describe the space I live in now since I cleaned it out last month?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I live in a condominium?\n",
      "It's two bedrooms.\n",
      "Things are put away now.\n",
      "Before, things were never put away.\n",
      "I went through and sorted everything and gave stuff away or threw it away that was worthless and gave stuff to charity that I didn't need anymore.\n",
      "Now, you can walk through every room.\n",
      "There are no problems with anything, but it took two months to do that working almost every day, probably six days a week.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Would you say before that you had stuff covering your counters and boxes and stuff?\n",
      "How did it look?\n",
      "027\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All righty.\n",
      "I was wondering if you could start.\n",
      "We're going to do these things that are called free listing prompts, but before we get started with that, I just wanted to ask what term you would prefer when you're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Would you say that again please?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Do you have a specific term you would prefer when we talk about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "No, I don't have any problem with it.\n",
      "However you want to call it.\n",
      "I think that I have both, but it's not a problem for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, do you like the term hoarding or do you prefer a different one?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "No, hoarding is fine.\n",
      "I tell people I'm a hoarder.\n",
      "Actually, I am a collector.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A collector.\n",
      "Would you prefer me to use the term collecting?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I really don't care.\n",
      "You can use whatever you want.\n",
      "It does not bother me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that's good to know.\n",
      "I know some people do have preferences, so we want to be cognizant.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "No, I'm proud of both.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "I think I have a good picture.\n",
      "Thank you for that.\n",
      "Now, we're going to go through some more standard questions.\n",
      "You've described a few different things that you collect.\n",
      "How long has this been going on for you?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I would say that I hoarded when I was a child.\n",
      "I came from a family with my dad was extremely abusive, physically, emotionally and sexually.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I'm sorry, what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I just said I'm sorry to hear that.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah, that was not good.\n",
      "I think that I recall hoarding my Halloween candy or anything that I got.\n",
      "I felt like it was not safe if it was out in the open, so I would hide it.\n",
      "To this day, there are silver dollars from the 1800s that my grandfather that gave me that are buried under a tree in my backyard in New Jersey.\n",
      "I don't know where they are, but anyway...\n",
      "I remember burying them.\n",
      "I hid my grandmother's wedding ring.\n",
      "When she died, that's what they gave me.\n",
      "I was probably around 10, and I hid that in a board in the house.\n",
      "I never recovered that.\n",
      "I think I've been doing this my whole life.\n",
      "It's just that at this point, I have a very large house, and we're putting another addition on it.\n",
      "I have a second house, so I have room for these things.\n",
      "I also have a barn.\n",
      "I have a four-car garage, so I have a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so lots of spaces.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I have lots of space, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Based off what you said earlier, it sounds like you don't believe that this is a problem because these are things that you give to others or that you eventually need.\n",
      "Is that correct?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah, that and also some of the things are very emotionally important to me because they are games that I played with my children.\n",
      "I do sell some things on Craigslist.\n",
      "I've made about $500 in the past month on selling things, but I like to do it that way because I meet the people.\n",
      "They want the item because it's important to them or they can use it.\n",
      "I just sold the Apple II computer, the second computer ever built.\n",
      "It belonged to my son in law and then it belonged to my son, but I really didn't have an attachment to it.\n",
      "I was saving it because it was cool, and I liked looking at it, but it really didn't mean anything to me.\n",
      "It takes a lot for me to sell something, but if I don't think I'm going to need it in the future, I don't have somebody to give it to, and it has no meaning for me, then I can get rid of it, but I want to get rid of to somebody who is not going to put it at the end of their driveway for the trash people to come and crush.\n",
      "That kills me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so making sure that it goes somewhere where it's going to be of use.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like this Fisher-Price tool...\n",
      "It's a whole big thing.\n",
      "Why would somebody put that out for the trash?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",

      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "So you've never gone to any professional for help for this behavior or anything?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "No, no. I also hoard... I really like to collect sayings, inspirational stories, inspirational pictures.\n",
      "I just bought three more filing cabinets.\n",
      "I already have one, two, three, four, five... I already have six filing cabinets, and I just bought three more.\n",
      "I'm trying to file this stuff, but the thing is that I really like looking up and reading an inspirational saying on the...\n",
      "I'm sitting here at my desk and in front of me is a thank you note.\n",
      "I was a nanny, and my nanny little boy wrote to me when he was about 10.\n",
      "He's now about 23.\n",
      "I look at it and I think of him, and that gives me pleasure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's nice.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do your family and friends feel about your behavior or feel about hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... this in your home where you spend time, so the computer room and the kitchen, as being especially cluttered places.\n",
      "And I wanted to talk you through the kinds of items you keep and how you make decisions about when you're going to keep something versus when you're going to get rid of it.\n",
      "So if you were to just kind of look around your home wherever you are right now, and think about your stuff, how do you decide when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, [inaudible 00:00:33].\n",
      "I'm in the kitchen now, so if I was deciding to give away something to get rid of something here, it would be that it's taking up too much space in, let's say a cabinet or a drawer.\n",
      "The drawer has got too much in it or the cabinet too much in it, like cooking pots and pans and forks and knives and those kinds of things.\n",
      "That's how I would decide here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So let's think about, for example, your computer room, let's say you needed some more space in there.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, my computer room, it is really a cluttered room.\n",
      "Well, I have three places that are unnecessarily uttered, that's one of them.\n",
      "That ends up having many different things and items other than what pertains to what I'm doing with a computer.\n",
      "Because for 15 years, I did grief counseling for pet loss.\n",
      "So I accumulated a lot of books on grief and dogs and people and et cetera.\n",
      "And there wasn't room in the third room where I keep books.\n",
      "So I put more books, I bought bookshelves and put more into the computer room.\n",
      "How do I decide?\n",
      "Well, I decided when I decided to retire from doing the grief counseling, I did get rid of some of the books.\n",
      "I thought I don't need all these books anymore.\n",
      "So, that was easy to do.\n",
      "Because it really wasn't emotional things there.\n",
      "Except some of the dog books were, because they were things I had before.\n",
      "It's a corner desk or I have the computer in the middle and there's shelves on either sides of it.\n",
      "And I have two file drawers there, and every time I go in to file something like a medical paper or something, it's getting so stuffed.\n",
      "So, every time I open it, I think, \"I've got to clean this out.\"\n",
      "But I never get around to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So if you were to go back to that process of getting rid of those books, for example.\n",
      "When you were going through your books, how did you decide which ones you were going to keep and which ones you were going to get rid of?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well, with my husband, I mean we've just been married for five years.\n",
      "Yeah, he would prefer that we not have so much disorganization because he likes things to be orderly, but there's just some spaces that I just had to tell him, \"You just have to leave it,\" you know we have to compromise on it.\n",
      "Yeah, I mean it has created some difficult times for us.\n",
      "It would be good if we could have that bedroom either turn it into a closet or use it for a guest bedroom, you know.\n",
      "When people come, I mean I have other guest bedrooms in the house so it's not really an issue because we have two other bedrooms we can use for guests.\n",
      "It would be nice to be able to have some organization in that room so that I don't have to keep the door closed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel that the saving and acquiring new items and having an accumulation of items is a problem for you?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah I like to spend money and I like, like I say, I said before, I like to have a variety of choices when it comes to my personal body, like dressing and accessories and things like that.\n",
      "Yeah I have a tendency to accumulate more than I need.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "In the past have you ever tried to diminish the spending on items, or the accumulation of new items?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Oh yeah, yeah that's a constant battle.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has anything helped with it?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Has anything helped?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well yeah.\n",
      "I mean I started having foot problems a little over a year ago, and I got to where I couldn't wear a lot of my shoes.\n",
      "I had a lot of shoes.\n",
      "I've gotten rid of a ton of shoes, and I've also stopped buying shoes for the most part.\n",
      "I have bought a few pair that are better for my feet, but having foot problems kind of created the need to stop spending money on shoes, and it also has forced me to get rid of a bunch of shoes that are no longer comfortable, or good for my feet.\n",
      "Then weight gain is always an issue, and so I've outgrown some clothes that this is a problem.\n",
      "I've outgrown some of my clothes but I refuse to get rid of them because I think, \"Oh I'm going to lose some weight and I'm going to get back in them.\"\n",
      "The reality is that's probably not the case.\n",
      "There are some things that I probably should just go ahead and dispose of.\n",
      "If I do lose weight I'll just buy new clothes probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you decide when you should be getting rid of an item?\n",
      "Will that be something that you wear or any other kind of item, maybe not clothing or jewelry?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "How do I decide when to get rid of it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, well even if they're not post hoc, even if they're real justifications, they still see them as justifications.\n",
      "So, what they are saying is, \"There are good reasons for saving objects in our society and I am saving objects in a way that is acceptable,\" and so I guess what I'm wondering, to frame this as a question is, from the US to Australia, do you see any differences in the way that people would justify this?\n",
      "Like this scrupulosity that [NAME 1:08:08] talks about, environmental ways or, you know, there's really a spectrum, and so I'm wondering, is what people are saying when they give these justifications some kind of litany of reasons that we as a society have said, \"It's okay to save a lot of things.\"\n",
      "So like, sentimental reasons, or environmental reasons, or usefulness.\n",
      "Are these like some kind of way that we as a society justify saving in general and hoarders are just using them?\n",
      "And if so, is that different in Australia?\n",
      "Interviewee: Absolutely, and what the person thinks is more of a justification.\n",
      "So, wherever I go on TV or radio and talk about clutter and hoarding, I notice people get really hopped up, particularly about the idea of discarding books.\n",
      "I think that speaks to your point a little bit, that people see--everyone agrees that books are great, right, and knowledge and literature, and books are this cornerstone of our civilization, and how could you ask me to throw our book?\n",
      "So, they might save a whole bunch of other stuff, but they hang on to that as something that seems morally defensible.\n",
      "\"You're asking me to throw out my books, that seems like it would make me an evil person,\" and I also love books so, I get what they're talking about.\n",
      "But I would say maybe what's also interesting about your point is not just cultural differences, and I'm not sure there's sufficient differences in the culture of Australia and the U.S., I mean there are some differences in that domain, but also differences in time.\n",
      "I think since I grew up in the 80s, there's been a lot more awareness of environmental impact and landfall and plastic.\n",
      "I mean, where I live has a particular emphasis on plastic in the oceans because I live near the water, but in general that awareness, I would like to see whether or not that has heightened over time.\n",
      "I think, and I would have some weird memory bias here, but when I was treating hoarding patients as a student, like in the early 2000s, there was less talk of, \"Landfill, it's going to landfill\" and now that that's become heightened in everyone's mind, there is a lot more talk in our hoarding groups of \"I just can't bear this is going to go and sit in landfill.\"\n",
      "So, I wonder in a way sometimes I think about how the intersection between public policy regarding we need people to recycle, we need people to reuse, we need people not to just throw things away mindlessly, has interacted with hoarding clients.\n",
      "Their environmental scrupulosity, like I guess I wonder whether Randy's measure is going to go up and up and up in time, and whether in some ways it's a good thing.\n",
      "Like as a population we need to become more environmentally scrupulous, but the hoarding clients it's problematic because it means that sometimes they can't see that, yes this is going to landfill and there really is no other option.\n",
      "What I always talk about with clients is like, if you find something that's actually not recyclable in your home, and it can't be recycled and it can't be reused, then no one wants it, like--I don't know of a good example, like a broken piece of a plastic toy--you can say you can't throw it away because you really don't want it to go to landfill, but then what happens is the landfill becomes your house.\n",
      "Your house is the landfill, and eventually when you die that landfill will get moved to the real landfill, but you're not doing any favors to the landfill by keeping the landfill in your house.\n",
      "Um, anyways, sorry that was a long rant but my point is I do think that cultural, socially sanctioned reasons is a really amazing, great point as well but I've seen more changes with time than across the U.S. vs Australia.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh yeah, oh yeah.\n",
      "Definitely, definitely.\n",
      "For instance, I'm an all around the year shopper for Christmas and stuff because, as I explained, we lived overseas so our shopping was always limited as to what you could buy and stuff.\n",
      "We'd come to America and buy stuff for Halloween and Christmas in June every year.\n",
      "I shop a lot and I would buy these things and I'll put them away and then I can't find them when it's time for Christmas to give to people\n",
      "I get really upset because where could it possibly be?\n",
      "I found everything I think I was looking for recently, when I was doing my little purge down there the last couple of months, but it was really upsetting at the time that, \"Well now, I'm going to have to go out and buy more, even I've already bought all of this ahead of time and I have it wrapped and it's all ready to go, but where'd I put it?\n",
      "I have no idea.\"\n",
      "It was upsetting, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you lived abroad, do you think you valued stuff differently because you weren't able to get it necessarily?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Well kind of, yeah, because we're Americans and we lived in Asia for years and years, probably 15 years, and we lived in Europe for about 10 years.\n",
      "We valued stuff that we could get that was American, especially in Asia, because you're automatically a foreigner there.\n",
      "You don't look like anybody else, so you always stand out, you're always different.\n",
      "To buy the stuff that I needed to have for my children to have this American style life overseas, I really valued it a lot.\n",
      "Now I look back and I go, \"Why didn't I buy some really good stuff in Europe?\" It's those things I didn't buy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's really interesting.\n",
      "How did it impact your relationships?\n",
      "You mentioned briefly that it upset your sisters, but did it affect your marriage at all?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No, no, because my husband's kind of the same way I am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "You just kind of fed off of each other?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah, uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We're buyers and always have been, but he's not the bargain shopper like I am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, Was it difficult at all to get him to help you clean out?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Well, he took a long time and that's why the quarantine time, it was the first time.\n",
      "We both are retired.\n",
      "We don't work and we both are healthy and we can't go anywhere, so this is the time we're going to do it.\n",
      "I never wanted to do it by myself because I never thought I would be able to accomplish it because it was so overwhelming.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you guys get anyone to help you or anything?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No, no. We just did it ourselves, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I think there was a time when my partner wanted to host somebody and it was just...\n",
      "We both recognize we couldn't...\n",
      "Let's say, it would have to be that weekend and it was a Wednesday and we wouldn't have time with working to clean up the house.\n",
      "So there was tension over it.\n",
      "We would want to be able to host but we couldn't see a way to do it and feel comfortable because we're not comfortable just saying like, \"Yeah, sorry our house is a mess.\n",
      "Hey, come on over.\"\n",
      "So we didn't go ahead and do it and so it caused conflict and it caused personal distress for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I totally see why.\n",
      "So I think that really covers everything for the free response section.\n",
      "So I'm just going to go ahead and ask you a couple of demographic questions.\n",
      "If you're uncomfortable answering any of them, no problem at all.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then after I stopped the recording, I'm going to ask for some payment information for the gift card.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sex assigned at birth?\n",

      "Female.\n",

      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic or Latina?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Average household income?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Probably somewhere around $80 to $100,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And your geographic region like Northeast, Southwest, and West?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I think it's technically...\n",
      "It's the Northeast, but it's Mid-Atlantic because I'm in Eastern Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, Great.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: That seems to be something that's a little bit different than with object hoarding is, while there's these DSM-V criteria that are applied that are applied to individuals to see if they are individuals with hoarding disorder, but it seems that process of diagnosis happens quite infrequently with animal hoarding, it tends to be a situation where there either is or is not legal intervention necessary and that's as far as it goes.\n",
      "Interviewee: Did I send you, or I can send you if you don't have it the article that [NAME 37:47] and I wrote on case outcomes in--\n",
      "Interviewer: No you didn't but I would love it, yeah\n",
      "Interviewee: Do you have it?\n",
      "Interviewer: No, I can look it up though but I would love it if you could send it to me, I spoke to [NAME 37:57].\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah I definitely will send it to you, it's now probably we really should revisit that because obviously we're much farther down the road, I should talk to [NAME 38:07] about re-doing it, it was a little difficult to put together obviously as a follow up.\n",
      "We followed more than 50 cases and obviously there's much more psychological--that was even before the recognition of hoarding disorder, so it's time to do a follow-up.\n",
      "But that will at least give you the early stages of recognition of the problem, what the different case outcomes were.\n",
      "A major shift I've seen probably in the last five years and particularly since the inclusion of hoarding disorder is much less advocacy for jail time and we've all obviously pushed for that and that's part of the general trend, again what we're talking with the prosecutors today about is basically a trend away from incarceration in general or as someone, one of our California DAs said, \"nobody in California goes to jail anymore\" [laughs].\n",
      "And of courts all the courts are pushing for well can't we have intervention treatment or whatever, unfortunately we don't have the magic treatment and as you well know, even in object hoarding cases the recidivism rate is still quite high and in animal hoarding seems to be even higher.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah. The first step is to go, \"Well, look at this dress.\n",
      "This is so pretty and you bought this and it cost $150,\" and you were going to wear it to this party, but the party didn't happen or maybe you did wear it to the party, but you've never worn it again.\n",
      "What you have to realize is that, \"No, you're never going to wear that again.\n",
      "You need to just give it to someone else who can use it.\"\n",
      "That's a hard step to take, I think, that first step.\n",
      "I've been going through my closet right now and I have two pairs of shoes in there that I bought before my son was born, and my son is 36.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "They're really nice shoes.\n",
      "I've never worn them.\n",
      "I put them in this pile to give to the charity.\n",
      "I think about how many times have I cleaned out my closet and I never would take those shoes out because I paid a lot of money for them and they're really pretty.\n",
      "It's not like they're out of style.\n",
      "They're just kind of plain shoes.\n",
      "When you're old like me them anywhere, it doesn't matter.\n",
      "That was a real big step for me to be able to do that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No, that is a huge step in learning to clean.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "You have to do this thing where you have to cut your losses.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No, it's not going to happen.\n",
      "A promise is not going to be kept that you're going to finish the hand embroidered seat covers for all your dining chairs.\n",
      "You're not going to get it done, so you might was well just let them go.\n",
      "Let that go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did your behavior upset you a lot?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "When I kept accumulating?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh yeah, oh yeah.\n",
      "All the time, all the time, because I couldn't find stuff.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I'm sure you've heard that from other people, but like, \"Oh, I need this scarf to wear with this outfit but I can't find that scarf because there are 100 scarves here, so I'll just have to buy another one,\" that kind of stuff.\n",
      "It was really upsetting because you know you have something but you can't find it.\n",
      "This happened to me a lot in my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Did you think it ever got in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Interviewer: So kind of-- if they’re acquiring more from the Home Shopping Network, that would be a different diagnosis?\n",
      "That would be, maybe addictive acquiring as opposed to hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well we would have to rule out compulsive shopping, not that that’s necessarily a DSM.\n",
      "But our approach would still be hoarding, in that most people would think it’s pretty excessive- you don’t need 10 boxes of sauce pans.\n",
      "But the way we would treat it would be a little different.\n",
      "But it still might be hoarding-\n",
      "[cross talk]\n",
      "Interviewer: But do you find that its-\n",
      "Interviewee: Sorry go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer: No, no, no. Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewee: No that’s okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: I was just wondering if you find that home size is an issue when making determinations when people have really large houses with a lot of storage areas and storage units versus if they live in very small spaces and that might perhaps clutter more easily?\n",
      "Or if you don’t really feel like that’s an issue?\n",
      "Interviewee: Only a small- to a very small degree, because most people learn to live within their space.\n",
      "So, people who don’t have hoarding, if they’re in a very small space, usually learn how to live within that space.\n",
      "Uhm so, but to some degree it might be an issue to factor in, but I don’t think a huge degree.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like the criteria that’s of- it substantially compromises the intended use.\n",
      "Is there an extent in which you take into account what the patient might intend for the space?\n",
      "So, for example, if the patient doesn’t cook they might not want to use their kitchen in quite the same way as somebody who is a cook, they might store things in it.\n",
      "Or is that also not something that really comes up?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm it doesn’t actually come up that much.\n",
      "Because-- that’s a good question in a way, because most of the hoarders that I know actually do not cook, but they’ve never said, “I don’t use my kitchen, therefore I use it for something else.”\n",
      "Uhm, so most of them, actually even though they might not cook, they want a functional kitchen, even to put their take-out food or their ready-meals or that kind of thing.\n",
      "I think 99% of them, they will tell you they have every intention of cooking.\n",
      "Again, that would be another project they would want to do down the line, but they’ve never gotten to.\n",
      "So I’ve never had a hoarder say “I don’t need an office, because I don’t do office work, so I use this room for something else.”\n",
      "I’ve not had that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhm, so they seem to want to use it for whatever its intended purpose is, but they are not able to.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "And since I live in earthquake country, that could come up too.\n",
      "I know in the past, and I would say the distant past, I've thought about that.\n",
      "What would happen if a fire start in my house, what would I grab to take?\n",
      "Well, of course the dogs I would grab to take first.\n",
      "But as far as inanimate objects, I would probably take some jewelry that was my mother's, because it's very valuable.\n",
      "That's probably one thing I'd grab and that's small.\n",
      "What else would I grab?\n",
      "That's hard to think about.\n",

      "It's hard to pick which things would you would take?\n",

      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's hard because there's so much that you'd like to take or it's hard because-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "No, it's just because I have to think about so many things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Maybe another way of thinking about it is what do you think you'd miss the most, if you didn't have it all?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "That's hard to think about too, because everything except me and my dogs and some antiques I could live without, or I could replace.\n",
      "Now I have to think through what's in each room.\n",
      "Some valuable jewelry would be definitely the first thing I would try to get to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's because it's monetarily valuable and you could sell it?\n",
      "Or is it because it's sentimentally valuable?\n",
      "Because it was your mother's.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Say that again [inaudible 00:08:42].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "Is it because it's valuable in terms of money and you could sell it?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I would say it's valuable in money and it's also valuable in memories.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's got both of those kinds of value?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "And I might even grab ... no I wouldn't grab.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's a hard question.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "That's a very good question.\n",
      "Well, it would depend on where I was in the house at the moment that I had to get out.\n",
      "If I was in the bedroom, it would definitely be the jewelry.\n",
      "I don't know that I'd run to any other room.\n",
      "I can buy a new computer.\n",
      "I might grab, because it's easy to grab and unplug the things that I use as a backup to back up everything in my computer.\n",
      "Not the computer, but the backup little box.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you'd want the information rom the computer?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "That's close, I can run from bedroom into that very easily and grab that very easily.\n",
      "And that has finances and all kinds of things on it.\n",
      "So yes, probably grab that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Let's think about the opposite of this.\n",
      "So if you think about all the very cluttered spaces in your house, so your computer room, the back bedroom and the garage, do you feel like there's stuff in there that's trash?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Okay. Go ahead.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, that's okay.\n",
      "How old are you?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I'll be 74 in two weeks.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so very close.\n",
      "Happy early birthday.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "We're celebrating it at the North Pole.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "At the North Pole?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah, we leave Tuesday.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is very exciting.\n",
      "I hope you enjoy your trip.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Yeah, we went to Antarctica and now we're going to to the Arctic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Pole to pole, wow.\n",
      "That's impressive.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Pole to pole and around the world, that's the goal.\n",
      "The only thing left we have to do is staying in Africa, which we're doing on a clipper ship in April.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, very cool.\n",
      "That's very exciting.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is your highest level of education that you've achieved?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I have two degrees.\n",
      "I have a teaching degree, bachelor's, and a nursing degree, bachelor's.\n",
      "I call that bachelor's plus two because I already had the first two years of undergrad, so I just needed to do the nursing courses.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "And is that the gender you identify with as well?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then what race do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Caucasian, white.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Non Hispanic?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You already knew the next question I was going to ask you.\n",
      "I think it's fairly standard.\n",
      "Then just as a range, just a general number, about what is your household income?\n",
      "I can give you some ranges if that helps?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Household income because I have Jerry living with me, do you want his too or just mine?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you consider it as a combined income, then you can combine both?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I'll ask him.\n",
      "[inaudible 01:14:24].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "He said, yes, I can consider the two.\n",
      "170,000.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All righty.\n",
      "I just have a few more questions to make sure I get your...\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "We're spending on traveling and hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "There's a lot of bedrooms that are used for my hoarding stuff, but they are also not used because I don't have anybody sleeping here.\n",
      "All of the bathrooms are clear and we use them all.\n",
      "Actually, we might be putting another bathroom on as well.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, added with the sunroom?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "My significant other has Parkinson's with a little dementia, and I have the gene for Alzheimer's, so our intent is to make this into our nursing home and to bring in a caregiver if we need to.\n",
      "I'm just trying to make things handicap accessible for a wheelchair for when that point comes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Other than making your home more handicap accessible and more of this nursing home esque place, is there anything that is different about how your home is now and what you would like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I do a lot for the Coast Guard, and like I said, I have a lot of paperwork and I save a lot of things like Alzheimer's research, all of the stuff that I get from you guys that are the consent forms and all that kind of stuff.\n",
      "What I would like...\n",
      "The reason I purchased these three other filing cabinets, which by the way were at the yard sale for $10 each... I have a lot of papers that are in bins like the consent forms and Coast Guard stuff.\n",
      "I would like to put them into the filing cabinets, but we have a very active life.\n",
      "We're always doing a lot of things that are very interesting and making memories, and we have a nine-month-old puppy, so I find that I really don't have the time to concentrate on organizing the paperwork and putting it where it should be.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "That I would like to change.\n",
      "I would like to get the piles of stuff off the floors and out of laundry baskets and into these filing cabinets.\n",
      "That is an intent that I have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that makes sense, putting things into filing cabinets and getting them off of the floor.\n",
      "Kind of switching gears and thinking about the possessions themselves... I know we talked about some things are valuable because of the memories that they have.\n",
      "How do you determine...\n",
      "If there's any criteria other than that or things that people might use in the future, how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "The memory I think is the most important thing.\n",
      "Another thing is whether it is pleasing to me to look at it.\n",
      "For instance, I really like the little Fisher-Price toys and things, and they do have a memory, but I also think it's pretty cool.\n",
      "I like Minions.\n",
      "My kids didn't have Minions growing up.\n",
      "They really don't have any memory associated with them, but I just think that they're cute.\n",
      "I like things that are cute and colorful.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, that’s great.\n",
      "Are there any other differences that you’ve noted?\n",
      "You know, racially, in terms of SES, rural versus urban?\n",
      "Interviewee: Economically, I would say lower economic class.\n",
      "But that-- yes, for sure.\n",
      "These are people who are struggling financially, mostly.\n",
      "Ethnicity, mostly white, but that can be because we’re a hospital that only takes insurance and things like that- that might not represent the general population at all.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. And can you think of a specific case or maybe a couple cases that were challenging to diagnose, either clinically or in research, because the individuals were on the border between pathological and nonpathological behavior, maybe subclinical?\n",
      "And how you went about making that distinction?\n",
      "Interviewee: Huh… I can’t think of many cases where it was difficult to diagnose because of- there was subclinical.\n",
      "Usually it’s more difficult to diagnose because the person with hoarding is very much trying to keep it a secret or very much minimize the problem, but we would use the very typical standard kind of clinical definition of hoarding; if they have so much stuff that they cant use areas of their home for their intended function or they are tending to accumulate stuff that the rest of us might think of as junk or excessive, we do put a little bit more emphasis I think-- at UNIVERSITY [00:22:34] we put a bit more emphasis on executive functioning deficits too- that that’s a huge part of hoarding disorder that isn’t necessarily in the clinical criteria.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: How did that manifest in the patients that you’ll see with deficits?\n",
      "Interviewee: Very disorganized, unable to make decisions, unable to prioritize, difficulty initiating a task, difficulty completing tasks-- Even the most mundane, banal, simple tasks, they typically struggle with.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Do you feel like it’s sometimes difficult to make a clinical diagnosis of hoarding disorder in terms of other, either concomitant mental health problems that the person might have or because they might look similar to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and other mental health disorders?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I mean, I’m kind of used to doing pretty thorough and pretty extensive evaluations.\n",
      "So, we would do a thorough evaluation for OCD and we’d do a thorough evaluation for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "If we suspect hoarding disorder, we always ask for photographs of the home- they bring in photographs of their home; we usually go down and look at their car.\n",
      "No, I think we can usually-- I don’t think we’ve had much, kind of a quizzical diagnosis with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "But maybe we deal with a specific range of hoarding disorders, so we do deal with the kind of mild to moderate to moderate to severe range.\n",
      "We don’t really deal with extreme severe hoarding disorder, not the kind of stuff that you see on the shows all the time- sometimes but not very often.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Uhm so kind of to continue along these lines, we want to think through the DSM5 criteria with you; just in terms of seeing how its applied, seeing how the individual, kind of, criteria come into play in making a diagnosis.\n",
      "So, for the next portion of the interview, I’d like to just read you the criteria and then get your- kind of get your feedback on how you think about them and how you’ve used them.\n",
      "And you’ve used these criteria with the intent of diagnosing an individual with hoarding disorder, correct?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's cool.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "My son...\n",
      "That family have not been to my house in 13 years, even though they only live an hour and a half away.\n",
      "I'm invited to their house, but they don't come to my house.\n",
      "The other dynamic of that is their dad and I got divorced after 43 years of marriage.\n",
      "I have a live-in boyfriend, so I'm thinking that that is the reason because they came to my house before I had this boyfriend.\n",
      "I'm thinking that is the reason that it is, but I do know that my kids don't approve of this.\n",
      "However, I have told them and in my will, it says, \"They don't even need to come into the house if they don't want to.\"\n",
      "If they want to come into the house and go through each room and pick out what they want to keep, that's fine.\n",
      "If not, they call.\n",
      "It's an exclusive auction house that sells vintage things.\n",
      "They've sold things for me before.\n",
      "They call that number.\n",
      "He's been right through my house.\n",
      "He knows what I have.\n",
      "He comes through and takes what he wants and then they call another auctioneer that does estate sales and he comes in and he sells it either right from the property or takes it to his place and sell it.\n",
      "My kids don't have to do a thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Including selling the house.\n",
      "That auctioneer will sell the house as well.\n",
      "I feel like what I am doing, I am doing for myself.\n",
      "If I die, in a half a day, everything can be gone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like this is really something that your children and their spouses don't necessarily like, but it's something that you're doing for yourself and you've tried to make arrangements so that it's taken care of down the road.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Since we were talking about your house a little bit, I know you mentioned that you're getting an extension on that house and that you have quite a bit of space.\n",
      "Can you just describe where you live now and what the space is like?\n",
      "Interviewer: So another example that was a real example that was given was a person who had a patient who hoarded exclusively digital media, who never deleted any emails and downloaded thousands and thousands of digital books and had hard drives filled with books that they would never read, but felt that they might someday; but, also didn't clutter their space because all of it was electronic media.\n",
      "So like, thousands of movies, thousands of digital content essentially.\n",
      "And the clinician was perplexed because if they were physical--\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think in that one I would get kind of pragmatic, and maybe with the millionaire as well, in the sense that we have limited clinical resources and treatment resources so, if they person is not presenting to treatment, if it's just a hypothetical thought experiment, I would not be bothering to diagnose them with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Same with the millionaire, but then the interesting thing to me is actually when they're coming in to treatment seeking.\n",
      "Once you're coming in for treatment, it's often time the case that you're having some distress or conflict about it, and at that point you've been the distress criteria and it doesn't matter if you have some weird management system, it's the clutter I guess that's the problem, not whether they're meeting interference or distress.\n",
      "So, I guess yeah maybe those two cases wouldn't be technically meeting for hoarding.\n",
      "I mean, definitely the digital person I would be probably not putting them down as hoarding, even though I can see why behaviorally, in terms of their beliefs, it's mimicking that and that the treatments could be quite similar.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "I don't keep trash.\n",
      "I'm not one that hoards a broken coffee pot or something, because I might use it later.\n",
      "That I would get rid of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what counts is trash for you?\n",
      "When you look at your stuff and you say, \"I can throw that out, that's trash.\"\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Now, that depends.\n",
      "Because some of the things that I've kept of my mother's, somebody else would say, \"That's trash.\"\n",
      "She was a great traveler around the United States when she was young.\n",
      "And that was the time of just railroads.\n",
      "And she kept a lot of the railroad schedules and I thought, \"Oh, somebody might like these.\n",
      "The people that collect railroad things or whatever.\"\n",
      "So I have those in a bag and I think about throwing them out, but I haven't done it, but it's really trash.\n",
      "But somebody else might like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you recognize that it's maybe not necessarily intrinsically valuable, somebody might be a collector of railway schedules?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "That's correct, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you, when you think about your home, do you feel like you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Oh yes.\n",
      "I felt like that for the past, let's see, I've lived in this house probably the last ... not for the whole time I've lived in this house, but maybe the past 25 to 30 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how do you know?\n",
      "Why do you think you have too much?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "How do I know?\n",
      "Because it's taking up too much room.\n",
      "It's storing stuff and it's preventing me from having a nice, neat house.\n",
      "It's preventing me from having people over, because I even get embarrassed, having somebody come in and fix the furnace or something.\n",
      "And as I get older, it's just a pain to have dust around these thing and go through them if I want to find something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever thought about getting help with your problems with clutter?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "I've thought about that.\n",
      "Well, I think I told you we had that little group, that's either four or five of us at the church.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "At your church.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But that didn't seem like it helped you.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "But interestingly enough, none of us wanted somebody else to go through our stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Everybody's private about their own stuff.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It's my clutter, I don't want you to tell me what to throw away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right, right.\n",
      "It's very personal to make that decision.\n",
      "Have you ever thought about going to a counselor or somebody who could help to talk to you about those sorts of issues to help you to do it?\n",
      "Or have you ever sought that about going to a professional organizer or somebody like that?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "I know that's available, but I don't think that's something I would turn to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. I have a few questions for you now about how hoarding disorder differs from what's typically normal saving behavior.\n",
      "Do you think there's any difference between normal collecting items and hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "You know, I don't know what the correct answer is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "There's no correct answer.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "I would think yeah there would be a difference.\n",
      "Collecting things, like my dad, he collects knives and coins and things, but he's not a hoarder.\n",
      "His house, he and his wife, there house is very orderly.\n",
      "I would say yes there is a difference between hoarding and being a collector.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It seems to be a level of organization might be what distinguishes it.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "That and, I mean with me it's not anything in particular, I just like to enjoy life and I like to have pretty things.\n",
      "I mean granted I have a lot of clothes and jewelry, but I like pretty things for my house too.\n",
      "It's not just any one thing.\n",
      "When you're a collector you're more focused on acquiring certain things, not everything in general.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's very clear.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "I'm sorry I have an allergy [crosstalk 00:48:53]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are you okay?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Is it mainly from TV, online?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah it's mostly, I've seen that show about hoarders and just random things online.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Now I have a few questions for you more about how this quarantine and working from home has impacted your life.\n",
      "Have you seen any changes in your acquiring during this time?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "I mean we don't get out as much, so definitely not acquiring.\n",
      "Although we do shop online.\n",
      "Yeah, I think it has slowed down.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Has there been any renewed energy or interest in cleaning out and donating or discarding items?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yes, but that comes in waves, it's not an everyday thing.\n",
      "It's like, \"Oh well I'm here, what's the rush,\" you know?\n",
      "I do think about it.\n",
      "You would have thought, I've been home since the middle of March, you would have thought I could have gone through that bedroom but part of the problem is I don't know what I'm going to do with that stuff, so going through it doesn't make it go away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah, so I have to figure out what I'm going to do with it, but I did go through some of it from time to time, and I did get rid of stuff.\n",
      "I mean I have a box now of stuff I'm going to donate, some clothes and shoes and some household items that I just know I'm not going to keep.\n",
      "It's kind of an ongoing thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it gotten easier to think about getting rid of items, or to kind of think, \"Oh yeah I may not need that,\" or to-\n",
      "Interviewer: And, I mean, that sort of brings us really nicely to the next part of the interview and I don't want to take up more of your time than I have a right to; so, cut us off when you're done.\n",
      "So, first of all, I guess I'll just jump right into, [NAME 56:03] published this paper about insight and hoarding, where he broke hoarding down into four different constructs, and the constructs are defensiveness; anosognosia, or the lack of ability to perceive an illness or that anything is wrong; overvalued ideation, which is believing that your items are more valuable than they are; or indifference.\n",
      "And I wonder, when you think about insight, which of these 4 do you think about most?\n",
      "Which do you kind of experience with patients most?\n",
      "Interviewee: I'm sorry, could you just go through them one more time for me?\n",
      "Overvalued ideation, what were the other three?\n",
      "Interviewer: Overvalued ideation, so believing your items are more valuable than they truly are; anosognosia, which is being unable to perceive your illness or that something is wrong, causing distress, so kind of like illness blindness.\n",
      "So, if somebody's had a stroke they don't notice that their left side is not responding.\n",
      "Defensiveness, which is kind of related to not acknowledging it because they're worried about losing their things; and indifference, so saying, \"I know that this space is unacceptable by most people's standards, but I don't care and I'm happy with it.\"\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay, so are you asking which is the most common or which is the hardest to deal with?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, both I guess but mostly what do you think of when you think of insight in hoarding disorder.\n",
      "All four of those or are there one or two that jump out at you as being, kind of, at the root of the problem?\n",
      "Interviewee: I guess I kind of think of all of them, except for maybe--well, yeah I think of all of them to some extent.\n",
      "I've seen them all in different clients.\n",
      "Definitely the defensiveness, I think there's a lot of clients if you push past their concern and their fear and their anxiety, they know it's a problem.\n",
      "Definitely the indifference, that's been coming up with some really low insight, like they just don't care.\n",
      "And overvalued ideation, its like, \"Yeah, I care but it's obviously not--\".\n",
      "I probably would say defensiveness and overvalued ideation would be my top two.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, part of the reason that I'm asking you is both anosognosia, or illness blindness, and overvalued ideation almost sound like delusions.\n",
      "So, like is the problem of insight in hoarding in your mind like, \"I'm looking at my room full of stuff and I truly truly cannot see how bad it is\" like, in the sense of a delusion.\n",
      "Or--\n",
      "Interviewee: That's why I don't fully buy the illness one.\n",
      "But yeah, I do think that sometimes the thinking in hoarding is so skewed that it gets to the border of delusion.\n",
      "Like an example would be a hoarding client who saves Easter eggs that she wanted to give to the neighborhood kids four years ago, and now they're rotten and bad, and she still can't throw them out and she has fantasies of just running down the street and throwing them on the ground because it would be less upsetting to her than throwing them in the bin.\n",
      "Like, on some level it's crossing to this line of insight in delusionality that these rotten Easter eggs are still something meaningful and worth saving.\n",
      "Like that overvalued ideation, it's yeah, not quite normal cognition.\n",
      "026\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "So now we're going to get into the more fun, conversational part of the interview.\n",
      "And I would just like to start by having you tell me a little bit about your experience with clutter problems, when it started and how it went on and what it's like for you now?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I certainly didn't experience it as a child.\n",
      "Or in high school or college or even in my twenties and thirties.\n",
      "I think it probably started after I had children, and I was 37 when I had my first.\n",
      "It was very hard for me to throw things away, I found a lot of their things meaningful and difficult to part with.\n",
      "And also I didn't have the time to devote to decluttering.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "So things just kind of piled up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So with you, this problem was kind of related to being a parent?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you didn't find that prior to having children you had any problems with getting rid of things at all?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No, thinking back, not really.\n",
      "I was pretty good about going through papers and not accumulating things.\n",
      "The other issue is I had a number of eye surgeries that started actually right after I had my daughter, she was eight weeks old.\n",
      "I had cataract surgery and then I had retinal detachments.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "And so my vision was somewhat compromised, so it's a little harder for me to read and focus.\n",
      "So that has contributed to the accumulation of paperwork and newspapers, and things that I have been meaning to read but haven't gotten to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like there are a couple of things that contributed to this all starting, so first it was just having your kids and finding the items associated with them were very sentimental for you.\n",
      "And then at the same time you had this problem with your eyesight, so it was harder for you to go through papers, and you kept meaning to go through them and then not being able to because of the differences, changes in your vision.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so that's kind of exacerbated it and made it sort of all start.\n",
      "How is the behavior now as compared to when it began, do you feel like it's gotten worse over time or it's pretty much been the same the whole time?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "It's better.\n",
      "My kids are both out of the house so I can't use them as an excuse.\n",
      "I'm choosing not to accumulate a lot more things including reading material, I've canceled magazine subscriptions, I don't get the newspaper, I get it digitally so there's nothing to pile up.\n",
      "There's still a backlog of paperwork that I need to deal with and I just frankly don't feel like dealing with it because there's a lot of decision making that would be involved.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I have a really hard time with that.\n",
      "So sometimes it's just that I recognize that we have a space issue or my partner will sort of try to push me toward that.\n",
      "And so that's really cool.\n",
      "Sorry, I got interrupted.\n",
      "That's really cool.\n",
      "And so I think...\n",
      "So I have a lot of bivalence but if I see that as I said, space is an issue, I'm not using something, I remind myself, it's inanimate, it's not going to be upset with me or sad, but that's very hard for me.\n",
      "So I try to use cognitive behavioral therapy to sort of talk myself through rationally getting rid of it.\n",
      "It's much easier for me to donate things than to actually throw them away.\n",
      "So it's helpful if I could donate it Getting rid of it, it's much easier for me to donate things than to actually throw them away.\n",
      "So it's helpful if I could donate and think, \"Okay, somebody else can use this.\"\n",
      "And it can be better used by somebody else than just putting it in a landfill.\n",
      "That upsets me for the item and it upsets me for the world because we already have to [waste 00:40:10] problems so it's much harder for me to throw things away.\n",
      "But sometimes, that's what you have to do if it's an old shirt with holes in it, you really can't donate that.\n",
      "Sometimes my partner will tell me to take a picture of it or, it's okay and just get rid of it.\n",
      "And I find that, of course, even though I think I'm going to be tormented, I don't even remember all the things that I've thrown away.\n",
      "I'm not tormented.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "So you would say, even though if it's difficult to get rid of some of the stuff that you know deep down and don't really mean much to you, you try to bring it down to, okay.\n",
      "What do I find valuable?\n",
      "What really means the most to me?\n",
      "And then that's kind of how you go through your process.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And what am I going to actually use?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Or be able to keep in an organized way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So what do you think are the most important differences between normal saving behavior and like collecting and then hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewer: So they kind of personify or over-empathize with objects.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, whereas actually letting an animal go is actually killing it or potentially killing it, the greatest anxiety a lot of the animal hoarders have is their animals will be taken away and euthanized, and the reality is it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophesy because the animals deteriorate.\n",
      "We're pretty good at bringing hoarder dogs back to reasonable health, we're not very good at rescuing hoarded cats because of high instances of colony blind diseases and they're just generally more fragile and don't do nearly as well in hoarding situations, the mortality rates tend to be higher.\n",
      "So first of all, whereas your collection of coasters isn't going to reciprocate your presumed love and affection, but the dog does, and so because animals obviously even when kept under very poor conditions will still display affection to their inadequate care giver, that reinforces their notion of \"I must be a good person because this dog loves me.\"\n",
      "And I have lots of videos of hoarders picking up the dogs and the dogs lick their face, \"so how can you say I'm a bad owner?\n",
      "My dog loves me.\"\n",
      "So that's something you never get in pure object hoarding.\n",
      "The objects may bring them joy but a hoarded animal gives what looks like love, so that's a major difference.\n",
      "Interviewer: It does sound like you see them as different kinds of the same thing, or at least of existing on a spectrum.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right, the depth of potential attachment to an animal is obviously much stronger, and then in terms of being the public health aspect as I said, you know, animals pee and poor and reproduce and die, which your toasters don't.\n",
      "022\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Then there are going to be three parts to this interview.\n",
      "The first part is just basic questions.\n",
      "The first one is, what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Male, female or intersex?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I'm sorry you cut out for a second there.\n",
      "Could you say that again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, of course.\n",
      "What was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then what is your highest degree or level of education that you've completed?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "BA. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is your household income?\n",
      "You can give it in a range.\n",
      "It doesn't have to be exact.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh, for now?\n",
      "[inaudible 00:01:02] $140K.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then which geographic region best describes where you live in the US: Northeast Midwest, South or West?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "West.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, thank you.\n",
      "Before we actually begin the more interview part of this, what is your preferred term that we use when we're talking about your difficulties discarding clutter?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Wait, I'm sorry.\n",
      "You cut again.\n",
      "It keeps doing that.\n",
      "Could you try it again please?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, of course.\n",
      "We just wanted to know what term you would prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Hoarder, hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Junk packer.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, some people have a preference, so we just like to ask.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah, no. What's wrong with you?\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "That completes the free listing section.\n",
      "This next section is going to be more conversational style.\n",
      "It's just separated into five different topics.\n",
      "This first topic is me discussing behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "If you could please describe your hoarding problems and how long have they been going on?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "My whole life?\n",
      "No. Probably maybe 20 years, 25 years.\n",
      "Actually, I've really made these great strides lately, but just to hold stuff that I might need in the future or that I did pay too much for.\n",
      "I didn't want to get rid of it.\n",
      "I grew up without a whole lot so I think every time I buy something, it was a promise to myself.\n",
      "I felt if I didn't finish a task or complete a project that I bought something for, I would keep it because it was a promise.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How severe would you say your behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Right now?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I'm really proud of myself right now because of coronavirus.\n",
      "I couldn't go anywhere, so I've been doing it less.\n",
      "Probably now it is moderate.\n",
      "It was pretty severe up until about three months ago, not horrible but bad.\n",
      "Does that makes sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: So I'll give you a typical picture, a lot of what you said resonates with everybody's kind of idea.\n",
      "They'll say like a person who talks a lot and talks kind of tangentially and seems like they have trouble zeroing in on the topic of conversation sometimes, like you said, very frazzled, they tend to be kind of like get overly emotionally empathetic or overly involved in other people's lives and business and drama, they are always late for everything, they always have a ton of stuff with them everywhere they go, they are very disorganized in every aspect of their life, so they can't manage their calendar, stuff like that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and I guess the positive aspect of that that sometimes goes along with it is they do some--not everyone, but again as a stereotype, really interested in things and kind of creative.\n",
      "So, really like, \"What is this lecture series that's happening?\" Or \"Why are you answering that question?\" Or \"I saw on my way in that they're doing a rally for this\" so just kind of generally, I would say on the positive side, creative, intellectually curious kind of people would be the counter point in terms of things you see that are kind of fun and nice about hoarding clients, I find.\n",
      "Interviewer: It's interesting too, and I don't know if this is just because the people I've interviewed generally like all of their clients, but I feel like experts in hoarding disorder, as you just did, often go out of their way to say like, \"Actually there's really nice things about these people as well.\"\n",
      "Interviewee: I hope it's not because we all perceive there to be a stigma against it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, maybe, I don't know I just--\n",
      "Interviewee: Which I think there is.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, there definitely is, but I've definitely had the experience of clinicians often times kind of pointing out the creative and interesting aspect of people with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, oh good.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, anyway,\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean that's probably the reason some of us have chosen to work with it as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, there's a bias there for sure.\n",
      "So, just to kind of dive into the rest of our interview script, if you wouldn't mind just giving me like a two minute overview of your experience in terms of this disorder and, you know, if you see patients clinically, if you're mostly involved with research.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay, so, starting in Graduate school I was running hoarding treatment groups supervised by [NAME 23:07] and then decided to do that as my PhD research and from that time on, have done a series of studies over the last two decades.\n",
      "I guess the first one would've been 2003-ish, so not quite two decades, decade and a half.\n",
      "Studies on hoarding, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, treatment of hoarding.\n",
      "And while that has happened, I've been doing some treatment of hoarding, a little bit of clinical work, but much more research and supervision.\n",
      "So, I supervise, my most recent clinical experience is that I supervise the weakly hoarding treatment groups through a community center and also through units at my university clinic.\n",
      "So, we meet regularly and go through all the hoarding clients and that's been going on for three of four years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Along those lines, and this is similar to the free listing, but do you think there's some way to tell someone has hoarding disorder without being exactly in their home?\n",
      "Maybe just by talking to them?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Talking to them?\n",
      "No, I don't think so.\n",
      "I really don't.\n",
      "I think that most people, if they are true hoarders, they hide it.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "I really think that they do, unless it's so totally out of control, but I think for the most part people ...\n",
      "Because you don't set out to be this, you don't set out to have this problem in your life, this extra stuff, but I think that it becomes overwhelming, but you hide it from other people as much as you can.\n",
      "I don't think you can tell usually just talking to people.\n",
      "I think to me, the one way that you can usually tell is by their car.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh. Participant 022:\n",
      "If there's all this stuff in their car, \"Why do you have all this stuff in here,\" like trash and stuff that you don't dispose of, that you should dispose of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Where did you get most of your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Where did you hear about it?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Where did I hear about it?\n",
      "You mean, live it?\n",
      "There was that show that was on TV, about the hoarders and I thought, \"Oh my God, what kind of people are those,\" and all of a sudden, I think it made me realize, \"Oh, that's what you are because look at your basement.\n",
      "Look at what you're doing and how you're not enjoying your life because you're so worried about people finding out about all this stuff.\"\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "I read some articles online about it, I think, is probably what I did.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you remember at what point in your life that was?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I'm sorry, say that again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "At what point in your life did that happen?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Probably maybe about 10 years ago, 12 years ago.\n",
      "It took me a long time to come to grips with it really a long time.\n",
      "It's something I thought about.\n",
      "I think I have books on hoarding and organizing your life and stuff.\n",
      "I read them, but I don't do anything.\n",
      "I never pull it through.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Does it really?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I feel like that's a frequent response.\n",
      "A lot of people that I've interviewed so far, they've been like, \"Oh, I have all these books and I read them all,\" and they're like, \"But I didn't use it.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It can be hard to determine how you're going to feel before a situation occurs.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Right, but I do think about that.\n",
      "We're in a flood zone in Florida, and we're in a hurricane spot.\n",
      "So all the pictures that are down there and all things that are down there, there's duplicates up here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "The other thing is we don't carry insurance like house insurance.\n",
      "If something happens to this house, I have the land, but we have the other house in Florida.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Having that extra house is kind of an actual security blanket.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I guess I kind of... I know that I live my life with backups and with being prepared and that's one thing of course the Coast Guard teaches.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:52:57] is Semper Paratus, so I'm always prepared.\n",
      "That is why I buy duplicates of items that I know I'm going to want or I'm going to use for probably the rest of my life.\n",
      "It was probably about 30 years ago, I found these plastic baskets with a handle and I bought all they had, which was 12.\n",
      "I have only given one of those away and it took a lot for me to give that one away, and didn't she go throw it in a trash.\n",
      "Those plastic baskets have stood up all these years for going to the beach, for wherever.\n",
      "Buying multiples of something that is on...\n",
      "They were on clearance, so buying multiples of something that is on clearance makes me feel like I'm as prepared as I could be for whatever might happen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, gotcha.\n",
      "How do you decide when you think you have...\n",
      "Or how do you decide when you have too much?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "No, wait a minute.\n",
      "When I can't fit any more clothes in my drawers or... I also bought these tall Rubbermaid things that have handles that are very handy for storing sweatshirts and sweaters and stuff like that.\n",
      "I pretty much ran out of space with clothes and so I can take bags of clothes to Goodwill.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So running out of space in places like drawers if you have too many clothes.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah, and then the other thing was that I didn't fit into those clothes anymore.\n",
      "I still have clothes that I wore when I was in seventh grade and I'm now 74.\n",
      "I could still wear those clothes as of probably maybe 10 years ago.\n",
      "Since then I have put on a little weight.\n",
      "I am 97 pounds, so I'm not...\n",
      "But I used to be 84 pounds.\n",
      "If I absolutely cannot get into them and I weigh 97 pounds or if they're itchy or I don't like them, then I can take them to Goodwill.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewer: The really extreme example is a, I read an article in the newspaper about a couple who died whose home was absolutely impassable and was filled to the brim with their art collection, and their art collection turned out to be valued at millions and millions of dollars, they were actually art collectors and they had a lot of knowledge, you know, they had Picassos and Matisse, and all kinds of stuff, but completely not on display, filling their home, making their rooms jam-packed, and they knew where the stuff was and they knew what they had but it was not organized.\n",
      "Interviewee: That's a great extreme example, what did people do with that one?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah,\n",
      "Interviewee: Are you just an art collector with not enough space?\n",
      "Because if they had more space and more assistance and stuff to organize it, it is all valuable art.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, yeah, I mean--\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, they're still disorganized about it, they're still chaotic about it, they're still letting it get in the way of their functioning.\n",
      "That's a great example.\n",
      "Interviewer: And where do you think that would fall?\n",
      "I mean, how would you make that call?\n",
      "Interviewee: How I would make that call is I would probably need to go into their home and see what's happening.\n",
      "So if it was the case that they had a small apartment but they were really finding all these amazing things and it was just starting to impede on their space, I probably wouldn't give them a diagnosis.\n",
      "But if it had that chaotic nature where they weren't doing any problem solving, they were collecting other stuff that was, I don't know.\n",
      "I don't think I would diagnose it in that case, possibly.\n",
      "I'm going to say maybe no. Are they still able to--I mean how severe has it gotten in terms of the use of their home?\n",
      "Are they not sleeping in their beds, are they not using their showers, are they not cooking because they have art everywhere, literally?\n",
      "Or is it just pretty crowded because of all the art?\n",
      "Interviewer: My understanding from the newspaper article that I read was that it was like every square inch of their home was jam-packed, but like I wasn't there so I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewee: So, they really were kind of having to squish their way through.\n",
      "They really couldn't do anything in their home.\n",
      "Interviewer: I mean, where this is reflected in the DSM-V is the difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value, and I guess I'm wondering like, is the inability to properly evaluate or value items a necessary part of the disorder or not?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, and I guess if you just go back to our general psychiatric classification system and try and step back from hoarding per se, it's still a disorder if they're not functioning in their home.\n",
      "If they're not able to bathe and they're not eating well, and they're feeling distraught and embarrassed to have people over, then there's still something that's gone wrong there there.\n",
      "It's a weird case of hoarding because everything's valuable, but it seems like it is a disorder and what disorder could it be besides hoarding?\n",
      "If they're getting to the point where it really is making them miserable and/or unable to function.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah I'm getting better as I get older, because I know none of it goes with us when we leave this world.\n",
      "I'm learning to be content with less.\n",
      "It's not about stuff.\n",
      "It's really about what life is about for me.\n",
      "It's not about stuff.\n",
      "It's about people, about relationships and memories and experiences.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is this something, like a mentality that you've acquired you think with getting older, or has this especially happened over this period where you are unable to see as many people?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No, no, no. This is something that comes with maturity, I believe.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How are you doing since about mid March with your physical health?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well I put on a few extra pounds, but otherwise, a little depressed, if you want to know the real truth, a little bit depressed, because I'm a people person and I like social interaction, so it's difficult to be isolated.\n",
      "Otherwise, I know it will all come to an end at some point, so we make the best of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Has this time affected your family financially at all?\n",
      "Has that been an extra stressor?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah, it has.\n",
      "We had a business that my husband was doing, and it's only about four years old so it wasn't a really big, huge, thriving business, but nevertheless it was a business that he was diligently working to build.\n",
      "It sort of has died.\n",
      "I mean a little bit trickles in here and there, but that has died off, that source of income has died off.\n",
      "It wasn't ever a big source of income but it was something, and it's all but gone now.\n",
      "He's had to go take work outside the home, and then I have taken on a part time job.\n",
      "Yeah we have kind of mode, since all this started, to get our debts paid off, and get situated with our finances.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's good to hear that you guys were able to find jobs during this period.\n",
      "I know that can be rough.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like it was almost helpful, in a way, to have to find a job in order to interact with people?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I like it.\n",
      "I don't know, he complains about it, but I think it's good for both of us, I do.\n",
      "Actually I was sick during the month of July and this job that I have, it's real flexible so I can pick and choose when I want to work, so I wasn't able to work for about three weeks because I had allergy symptoms and I had to get tested for COVID and it was negative but that all took some time so I couldn't go back to work for like three weeks.\n",
      "I've just started working back this week.\n",
      "I've missed having that social interaction, getting out of the house and being around people.\n",
      "I think I told you this last week.\n",
      "That some of them are collections because they don't have any emotional ties to them.\n",
      "Part of it might have emotional ties, but the rest of them don't.\n",
      "Because I don't know if you're familiar with the little Hallmark Christmas ornaments things?\n",
      "When did they start that?\n",
      "20 years ago, or so.\n",
      "I collected those that had to do with old time houses and that.\n",
      "And that was a collection, which I still have, but I have it in a box and thinking this, when they open up or I can donate things, I can donate it.\n",
      "That was a collection.\n",
      "Although, the collection I've got left of the antique bottles, some of those I don't think I'd part with until the day I die or something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like you have several collections.\n",
      "And they're collections because you don't feel necessarily that you've got them because of emotional attachment, but because you were looking for this kind of item.\n",
      "And so for example, with your Hallmark ornaments, you could give those away, because even though you collected them, you're not attached to them.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "That's correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But the bottles, even though it's a collection, you still feel emotionally attached to the bottles.\n",
      "Is that because you collected them with your husband and there are memories attached to acquiring them?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you feel like you are-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Although some things ... well, you see, I collected those, but I never did anything with them.\n",
      "So in my thinking, that's kind of hoarding because I never put them out.\n",
      "I never made them a little scenery or something at Christmas time.\n",
      "I never did anything with them.\n",
      "I would think, \"Oh, I like this.\"\n",
      "And then I put it in a box and I'd pile them up in this box.\n",
      "So that was hoarding, because I never did anything with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "And that's true of several things actually.\n",
      "And that's hoarding because I never showed it to anybody.\n",
      "I never did anything with it.\n",
      "I just hoarded it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So for you, the difference is that you haven't used the items and they're not on display, they're just in a box somewhere.\n",
      "And that makes it-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yeah, they're of no use.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Although I have a whole half closet full of pants, which they could be Levi's, they could be nice pants, whatever that I would just buy because I liked it.\n",
      "And I thought, \"Oh, I'll wear this sometime.\"\n",
      "But I've never worn it.\n",
      "So that's hoarding too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So kind of having things that you don't use or even look at, that's where it-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yeah, but I know that they're there.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Did it ever affect your relationship with your children?\n",
      "Did they adopt this behavior as well?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No. My kids are the total opposite.\n",
      "This is my theory is that when you grow up and you have everything that you want, you don't value things.\n",
      "There was maybe three things or something that I think my son told me he wanted.\n",
      "He put a colored sticky note on it for when I die that this is his.\n",
      "My daughter, absolutely nothing, she wants nothing at all.\n",
      "She did take a teapot recently that was my mother-in-law's and I was so shocked that she took it.\n",
      "We have a hot tub and I'm trying to give it to her, \"I don't want it.\n",
      "I don't want it.\n",
      "I don't want it.\"\n",
      "She doesn't want anything.\n",
      "She really does not it.\n",
      "She rents a house.\n",
      "She doesn't want anything permanent.\n",
      "She's the total opposite of me and my son is like that too.\n",
      "They just don't want things.\n",
      "They don't value things the way I do or my husband does.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned that you had multiple sisters.\n",
      "You had four sisters, right?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Were your parents like this at all?\n",
      "Do any of your sisters have this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "That's interesting to think about.\n",
      "I think one sister has it little bit.\n",
      "She buys stuff and she can't find it or she's so disorganized that she has to buy it again and again and again.\n",
      "I don't know if that's necessarily hoarding as much as it is just having a messy life.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I think all of us probably buy too much, all five of us, but I think I'm probably the worst by a long shot.\n",
      "I have the disposable income that they don't have too.\n",
      "I think that's part of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Did your parents also save a lot?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No, no. My mom was an alcoholic, so there wasn't a value put on anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about your husband?\n",
      "Did any of his family members save a lot also?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "His mom.\n",
      "His mom was really, really a saver.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I think it was nine dumpsters when I cleaned her house out when she went in the nursing home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Unbelievable.\n",
      "They lived in the house for 50 years.\n",
      "She saved every Good Housekeeping magazine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh, I know.\n",
      "Behind the couch, behind the couch.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How difficult was that for you and your husband when you had to help his mother clean?\n",
      "I guess she didn't really help.\n",
      "But was that difficult to get rid of those items?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No. It really was pretty easy actually because it wasn't mine.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. Ok. Are there any situations then, where you’ve had to help patients try to gain insight or go through that with them?\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean, we’ve definitely tried to improve on their insight, for sure.\n",
      "But by the time they come to us, they have some awareness that this is an issue, some awareness that they need to do something about it.\n",
      "Oftentimes people with hoarding will admit that they have a problem with clutter and too much stuff, but they’re often blaming other people for it.\n",
      "You know, “it’s because I’ve worked all my life and never had time to take care of it.”\n",
      "Or “I don’t have time to take care of it because of the kids.”\n",
      "Or “I don’t have time to take care of it for some other reason.”\n",
      "They’re always blaming outside sources so that would be a marginal insight that there’s an issue, but it’s not their fault.\n",
      "Uhm so it’s a huge gamut of insight, I think.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "It seems that way.\n",
      "And how would you help a patient try to gain insight or move further in that path towards recognition of the problem and the relationship with the disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Here we do a lot of education.\n",
      "So, in the first week that they’re in the program- and I do this in my private practice too- I do extensive evaluation of what hoarding is and what it looks like and how it manifests on a day to day level.\n",
      "I do a lot of assessment and rating scales and give them feedback on those rating scales.\n",
      "And then talk about treatment and the rationales of treatment, what treatment looks like and what we hope it’s going to do.\n",
      "So, it’s kind of developing insight, but also developing motivation and having them buy into the treatment plan.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. And so, when your patients will come in with a greater degree of insight, the ones that do, how do you think that they came to that insight or that understanding on their own, of their problem?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s usually when, again, outside sources have been pushing them; family has kind of done an intervention or have been on their case, or a landlord has intervened and said something, or there’s been a threat-\n",
      "Interviewer: Some kind of external source\n",
      "Interviewee: Usually some external source makes them sit up and think “ok, this has gone on long enough, I have to do something about it”\n",
      "We’ve had several patients where there’s been a risk of children being taken away, and that’s obviously been a huge motivation for them.\n",
      "Uhm risk of eviction, or having to move to a new house and realizing they can’t, or a husband threatening to leave- that one doesn’t do it so much for some reason- but uhm, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: But, let's turn to that distress criteria because the answer you gave about distress and seeking treatment is common.\n",
      "The genesis of this project is the problem of insight and the problem that you have a lot of patients with hoarding disorder who, you know, if you think about the kind of stereotypical example of a hoarding patient with low insight, has a house that's completely hoarded out, that's completely filled with stuff, lives fairly socially isolated, and until there's an external source of pressure, is happy living that way, at least in their own mind; so, they're not seeking treatment.\n",
      "So, with that person, where's the distress?\n",
      "Interviewee: I guess, for me, I allow it to be the distress that brought them into treatment, which may not be--you're absolutely right--distress about the stuff they have, but distress about the issues that have resulted from it.\n",
      "So for me I'm perfectly happy that the distress they come in with is, \"I'm going to be evicted, people are yelling at me, my sister's trying to make me throw out my stuff\" is hoarding related, but you're right, it's not the distress they have about having too much stuff, it's whatever external issues have happened around that.\n",
      "So, to me, the hoarding itself in my mind is causing the distress in their life, they think the distress is related to people won't leave them alone or the landlord is being unreasonable or their spouse wants to divorce them for unfair reasons.\n",
      "But to me, hoarding is causing distress, and whether or not it's the hoarding directly to distress of the hoarding to impacting other people to distress, is important clinically, but not what I use to make the diagnosis.\n",
      "So, if it's causing distress in their life, I don't need them to have insight necessarily that it's the hoarding yet, because there is so much low insight.\n",
      "But still in the grand scheme, again, what is psychopathology and where is our role as clinicians in diagnosing and helping people?\n",
      "It fits in my mind, this person is experiencing pain because of this problem they have, even if it's indirect.\n",
      "Interviewer: And in a hypothetical scenario where the person doesn't have that conflict, so owns a home, doesn't have a landlord, lives in an isolated enough place that no one is contacting their space, that wouldn't fit criteria for you.\n",
      "So, would that person have hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, it would, it would still fit criteria for me.\n",
      "I guess I was talking more about the scenarios where they're coming in for treatment and not saying distress, that it would be easy.\n",
      "But yeah, if I was then doing some sort of interview and I showed up to their house in Iceland and it was like, \"I'm doing a community nationwide survey of hoarding\" and I looked at their house and I saw that they were saving, I would still diagnose it as hoarding low insight.\n",
      "So, but they have the mansion, right, so yeah that is a tricky one.\n",
      "What's the interference?\n",
      "It’d be good if you could start doing like global interference, like it's interfering because it's taking up huge amounts of resources and it has a major environmental impact to have four mansions in Iceland with your stuff, even if you don't realize it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, when you look at let's say, the folding table in your family room and you look at the papers that are on it and you pick one up, how would you know if it was something you needed to keep and save and go through or if it was something that you could just put straight in the trash?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "All of it truthfully, can go in the trash, but I just feel this compulsion to read what's there, and I don't mean cover to cover just kind of scanning and seeing if I missed anything.\n",
      "And it's a little bit irrational.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you recognize that you're not necessarily going to read every word but when you pick it up even though you know you don't need to save it, you like to just look through it and to make sure that there's not information there that you could use?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "That's a big part of it, yeah.\n",
      "But also I'm just curious, I love to read, I'm kind of a news junkie, so-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's true curiosity, you're actually interested in whatever is on there?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah it's a form of entertainment I would say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "But then when the paper gets moldy or damaged in some way then you're totally fine with not even looking at it, just tossing it in the trash?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, now I'm going to start to ask you some questions about hoarding disorder, which is not the behavior that you're describing.\n",
      "Again part of this interview is to understand how people think about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So when you think about hoarding disorder, how would you distinguish somebody who has a problem with saving, like in hoarding disorder from somebody who has more normal saving behavior like maybe somebody who has a collection?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I would say the hoarding is more of an irrational thing.\n",
      "That it's just a compulsion to save things, and my grandmother was that way, so I'm kind of familiar with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So in hoarding disorder as opposed to collecting, there's not really that rational cognition behind it, it's all just a kind of impulse.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, and I think with collecting there's an element of pleasure there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So people who have hoarding disorder don't take pleasure in the same way as a collector in their items?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "They just have to save them even if they might not want them.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you said you had experience in this with your grandmother, could you describe what you feel like hoarding disorder looks like and how you know when somebody has it?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Well you mean in her case?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "In any case, yeah, or wherever you have experience with it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How severe would you say your behavior is now?\n",
      "Do you think it's a problem?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "It's not a problem for me other than the fact that I a lot of times can't find things.\n",
      "I think it's severe in that sense, and I'm starting to think that... and for my age it doesn't really matter too much anymore, but I'm thinking that maybe it's attention deficit disorder, because I've noticed that a lot of times I'll be interested in something and I'll buy it, and then once I get it, it's a good feeling, I got it.\n",
      "But then it sits there and I lose interest in it.\n",
      "I don't know if that's part of the hoarding thing or what, but...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How long does it take you to lose interest in an item?\n",
      "Is it like a week or a day or honestly after you get it, in the next few hours you're kind of like, \"Oh, oh well.\"\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "It depends on the item.\n",
      "Sometimes I'll lose interest in a matter of a day.\n",
      "Other times I may use it a couple of times and then I lose interest in it.\n",
      "The paintings, if I buy some paintings, I basically bring them home and put them up against the wall.\n",
      "I don't hang them up.\n",
      "I just pretty much put them in a room and that's it.\n",
      "I sort of forget about them.\n",
      "So those, I lose interest in them real fast.\n",
      "What are you going to do with the painting?\n",
      "I don't have a spot to put them in, and it's like, okay, one day I think I'll go through all of these and research each one of them, and maybe I'll find something valuable.\n",
      "It depends on the item.\n",
      "I recently bought a drone because I thought it would be fun to fly that, and I got that and I've never opened the box and even assembled it.\n",
      "I'm going to but I lost interest in that pretty quickly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do any of your family or friends get upset over your behavior, or have you had conflicts with them about it?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "No, because I don't have a lot of family left, and my sisters are all kind of far away, so it's not like they come over often.\n",
      "It's more of I visit them on holidays and stuff.\n",
      "So it's not something that I broadcast when I get together with them, that, \"Oh, yeah, I've got 50 paintings laying around the house I don't know what to do with.\"\n",
      "I generally don't bring it up, so I don't even think they're aware of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about any of your friends or neighbors?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And I'd like to talk about your home now.\n",
      "What is your favorite place in your home?\n",
      "Where do you spend most of the time when you're at home?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "I would say in the computer room.\n",
      "Computer room and kitchen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So that's interesting because you said the computer room is one of the most cluttered places and the-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yeah, because that's where the computer is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So that's where you put all your stuff that you're working on.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Or a lot of stuff that I might use.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And you like to have it nearby you in case you want to use it?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like a book, books or papers, or, although there's a lot of things from my childhood in that room too, on display.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So you kind of-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "And the closets, well, part of one has clothes in.\n",
      "The other part has Christmas things in and up above that, it's all craft things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So it s-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Which at one time, let's say at one time I was interested in Teddy bears and I learned how to make Teddy bears.\n",
      "And so I have all the things to make a Teddy bear.\n",
      "But when my interest wanes, I don't get rid of it.\n",
      "I just stash it away somewhere.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "That totally makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "And it sounds like the computer room is a place where you have two things, you have the items from your childhood that you like to look at and have on display because they feel good to you emotionally.\n",
      "And then you also have all of the items that you have to do all of the activities, which are interesting to you or that you might need to do in that room.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And do you like to be in there?\n",
      "I mean, do you like to sit in your computer room and look at your items around you?\n",
      "Does that feel-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "I didn't get that, you faded out a little bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I said, is that a place that you like to be, I mean, does sitting in that room feel comfortable and at home for you?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, I'm in there because I'm using the computer and now of course, now I'm in there a lot because I'm getting a lot of information on the virus and all these other things and communicating with people on learning how to use Zoom and all that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. So, I’m going to read you the first one and then I just want to know about your thought process in terms of how you apply it to individual patients.\n",
      "So, the first one that were interested in is “Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value.”\n",
      "And so, we were kind of wondering about the process of evaluation for hoarding disorder and how you look at, you know, the possessions that a person has accumulated and determine value, and whether it’s appropriate or not.\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "If I’m understanding the question correctly, I usually would start by asking people what kinds of things they tend to collect, their usual response is “everything,” so I kind of have to break it down.\n",
      "And then just asking over and over again “What would happen if you didn’t have this stuff?” “Are you afraid if you didn’t have this?” “What would happen if you lost this stuff?” Or “What would happen if you couldn’t find it?” Uhm just asking the same question in a million different ways, just to really see what their response would be.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what’s the response of a typical patient with hoarding disorder to that question?\n",
      "Interviewee: “It’s important,” “It’s valuable,” “I’ll need it later…”\n",
      "[cross talk]\n",
      "Interviewer: [inaudible 00:26:58] so they can separate it from obsessive compulsive disorder where they might be more afraid that there will be some consequences or uhm is that why the purpose of that question?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think yes, and, you know, some people with Obsessive Compulsive disorder might throw things away, but they’re going to save something like-- you know they throw it away because its contaminated, or they might say they’re going to keep it because they can’t touch it because its contaminated, or they keep it because their rituals prevent them touching it- like they can’t take the trash out because they can’t touch the trash.\n",
      "So, there will be other reasons why they’re accumulating the stuff, but they will be very clear that they don’t really want it, it’s just that they can’t, for some reason or another, get rid of it.\n",
      "Whereas someone with hoarding is actively trying to keep hold if it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So, for you, this criteria kind of- it gets at this question of whether people are valuing their items in an appropriate way.\n",
      "And that, for you, is kind of very a key distinguishing factor for distinguishing hoarding from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder [inaudible 00:28:14].\n",
      "Interviewee: Right!\n",
      "Well some people don’t throw things away because they’re afraid that there’s something in it.\n",
      "But they can’t articulate what it is that’s in this bag, or in this envelope or in this pizza box, and then it’s a fine line- is this hoarding or is this OCD?\n",
      "Because it’s a fear that they’re throwing something of value away- which, that’s what a lot of hoarders say- but that has a much more OCD flavor, in that they have to check everything a hundred times- they can get rid of it, but they spend 20 minutes checking the pizza box to see if there’s something in it; so, then it’s got a slightly different flavor.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I think the differences is, a lot of times there is a gray area, but I think it's quality of life.\n",
      "You can say with extremes, if it interferes with your ability to use your home or to have someone into your home or to keep up your home, repair it, then obviously that's a problem.\n",
      "That's a problem.\n",
      "But I think in the gray area, it becomes even an issue, as I said, with quality of life or you don't want to host people or you feel stress about hosting because you have to clean and prepare and do those kinds of things first.\n",
      "So I think in the starting of that gray area of a problem, if it affects your ability.\n",
      "Where it starts affecting social interactions, and hosting, and relationships within the family.\n",
      "If there's tension over too much stuff and getting rid of it, then I think even though objectively, it isn't like interfering with health at that point, it's still it's becomes through the relationship dynamics and quality of life.\n",
      "It's becoming a problem.\n",
      "It's something that needs to be addressed for highest quality of life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So would you say that collecting to hoarding is kind of like on a spectrum and there is this gray area between the two where things might start developing and becoming a problem, but it's when things like safety, quality of life, deteriorating relationships come into play, where that might be more considered on the hoarding side than collecting.\n",
      "Would you agree?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And I mean, I do see it all as like a continuum.\n",
      "It's just where you are and when it starts affecting somebody's life enough that it's really interfering with the quality of their life then it's becoming a problem.\n",
      "Yeah, but it's all that sort of that continuum.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "So you've kind of described a little bit about what hoarding disorder looks like, but can you kind of go into detail a little bit more and how is this the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have the people living with you changed?\n",
      "It sounds like your daughters came home for a time?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah she's a medical student, and so she was home for four months because they didn't have enough PPE to go around.\n",
      "But the called them back on July 6th, so she's back now.\n",
      "Sorry?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So your daughter was there for a period of time during the quarantine but is no longer there?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Correct, although we did go down to see her last week and we spent about four or five days with her which was very nice.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's nice, yeah.\n",
      "Have you been able to be successful in keeping in contact with family and friends?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I have been, I haven't really seen them but we text a lot, we talk on the phone, I've got four siblings.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "So we're all pretty close.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "And do you feel like you haven't been particularly isolated or lonely during this time period?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No I never ever, ever feel lonely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I like being alone, I really enjoy my space.\n",
      "But when I need the company there's always somebody there, family or friends, my husband is very supportive and hands on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That totally makes sense.\n",
      "So it sounds like you have been able to actually be really close with your family during this time and it's not something that normally gets to you anyway to be alone?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you have found a lot of times to do things that you've been meaning to do and to enjoy a little bit, the space to concentrate on yourself?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah I mean I have to say mornings were always so difficult for me, but now I can't wait to get up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I have never been a morning person, I would work into the wee hours and then just, \"Oh gosh, it's eight o'clock, I'll sleep until nine.\"\n",
      "And now I look at the clock and it's five o'clock and I think, \"It's a little too early to start my day.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful, were you working prior to COVID?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No, no I was not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But it's just kind of kept you centered it sounds like, just to be home?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah there's a lot to keep me busy here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I do my own gardening, I clean my own house like I mentioned, I don't want people touching my stuff.\n",
      "I tried having a housekeeper, I was ready to have a nervous breakdown.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like you've taken pleasure in your space?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I do, I really enjoy it, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you ever have trouble making the distinction between hoarding disorder and perhaps an obsessive compulsive disorder, where they're not throwing things away for reasons that are based in kind of more compulsions rather than being hoarding disorder?\n",
      "So, somebody who doesn't throw stuff away because they're worried about losing something that they might need, or they're really fearful of kind of germs and they don't want to touch their stuff to throw it out?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think that in that latter case with the germs, you're able to figure that out pretty quickly.\n",
      "There are some cases that might be a little trickier, and then I think I look for other types of OCD symptom dimensions.\n",
      "So, if one thing is that they're saving all their toe nail clippings because they don't want part of themselves thrown out, and the other things are more traditional OCD contamination intrusive thoughts about whatever, I might wrap it up with the OCD.\n",
      "But if the only thing is possessions, I would be more likely to give it hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you think that someone can have both obsessive compulsive disorder and hoarding as separate things?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, I have seen people who have both, yeah.\n",
      "I'm thinking of one guy in particular, he had contamination concerns and hoarding and it made the hoarding treatment really difficult because everything he needed to throw away he needed to wear gloves and go through an elaborate procedure, but that wasn't the only reason, as you were describing in the previous example, that he wasn't throwing them away.\n",
      "The also was really attached to them and had trouble making decisions about them and wanted to save everything, the OCD just added another layer of complications, but wasn't the only driving factor.\n",
      "Like, \"Oh if you could dispose of this without having any germs, would you throw it all away?\" \"No, no, I wouldn't, I still need all my stuff.\"\n",
      "So, yeah, I've seen people have both.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you feel like it's common for people to have both, or it's pretty unusual?\n",
      "Interviewee: I'd say it's not that common.\n",
      "I think that was one of our kind of misguided early research things, when it was considered part of OCD and people still think that way when you submit papers or talk in clinical settings, that it's all still highly connected OCD, and I think the comorbidity research and my own clinical experience has found that you're much more likely to see a person with hoarding with depression and social anxiety and worry, generalized anxiety disorder, than a person with hoarding who has critical OCD, separate to the hoarding.\n",
      "I think that's born out by the research, but also, we see that might be 1 in 20 or 30 that we see that has hoarding plus OCD, but half of our sample is depressed.\n",
      "Interviewer: And I guess, this again I'm asking you to kind of speculate, but do you feel like they have comorbid depression because perhaps those are genetically related, or do you feel like they have comorbid depression because of the impact that hoarding disorder is having on their life?\n",
      "Interviewee: Definitely more the former, they have underlying environmental genetic vulnerability to emotional disorders.\n",
      "They had a hard life and they have genetic predisposition, and they have all these problems that have led to both, not like they would have been fine but the hoarding made them sad.\n",
      "Interviewer: Exactly, and one of the things that I ask, and I'm gonna ask you later in the interview but I guess I can jump ahead and ask it now since we're talking about this, one of the ways I get at this through the interview is I ask the question: So we talked about all these reasons for saving, to what extent do you think that these reasons are what's driving the behavior, or do you think that perhaps the behavior is what's coming first and the reasons are kind of created post hoc as justifications for an underlying need?\n",
      "So like when somebody is exhibiting this behavior, is it because they have a problem with their thought process where they truly believe that, you know, they're going to screw up the environment or they're gonna need it later, or is it that they're saving it and then when you ask them, \"Why do you saved this?\" they come up with a with a reason that seems to make sense to them why they would save it, but it's really behavioral driven?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, that's a really good question and I think that we need more research to iron out, but the other thing I think about that sometimes is that it can be some central problem that's driving lot's of different things in their lives.\n",
      "So, for example if it's problems with concentration in decision making and attention, yes maybe that does create the hoarding problems and I don't think it's a post hoc explanation really, but could be, but I also think it's something that drives lot's of problems across lots of domains in their lives, it's not just the hoarding.\n",
      "But yeah, that's a really good question.\n",
      "Some of the stuff I was talking about like the chronic fatigue, the conductivity, the clinical medical problems, I don't think they come from the hoarding and I don't think they cause the hoarding, but I think there are certain underlying genetic environmental predispositions that lead to both hoarding and problems with chronic pain, obesity, life stressors, etcetera, like these more generic underlying risk factors.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I'm in Pennsylvania on a little farmette.\n",
      "I have a farm with 1,700 square feet of emptiness.\n",
      "It used to be my ex-husband's shop.\n",
      "I had it totally cleaned, power washed...\n",
      "He was a taxidermist... and painted and the floor taken up.\n",
      "That's where the riding toys, the boats, extra furniture, things like that are.\n",
      "Other people are welcome to store things there as well.\n",
      "It's not climate controlled, but it stays pretty cool in the summer and not too bad in the winter.\n",
      "Underneath that is a stable with stalls for horses and a tack room.\n",
      "That is empty at this point.\n",
      "I have a four-car garage.\n",
      "I have an RV in one, a car in another, a boat in another and riding equipment, lawnmowers and yard equipment in the other.\n",
      "My house is seven bedrooms.\n",
      "We sleep in one bedroom.\n",
      "I have a very nice guest bedroom.\n",
      "It does have a lot of stuff in it, but it's a huge bedroom, so guests are very comfortable there.\n",
      "I have two upstairs bedrooms that were my kids.\n",
      "Those are my gift bedrooms.\n",
      "One is gifts for my friends, and the other one is gifts for my family.\n",
      "One has one single bed.\n",
      "The other has two twin beds.\n",
      "Then I have another bedroom that's like my office, but it does have a double bed in it.\n",
      "It was my daughter's room.\n",
      "I have the files that I'm working on currently spread out all over the floor, but I can pick them up and put them in a laundry basket if I need to.\n",
      "Then I have an enclosed porch, and that's my yard sale room.\n",
      "That's for things that I sell on eBay or a yard sale.\n",
      "Then I have my collector's room.\n",
      "That's where the vintage toys and games that my grandchildren can play with if they want.\n",
      "They like to go shopping in there, see what they want to bring out to play with.\n",
      "Then we have...\n",
      "It's like a sitting room.\n",
      "It used to be the dining room.\n",
      "It's where our desks are and our TV.\n",
      "I have a kitchen and then I have a huge great room that has a dining room table.\n",
      "There's nothing on that and it can seat eight.\n",
      "That stays cleared.\n",
      "I have a pool table in there and on there are things that I'm working on, but I can clear that up if I need to.\n",
      "Then the rest of the room is dedicated to toys that the grandchildren just can come in and immediately play with.\n",
      "It's pretty much lined with Fisher-Price playhouses and barns and schools and things like that.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "So I live in a single family home that has five bedrooms.\n",
      "It's an older home and I say that because it doesn't have a ton of storage automatically.\n",
      "People in the '30s, didn't have a need to collect a lot of stuff.\n",
      "So it's automatically harder there are no like walk-in closet things like that, so that's an issue.\n",
      "It has an unfinished basement where we tend to just store a lot of stuff and like stuff builds up over time.\n",
      "And then, my partner and I ever so often like try to go through and get rid of things in that extremely difficult for me because we're trying to keep things organized.\n",
      "We have trouble finding things that we want because we have so much stuff.\n",
      "And then, we have common areas of the house where we all spend a lot of our waking hours.\n",
      "We have two children who are 16 and 18.\n",
      "We a lot of the time we spend time together in the living room and that's where...\n",
      "And especially right now, I'm working from home.\n",
      "So I have papers, but I always have papers even when I'm not working from home.\n",
      "If it's stuff like mail, things that the kids have given me that I want to read, just stuff that accumulates.\n",
      "And so every so often I like do an intervention because I'll collect the papers behind the couch or next to the couch or on the couch.\n",
      "And every so often I find that it's too much, it's overwhelming.\n",
      "It doesn't look good.\n",
      "And so I like do an intervention and force myself to get rid of things.\n",
      "And then it starts collecting up again.\n",
      "So I do that.\n",
      "I kind of forced that to happen in the common areas.\n",
      "In bedrooms and stuff, I'm actually pretty neat.\n",
      "My car is very, very neat.\n",
      "I'll I keep nothing extra in my car.\n",
      "So it really depends on the area, the area of the home.\n",
      "Coming from a family...\n",
      "My aunt was had a really, really significant hoarding problem.\n",
      "My mother is kind of like my aunt, except she's super organized so she has tons of stuff, but everything has a place.\n",
      "She's kind of fascinating like that.\n",
      "And so my house...\n",
      "I'm not able to be as neat and organized as my mother, but I'm not like my aunt.\n",
      "We have access to all the areas of our house, but it's just sometimes there's just we'll keep our recycling in front of the door and then it's hard to get out.\n",
      "But it's nothing where... I mean, I know how bad things can be and it's not like that.\n",
      "We have use of all the rooms of our house.\n",
      "It's just that sometimes things pile up a bit and get cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "So you-\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I that enough about my house?\n",
      "Do you need [crosstalk 00:26:49]?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "The stairs, the counters, the furniture in the bedroom.\n",
      "Downstairs in my basement, it was totally and completely filled with boxes, empty boxes, and boxes half full of this and half full of that, tons of craft projects, or home projects that were not finished that were just stacked all over.\n",
      "You literally could not walk through the room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you have any parts of your home that you didn't use for the intended purpose?\n",
      "Could you access the refrigerator or the stove in your kitchen?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I could do that.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "One bathroom was totally filled with stuff, so you couldn't use that.\n",
      "The open space in the basement, you couldn't walk through because there were so many piles.\n",
      "There were little paths through it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Sounds fun, doesn't it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's most people's answers.\n",
      "Now you said that you cleaned it out, you said you can walk through every room, right?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I put up a ping-pong table so you can play ping-pong, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I know, yeah.\n",
      "I've had the ping-pong table up for 10 years, but never could put it up because there was no room.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "My husband worked for the Department of Defense, so we moved a lot, every, maybe three or four years overseas.\n",
      "Every move we would just accumulate more and more and more.\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I wouldn't throw things away of my children when they outgrew them.\n",
      "I wasn't going to have any more kids so I don't know why I would keep them, but I would just keep stuff, probably because I was one of seven kids and never really had anything of my own.\n",
      "I think I mentioned that I have four sisters.\n",
      "As soon as you'd stop playing with a doll, someone else would pick it up and take it.\n",
      "That's, I'm sure, part of the reason why I did that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What are your most important things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "For me to feel at home?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Which objects?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "A book, a stereo.\n",
      "We have five stereos in our house.\n",
      "It's a lot, I think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you spend the most time with your stereos and your books?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah, probably.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "How do you determine whether an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Interviewer: So, maybe some degree of ownership of animals helps to kind of mitigate that distress that they experience and also helps--go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewee: We don't have data to necessarily support that, it makes sense but if often puts us into conflict with sometimes the animal advocates say, \"this person did horrible things to animals and they should never be allowed to have any animals again.\"\n",
      "We try to be very realistic, and these are not bad people, these are people who for a wide variety of reasons have done things that have harmed animals and the tactic--and I sent you the paper I think--the approaches that seem to work are either relapse prevention approach, or harm minimization.\n",
      "You know, recognize they're gonna want animals, they need animals as part of their definition of self and our role as interveners is to minimize the harm that can be done, and that means monitoring the situation, helping providing a safety net for them and their animals if they need social services, if they need mental health counseling, if they need financial assistance.\n",
      "What effective hoarding task forces try to do is meet some of those needs while monitoring the situation to focus on relapse prevention.\n",
      "Interviewer: How much do individuals with animal hoarding actually get psychological counseling or get treatment in the courts?\n",
      "Because I know they are very resistant to the idea that they have a problem, and then they go through the court system and they're very defensive and resistant to the idea that they have a problem, and they don't want their animals taken away.\n",
      "Is there a kind of, are there animal hoarders who have treatment?\n",
      "Or have you seen them in treatment?\n",
      "Interviewee: A few, and it's still rare that you get compliance and part of the problem too is that if the situation is really quite severe, so they've been unable to provide for the animal's medical needs and spay/neuter needs and proper diet and so on, often they're on public assistance or medicare or whatever and often there are limits to what public systems will provide in terms of psychological assessment, maybe 8-12 visits, well that's not enough.\n",
      "[laughs] You know, life-long monitoring probably, so in my experience, the only...I've had a few cases where wealthier clients who have the resources have basically agreed to monitoring, counseling, participation at the condition of avoiding any kind of jail time or whatever.\n",
      "And they've often been among the less severely debilitated-type cases, but also they have the resources.\n",
      "Like I have one woman who had 109 Lhasa Apso dogs and they were seized.\n",
      "She got them back when she was able to actually build a facility for them that was nicer than the local animal shelter and hire caretakers.\n",
      "She still is a hoarder psychologically, she still depends on these animals as part of her definition of self, but it's not an animal hoarding case and she's not engaged in any kind of criminal behavior, but she's not cured.\n",
      "025\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Now we could switch gears to the second half of the interview, which will be more of a traditional question and answer style.\n",
      "Do you want to add anything to these lists before we move on?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Talking about your behavior, can you please describe your hoarding or problems with clutter?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well, like I said before, my closets are filled.\n",
      "I mean we have a four bedroom house and there's two of us that live here, so the closets in all the bedrooms are filled, with a lot of my stuff.\n",
      "Then our garage is pretty packed.\n",
      "We don't park in our garage because we have so much stuff.\n",
      "There's stuff in the attic.\n",
      "I don't think the main part of the house is technically cluttered, but we have plenty of furniture and stuff.\n",
      "We don't have a lot of extra space for extra furniture.\n",
      "It's more filled up than it is empty.\n",
      "Then the bathroom cabinets and all of that, same, they're filled up with stuff.\n",
      "We have three bathrooms.\n",
      "Then I have a tendency to have a purse that's kind of a clutter catch all.\n",
      "We have drawers that are that way.\n",
      "My husband is not that way, so he kind of helps balance me.\n",
      "I have certain drawers that are, excuse me, somewhat cluttered.\n",
      "I don't know what else.\n",
      "The insides of my, my clothes where they are in the dresser, in the chest, they're pretty cluttered with the way they're filed away in there.\n",
      "If you saw my closet my husband's side is very neat and orderly and mine is sort of a train wreck, it's all thrown in there.\n",
      "I'm okay with it because I know where my stuff is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like your home is still, you're able to use it as your home space and it's not like the clutter is preventing you from moving around any spaces.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No, no it's not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You seem to keep the items contained to spaces pre-determined for storage, except for you mentioned your bathroom.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, kind of to take that one step further, how would you use this criteria in like an adolescent or a child who's space is being actively managed and controlled by somebody else?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I find that really tricky and, to be fair, I don't actually assess or diagnose many kids with hoarding, but it is something that encouraged me and it has happened more with our Uni students, which is something that I do deal with regularly, is how do you figure out what would happen if the external constraints were removed?\n",
      "And again, that's where I go a bit with the distress criterion, because I think if it's because of the parents being or the roommates being contained to one area, but the person is still struggling on a daily basis with their buying things that they don't need or that they're feeling upset about how much of their personal space has been taken over, or getting into fights.\n",
      "A lot of it is conflict because maybe their mom or dad is saying, \"You need to throw away a couple of these books, you now have 400, and they're crying saying, \"No, I can't\" I think at that point, I would probably say it's a problem, it's a disorder because it's causing so much distress and conflict and yes it isn't causing interference because it's being contained by those external pressures, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a problem and it wouldn't be a really important thing to intervene now.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "My children are totally disgusted.\n",
      "They actually don't give me things anymore.\n",
      "When they were young adults...\n",
      "As far as even young adult, my daughter, she had her PhD, and she was living in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n",
      "She came across people who would throw... just put things in that trash just because they didn't want them instead of finding somebody who did want them or taking them to Goodwill.\n",
      "That was too much trouble.\n",
      "They would just go and put them in the trash.\n",
      "She brought me a VCR player.\n",
      "That was back then when it was only VCRs.\n",
      "My other kids would do the same.\n",
      "They would find something and say, \"Oh, Mom would like this,\" and they would bring it to me, but now that they have spouses, it's a totally different story.\n",
      "Now, my grandchildren...\n",
      "Well, my son is a lawyer for the Coast Guard, so Coast Guard has been a big part of his life.\n",
      "I'm Coast Guard also.\n",
      "When my grandchildren were born, they had little Coast Guard outfits.\n",
      "I got them Coast Guard chairs and Coast Guard books and Coast Guard puzzles and the whole bit.\n",
      "Well, their mom just throws them away.\n",
      "That kind of kills me because those are meaningful things to me and I gave them to the grandkids.\n",
      "When I see my grandkids, when they come and stay with me, I'll say, \"Do you play with this,\" or, \"Have you done a puzzle?\", and they'll say, \"No, Mom threw it away.\"\n",
      "So now I buy two of the item.\n",
      "How bad is that, right?\n",
      "One can go home with them so that their mom throws it away and the other one stays in my house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "It sounds like your children don't feel really great or don't really like that you collect things.\n",
      "Have there ever been any conflicts with people close to you because of this?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "No, I don't see them a lot.\n",
      "It could be because of the hoarding.\n",
      "That is very possible.\n",
      "I've had the discussion.\n",
      "I think my kids understand it, but the spouses definitely don't understand it.\n",
      "If they were able to, they would come in here and throw everything away.\n",
      "Their houses are totally immaculate.\n",
      "One son is a lawyer, lieutenant commander in the Coast Guard.\n",
      "My daughter is head of the archeology department at Coastal Carolina with her PhD. My other son is a pediatric gastroenterologist and hepatologist.\n",
      "They are all very accomplished.\n",
      "They all have extremely great incomes and big houses.\n",
      "The wives buy things, use them or don't use them and then throw them in the trash.\n",
      "That about kills me.\n",
      "The one time I was at my son's house and they were moving, and I said, \"Is there anything that I can do to help out,\" and my daughter in law said, \"Yeah, I have those packed for Goodwill.\n",
      "Do you mind dropping them off at Goodwill?\" Well, you know they didn't go to Goodwill.\n",
      "I took what I could wear and then I gave away the rest of it to other people that could wear them.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, the only way I would describe it is messy.\n",
      "I think people that hoard, including myself, they're very...\n",
      "Their houses are usually very unorganized, like mine is, and that can be frustrating.\n",
      "I have bulletin boards in probably three or four different rooms, the cork bulletin boards, up on the wall, and every one of them is just loaded with pieces of paper for different things.\n",
      "I look at them and I get a little frustrated, because it's like, I don't even know what's on there.\n",
      "Sometimes I'll say, \"Okay, every time I put something new on the bulletin board, I'm going to take two things down.\"\n",
      "That's what I think it looks like, when I look at a bulletin boards and just packed with a bunch of clips and different pieces of paper in there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that there's a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "No, I don't think you can tell.\n",
      "The car of course, if you see them driving a car packed, but other than that...\n",
      "It's sometimes the outside of the house I think.\n",
      "As far as me, I think my house, the outside is not cluttered at all, but down the road there's a house where it's just packed, stuff that is totally worthless, old tractors that are rusted out that haven't ran for 25 years are sitting there.\n",
      "So I think those three things.\n",
      "If I drive by that house, I'd be willing to bet the guy's a hoarder inside the house just because of all the garbage he's got outside the house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know earlier you mentioned that you had read some articles on hoarding disorder, but where else do you get your information, and where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, I like to watch that television show, Hoarders, once in a while, because I'm sometimes amazed at how bad people can get, with rats in the house and can't walk through the rooms, and they have to walk over the stuff, on top of it.\n",
      "That inspires me a little bit when I watch that.\n",
      "I just think how can people allow it to get that bad, and that's sort of...\n",
      "I'm hoping that it inspires me to say, step it up a little bit, cleaning out some stuff, you know?\n",
      "I've started to now, every time I go out or I go to the recycling center, I try to fill up my trunk with stuff that I say, \"Look-it, I'm not going to use this anymore.\"\n",
      "Maybe it's metal.\n",
      "They accept metal at the recycling center, so I'll try to take two or three bigger items that are sitting around in the garage and recycle them.\n",
      "I like watching that Hoarder's program every now and then.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you watch it, do you ever watch whether they bring in an organizer or a therapist?\n",
      "Do you watch that part too?\n",
      "Interviewer: So the same thing with your Lhasa Apso example is, if you have enough money you can get as many dogs as you want.\n",
      "So that for me raises the question of you know, is this a disorder only a disorder when it starts to interfere with the person's life?\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly--well, and that's practically if we get back to my original statement is where this becomes recognized is if it is interfering with your activities of daily living.\n",
      "So, I have a cousin who's got a lot of stuff, but it doesn't quite block his door.\n",
      "Now, if I visit him and I want to sleep on his fold-out couch, he has to spend quite a bit of time taking all the crap off his couch [laughs] so I can sleep, but his bed is clean.\n",
      "Now he's got stacks of magazines around his bed, but he can sleep.\n",
      "So technically he doesn't quite fit, he clearly has hoarder tendencies, but he wouldn't necessarily be on the clinical scales of the photos of stuff, he wouldn't quite qualify.\n",
      "I still think the lady with the 109 well-cared for Lhasa Apsos is a hoarder, but it's not a hoarding case.\n",
      "Interviewer: So then that's the question, is a disorder a thought or is a disorder a behavior?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think...well it's a disorder of thought that often intrudes upon a behavior, although there can be factors that minimize the impact of the behavior or exacerbate the behavior.\n",
      "Getting back to the whole notion of numbers, that's one of the issues I have is we have a couple of hoarding laws, either at the local level or the state level that define--I think originally the Hawaii law basically said that, you know, having more than twenty five animals then you--and of course the hoarding of animals research consortium agrees that you don't define hoarding disorder based on the number of animals.\n",
      "It is based I think on the relationship and on the conditions, but that's one of the complicated things is as a legal criminal issue, as an animal protective issue you might have four poorly cared for animals but you don't recognize their problems.\n",
      "And so at that level, your four animals might be hoarding, you might just not have the resources or the energy to go out and get more animals, and likewise you might have 20 animals and you invest all your time and money and they're well cared-for, and further complications socially--we've had this happen a few times--is you'll have someone like the woman who lives with the 109 Lhasa Apsos and everything's fine, and then she dies and who wants 109 Lhasa Apsos?\n",
      "Then it becomes a problem of the state to deal with.\n",
      "So it becomes a problem, it's not an animal cruelty problem but it still is a problem because it still was a disorder of sorts.\n",
      "But I do see it is an internal disorder that reveals itself in a behavior, which may or may not negatively impact the animals depending on a lot of other conditions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhhm, mhmm.\n",
      "Well I really appreciate your time today so just to wrap up, that was all the questions.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you ever think of a case of an animal hoarder who gained a degree of insight over time, or who came to understand their behavior differently?\n",
      "Interviewee: I've heard of one or two people who have particularly, if they have other complicating factors like other anxiety disorders or depression, I've heard of a few hospitalized hoarders who after some pharmacological interventions briefly seemed to show some insight like, \"Why is it I have so many animals?\" And yet, they relapsed.\n",
      "I had one hoarder who was probably kind of low on the sheet, she had about 20 cats I think at one point so not a real extreme case, but she was also a social worker and while she was in treatment she did seem to have achieved some insight.\n",
      "And actually I learned quite a bit from her because she would describe to me the anxiety she felt days and nights reading websites of petfinder.com and places like that of animals for adoption, and she would describe how she would read about everyone.\n",
      "Or also one of the things we see in hoarders is anxiety over making wrong decisions, and she described to me a station where she actually used to get thrown out of pet food stores because she would spend a long time walking up and down the isles writing down all the ingredients of all the cat food, trying to find what was the best cat food, and when she finally was down to a manageable number of three to four cats but also had a hamster, she described to me her anxiety of trying to find the best exercise wheel to buy for her hamster, couldn't decide and bought 3 different ones and brought them home.\n",
      "So again, that anxiety over making bad decisions that impact their animals, even though they're making incredibly bad decisions when it comes to actual care.\n",
      "Interviewer: So this might be a hard questions or maybe it's something that you've already clearly sorted out for yourself, but where on the spectrum--or I guess to ask this question differently--are there other disorders that you think animal hoarding is closely related to?\n",
      "So, that behavior you described sounds very obsessive compulsive, and I also wonder kind of as part two of this question, what you think the relationship is between animal hoarding and object hoarding?\n",
      "Are they different types of the same thing?\n",
      "Are they different expressions of the same impulse, or are they totally different?\n",
      "Interviewee: They're not totally different, but there are different things--and there is some literature, you know Randy Frost has written some stuff on the distinction between the two.\n",
      "What was the first part of the question?\n",
      "I forgot now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you've dealt with it mainly by stopping yourself from getting new items?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And that's been successful for you but you still just don't feel ready to go through the stuff that you have because it's such a big task.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah, right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Now the important thing to remember is that I could easily get rid of 90% of that stuff and forget about it the next day but it's taking that step to do it that's very difficult for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like you're aware that you wouldn't necessarily miss it once it was gone?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Oh right, yeah.\n",
      "I mean the kids toys in the basement.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Sure, but I also understand that once you look at those things you feel the sentiment that's attached to them, and it becomes hard to just get rid of them even though you know that you're not using them.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Now in the past I have been able to get rid of a lot of their things knowing that they were going to good causes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it helps you to get rid of them when you know that they're going somewhere where they'll be used?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And my husband says, \"Just put everything in boxes and I'll drive them to Goodwill.\"\n",
      "And I'm like, \"Well I don't know if they're really going to be able to use it, and I want to find someone who really needs them.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so you're kind of waiting, or you feel like you would feel better about it if you knew for a fact that it was the right place for those items?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Exactly, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Let's talk about what it's like now, do you feel like it is a problem for you?\n",
      "What is your home like and does it bother you to have these items?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah, there are still pockets of clutter and that bothers me, but I keep thinking down the road I'll just commit half an hour a day and I'll go through with it.\n",
      "Sometimes I've done that, but right now there are other things I'm working on.\n",
      "But the decluttering is on the back burner.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like you have made some attempts in the past to get rid of your clutter but right now it's not your priority?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Had you ever gone to a professional to help you organize or to help you to kind of come to terms with your clutter?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No, I don't like people touching my stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand that, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Or making judgements, I know what I have to do, I just need to take that step.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, can you think of an example of a specific case or cases where you personally had trouble making diagnostic decisions, either whether it was true hoarding or subclinical hoarding, or whether it was hoarding or something else.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, where that's why I kind of like your art example because in reality, I feel like that rarely happens.\n",
      "Almost always, I'd say 99% of the time, I'm pretty clear about whether it's hoarding or not.\n",
      "I guess the only times I do have occasional challenges where it's like, is this hoarding secondary to depression or alcohol or schizophrenia, that sometimes comes up, but not really as much related to the nature of the collection.\n",
      "It's usually pretty clear, it's disorganized, it's disheveled, there might be some things of value in there, but they've gotten overwhelmed.\n",
      "The stuff has taken over, and they're no longer in control.\n",
      "So, I don't usually have trouble based on the stuff that they're hoarding making a decision on.\n",
      "The bigger decisions for me are, \"Okay there's some squalor happening, the person's not getting out of bed, they're not taking care of their functioning, is this hoarding and squalor secondary to just not being able to maintain their activities of daily living?\"\n",
      "Interviewer: So, along those lines kind of how do you make the distinction between a person, or do you find it difficult to distinguish between a person who has a primary diagnosis or hoarding disorder versus a primary diagnosis of depression, which is causing them to not be able to throw stuff out because they're too depressed to get up and do it?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, so my key question with that one is, \"Okay, if I were to come over tomorrow and throw things away to help you clear out your house, how would you feel?\" And a person with depression is usually like, \"That would be great, please do that.\"\n",
      "You know, maybe they would want to point out a few things to save, but they just have such apathy and overwhelmed and so depressed, they can't do it.\n",
      "But a person who is actually hoarding would say, \"No, I don't want to throw any of those things away\" or \"I would really struggle or feel really unsettled if you threw any of these things away\" and then it's clear that there is that core feature of difficulty discarding and attachment.\n",
      "So, it's not apathy that leads to inability to motivate to discard, but actual difficulty discarding.\n",
      "That's for me the way I kind of navigate that one.\n",
      "Interviewer: And what's your opinion as a clinician about that idea?\n",
      "Do you think that that's fair?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it shows great insight, it shows a much higher level of understanding I think of the thought processes of a hoarder than I normally see from clinicians who don't really recognize what's going on.\n",
      "I'd like to get the reference on those four sources because that's something I'd like to make reference to, I can certainly relate to all of them, except indifference.\n",
      "I don't think that in many of the animal cases that they don't care, and of course what we frequently hear in the media is, \"this is someone who cares too much about animals,\" or \"they love animals too much.\"\n",
      "Indifference has never been sited as a factor in animal hoarding for the conditions of it developing, but the others are.\n",
      "You mentioned a lack of the actual perception, again in animal hoarding situations the environmental impact is much greater than in object hoarding because you do have the animals that pee and poop and die and that's obviously one of the overwhelming characteristics of the animal hoarding cases, is the environment and often very dangerous ammonia levels and things like that.\n",
      "So the question often is can't they smell the urine or feces or can't they see dead animals on the kitchen table and that's one of the things that's been very interesting to us, because in some level you could argue that they don't, or they don't appear to, or they don't acknowledge the existence of that sensory information.\n",
      "Interviewer: And I guess with insight there's kind of two problems with insight.\n",
      "One is insight into the actual physical situation and how bad it is, and the other is insight into the way that it could be interfering with one's life and kind of separating those out.\n",
      "Interviewee: That's absolutely right, and usually one of the things we see in probably I think in about 25% of the animal hoarding cases is we do have an impact on others in their care, either dependent adults or children.\n",
      "It's not unusual to have hoarding situations where you'll have let's say an older hoarder in his or her 50s or 70s who's caring for a parent in their 80s or 90s, and sometimes we do see social services getting involved in even charges or in some cases child abuse or neglect or endangerment chargers when there are children in their care.\n",
      "So, not only are we not cognizant of the impact of the hoarding on themselves, but what often brings them into conflict with the legal system is the impact of that on others that are in their care or sharing their space with them.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Literally, we could not walk in our basement, we literally could not.\n",
      "We have more Christmas decorations.\n",
      "We could probably decorate five houses with the Christmas decorations we have, because we lived in non-Interviewer countries when our children were little, and so we had to bring the whole Christmas thing there to them.\n",
      "Anyway, we couldn't even get them all out and we couldn't put them away because all the stuff was in the way.\n",
      "Then that's when we decided we have to do something, plus we really couldn't go anywhere because of the quarantine.\n",
      "It made us stop, drop and roll, stop, drop and sort.\n",
      "I'm sorting.\n",
      "They know my husband's first name at the place where he dropped off the donation to the charity, they do.\n",
      "They run out to the car.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Probably pictures of my children and my granddaughter, things that they either made for me or pictures of them, I think, are probably the most precious.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would happen if you lost those?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Well, I think now with my new attitude, I'd probably be sad, but it wouldn't be devastating, I don't think.\n",
      "I think I'd be just sad, but I could go on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I have some real expensive jewelry, so I think that's probably real precious to me too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This next section is talking about distinguishing hoarding disorder.\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Hoarding disorder is collecting other control, right?\n",
      "I think I have a lot of collections of different things and I display all of them, but the hoarding is the stuff that is basically worthless to me, I think.\n",
      "You keep it because you might need it or that you paid too much for it.\n",
      "That's what I always think of as being hoarding.\n",
      "Collecting is maybe you have different items, but that you can use them or they're on display all at the same time, but hoarding, you don't display.\n",
      "It's a secret behind the door.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's a good way to describe it.\n",
      "No one's ever made that, I guess, definition.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh really?\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I feel like it makes so much sense and it should be so clear, but I've never heard someone put it in that way.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh. Well, thank you.\n",
      "Well, there you go.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok. So another thing we wanted to ask you about, in the literature there’s been a breakdown of insight into different constructs that may be more or less prevalent or might be confused for insight with relation to individuals with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "So we were wondering how prevalent you find these different constructs in your patients?\n",
      "So one of them is defensiveness, another is anosognosia or that lack of ability to perceive that your illness as a problem like we were talking about, overvalued ideation which is the unreasonable belief in the value of your items, and indifference.\n",
      "Do you see any of those more or less commonly?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think we see them all.\n",
      "I’m not sure about the indifference, I would maybe argue that sometimes people with hoarding give the impression of indifference, but they’re certainly not indifferent by any stretch.\n",
      "But I’m not sure if we would treat it differently.\n",
      "We might have to work more slowly with, you know, those people that have poorer insight or more overvalued ideations than others, but I think the treatment model itself would stay the same.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "And you see the other three about equally in the population that you work with?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes, yes, I think so.\n",
      "I’m trying to think.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "So, for the next section of the interview, we’re just going to ask you to talk through some of the explanations that patients with hoarding disorder might have for their behavior.\n",
      "I know we had generated a list at the beginning of the interview, but just to get you thinking about them again, wed like to ask you to think through some of the questions from the adapted version of the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale.\n",
      "And to think about how, in your experience, your patients would respond to the question.\n",
      "Uhm so for the first question, how do you think your patients would respond to “What do you think has caused you to have these behaviors, and do these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?”\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "Uh, gosh I think that again, there’s that range, in terms of why they think they have hoarding.\n",
      "Uhm a lot of them will argue that they were taught to be frugal, mom taught them to never throw anything away, that kind of thing.\n",
      "A lot of them have a big investment in that whole creative thing, so they’ll say that they keep things because one day their going to write a biography about themselves and they need all these things to remind them of the time they went to the movie theatre with a friend 10 years ago or something like that; so, there’s that creative aspect.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, that makes sense.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "The next section is kind of talking about the disorder itself, and so what do you think the most important differences between what's considered normal saving behaviors, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "The difference between normal behavior and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, like normal saving behavior, like a collector, and then hoarding.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, I think one of the main differences is the satisfaction, like I say, that I get from buying something.\n",
      "I don't quite understand this, but you do get... I get some satisfaction and sometimes from just purchasing something.\n",
      "To give you an example, last week I was playing around on the computer.\n",
      "I saw on YouTube a picture of a drone.\n",
      "I already have two or three drones.\n",
      "Some of them are still unopened.\n",
      "This guy was describing one, and he was showing it and how easy it is to fly, and their price wasn't real expensive.\n",
      "I think it was only $100, and it's like I just said, \"What the heck?\n",
      "I'm going to order it.\"\n",
      "So I went ahead and ordered it.\n",
      "It hasn't come yet, but it's like... and it gave me a good feeling, so I think that feeling is the difference.\n",
      "I collect coins, but I don't get that... I get a feeling, but the coins, there's a potential there that maybe you'll get something that has a lot of value.\n",
      "With a drone I enjoy purchasing it, but I know it's never going to have a lot of value.\n",
      "The coins, even though I do enjoy them, it's sort of different because the potential is there.\n",
      "You read about a 1909 VDB penny is auctioned off for a million dollars.\n",
      "So there are some coins that are worth a lot of money, and you never know.\n",
      "You might accidentally, somebody might be selling something they don't realize.\n",
      "Especially you see those at auctions.\n",
      "Sometimes someone passes away and they have a collection of old coins, and the wife will just say, \"Hey, I don't know anything about those.\n",
      "I want to just sell them all off.\"\n",
      "So that has potential.\n",
      "I think that's the difference between a collector and a hoarder.\n",
      "A hoarder does it because he gets that really good instant [inaudible 00:47:06] from just buying something, where the collector does it because there's a potential there and a little bit of an excitement as you go through the coins, of hoping that you'll discover something that has a lot of value to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "They kind of have, like collectors are kind of more specific and on one thing.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Oh, sure.\n",
      "I think collectors, they take the time.\n",
      "I just play around with it.\n",
      "It's a hobby.\n",
      "But it's kind of interesting to see some of these things and learn...\n",
      "Like, Kennedy half dollars, 1964 Kennedy half dollars, are about 70% silver, and people hoard those because they at one point they were melting them down because the silver was worth more than the half dollar.\n",
      "So for a while I was going to the bank and ordering 500 Kennedy half dollars in rolls, hoping that I would get 1964 half dollars.\n",
      "Not that I'm going to melt them down, but they are valuable because everybody that's into coin collecting knows about them, and you can sell them online for probably 20 bucks a piece.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What does hoarding disorder look like, and how is it different or the same from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "The neighbors, no, because I generally don't...\n",
      "Out in the country, I meet with the neighbors outside.\n",
      "It's not like I invite them into the house very often.\n",
      "It's just not something I do.\n",
      "It's partly because... I don't think my house is a mess, but it's not like a standard house where everything is neat and in its place.\n",
      "It's like, I put stuff down, it pretty much stays there until I need it again, wherever it is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change your behavior?\n",
      "Have you sought professional help other than the one time you moved?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "No, not professional.\n",
      "No. I've done a little reading online.\n",
      "I've watched that hoarding television show, and I'm amazed at some of the things people do there, and that sort of inspires me because I'm aware of how bad things can get.\n",
      "However, I don't feel I would ever get that bad because I just, to me, some of those things...\n",
      "Living in a house that you can't walk through is a little ridiculous.\n",
      "I have bedrooms that are a little bit difficult to get around.\n",
      "I got to wiggle around a couple of items because they're sitting there, but I can get into every room of my house.\n",
      "It's just sometimes it's a little bit tight.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Can you describe your house?\n",
      "Are there rooms that you...\n",
      "You said that you can use every room in your house, right?\n",
      "You can use your kitchen, all the bathrooms, the bedrooms?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Oh, yeah, the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, those are fine.\n",
      "I get around them.\n",
      "I mean, there's a lot of stuff, like I have a little hallway going from the living room to the bedrooms, and there's probably 20 paintings just leaning up against the wall in the hallway.\n",
      "Now, I can still use the hallway.\n",
      "It's just it narrows it a little bit because I don't have anyplace else to put the paintings, so they're all just leaning up against the wall.\n",
      "I have three bedrooms.\n",
      "Two of them are pretty well filled.\n",
      "One of them has four telescopes in there on tripods, so they have a tendency to take up a lot of room with the tripod opened up and the telescope in there.\n",
      "I can get around that room, but when I go in there, I have to work around the telescopes.\n",
      "It's not like I can just zoom across the room.\n",
      "It's like, well, I got to go around the telescopes to get to the window.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are you currently living alone or do you have-\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Yes, I live alone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about the room that you sleep in?\n",
      "Is the bed, does it have stuff on it, or can you-\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No. The bed is clear.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like mainly it's just the floor space that has stuff kind of on it, like paintings and the telescopes.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "It's interesting to see when the therapist tries to determine why they're hoarding, and I try to see if any of that relates to me, because a lot of times they bring up the self-esteem, they bring up childhood experiences, and that seems to be the root for some people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You mentioned earlier that you think that your behavior started in the twenties.\n",
      "After watching that show, do you think there's any reason that you think it started in the twenties... or in your twenties?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, yeah, I think there's a number of reasons.\n",
      "I came from a totally dysfunctional family, and there was a period there that when I left home... I left home at a pretty early age.\n",
      "I spent quite a number of years doing some pretty serious drinking, and I think I was covering things up, and so I can look back in my life, and I could say, well, pretty much from the get-go, it was pretty unfulfilling.\n",
      "My parents got divorced.\n",
      "I got sent away to an all boys school when I was in the ninth grade along with my brother.\n",
      "So I think that my background has quite a bit to do with it, with sort of setting the self-esteem, and once that is set, I think that's sort of what leads to the hoarding.\n",
      "Because I've seen it on the show, where people that build walls by hoarding and they try to increase their self-esteem by hoarding things and think that they're valuable.\n",
      "I don't know if that applies to me, but I just wonder about it sometimes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Thank you for sharing that.\n",
      "The next part is talking about the stress.\n",
      "I think we touched this briefly, but does your behavior upset you a lot, and do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "No, I don't think it gets in the way of my daily life other than the frustrating me when I'm looking for something and can't find it.\n",
      "I've mellowed out over... through the years, because if I can't find something...\n",
      "For instance, I had some chainsaws, and I needed to change the blade on one of them, and I knew I had one, because I remember seeing it, but I couldn't remember where it was, and I knew I had it, and I was frustrated because I didn't want to go out and buy a new one because I knew I had a new one still in the package somewhere.\n",
      "That used to really, really frustrate me, because I would spend hours looking for it and I couldn't find it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I can imagine.\n",
      "This has been very, very different than what we're used to.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What have you been doing to cope with the more depressed mood and the isolation?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well we talk, I talk to my husband and I have my good and bad days.\n",
      "Maybe I sleep more than I should.\n",
      "I read the bible and pray.\n",
      "I mean that's probably the biggest thing that helps me cope.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "I know that God is in control, so I rely on my faith more than anything to get me through the dark days.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Do you feel it's been helping so far?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah it does when I do it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It is hard-\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "It's an escape, so I like to sleep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You've mentioned your faith bringing your comfort.\n",
      "Have the items that you have also helped bring comfort, or is primarily your loved ones, so having your husband around?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "It's probably all of it.\n",
      "It's nice to have, I mean we have everything we need here.\n",
      "We just basically have to buy groceries but everything else, we have what we need.\n",
      "It's not like I'm living in a shack that doesn't have running water or anything.\n",
      "I have everything I need in my house, so that is comforting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "That kind of ties back to, that was something you mentioned in the first place, was whenever you have the items you always know that you have that security, that if you need something it's there, so why would you discard it in that place.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you sought any professional help during this time?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever felt that you needed that?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Say that again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever felt that you needed professional-\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No, nope.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Looking through these questions.\n",
      "Did you feel any sort of this social isolation or loneliness prior to the quarantine?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No, because I could go out and be around people at will.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, which is something hopefully we'll get back to in the next year.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah, without a mask hopefully.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You don't like seeing everyone's eyes?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "We all look like bank robbers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A little bit, yes.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "You can't smile at someone.\n",
      "I mean facial expressions tell you a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, they do.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:57:06] our facial expression.\n",
      "You can't read people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's made interacting, even when you do get the chance, it's just very different and it feels sterile in a way, almost.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah it is, ridiculous.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Have you experienced any conflict during quarantine, like with being home more?\n",
      "Have your items affected your relationship with your husband?\n",
      "So that's why it's an interesting place now.\n",
      "My kitchen, I'm using for eating, of course, and for reading newspapers and doing the mail and those kinds of things.\n",
      "And I have a 42 inch round oak table, which has just enough room on it for me to put a plate.\n",
      "The rest of it is piled up with magazines or books or just stuff.\n",
      "Mail, that kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And if you could wave a magic wand, what would you like your house to look like?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "No, I didn't catch that either because my dog coughed.\n",
      "Say it again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I said, if you could change things with a magic wand and just wave your magic wand, what would your house look like?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "My house would look more spacious and the stuff that I don't use would be gone because why am I keeping it?\n",
      "And I can invite people over for breakfast or lunch or something.\n",
      "And it would just be more tidier and, well, yeah, just be more tidier and clean, spacious looking.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So when you say tidy, you mean like everything in its proper place?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yeah, because I keep a lot of things.\n",
      "I'm standing right now talking to you, I'm leaning on my kitchen counter.\n",
      "Then the wall where the sink is.\n",
      "And on the wall behind me, has all these old notes tucked into the little ledge there.\n",
      "And they're things that either I want to remember or things that I need to do and they just pile up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And so ideally, all of those things would be gone.\n",
      "And you would have a clear counter.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I probably wouldn't be as interesting to myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "So there's a trade off.\n",
      "You would have to trade off some of the things that are interesting, to have the space.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "And as I get older, I have to write notes to myself or I'll forget what I'm doing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So you think that your things maybe help you with your memory sometimes too.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you were going to get rid of things, which are the things that you would definitely keep, like if you were on your priority list of items in your home, what are the things that you are sure under no circumstances would you ever get rid of?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Can you call me back by any chance?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Is the reception still really bad?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "My dog, I think, is eating things?\n",
      "Oh, shit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so would you say... I know you mentioned TV shows, but where else have you heard of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "My aunt, it was a really, really, really bad problem.\n",
      "I mean, she could have been on the shows, she just wasn't.\n",
      "As I said, her house had to be completely torn down when they actually removed her from it.\n",
      "I studied psychology, so I learned about it in my studies as a student and a professional, but also because personally it resonates with me.\n",
      "So I'm just aware of hearing about it when it comes up through.\n",
      "Well, you will hear about it.\n",
      "You will read about people in magazines or newspaper articles, you see it on TV.\n",
      "I know through my family, it's just something that I'm aware like something.\n",
      "I think particularly it's probably more prevalent now because more people...\n",
      "Our culture, just like our old home doesn't have a lot of closet space.\n",
      "Our culture has shifted toward a more materially-focused society.\n",
      "Even for people who aren't hoarders, we focus on stuff and getting stuff.\n",
      "And so I think it's a more common issue now, I would guess than 100 years ago that people who have issues with trauma, or compulsivity, or society, or whatever their issues are that ends up playing out in this realm with issues with hoarding much more than it used to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, for sure.\n",
      "So you also mentioned earlier that looking at someone's car or the fact that they may carry an extra bag with them, those are ways like outside of someone's home that you can tell if they have issues with clutter or hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Are there any other ways that you can tell someone has these problems without being inside their home?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I mean, sometimes by what they say about their issues or their not letting people into their home or just a lack of organization.\n",
      "Weird things like someone who you've mailed them something, and they say, they never got it, they never saw it, they never looked at it, or they're going to look for it, a sort of chaotic, there's something chaotic and unreliable.\n",
      "I think unreliability sometimes and certainly you can be very unreliable and not look through your mail or not stick with an appointment or whatever, or not call people back and not be a hoarder.\n",
      "But I think sometimes it goes along with just a general disorganization.\n",
      "The lack of reliability in sort of some of their other interactions or ways of living.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So it may manifest in their certain behaviors, what comes up in conversation, and maybe if they express some unreliability.\n",
      "Interviewer: And when you’re talking about this kind of inappropriate evaluation that’s apart of hoarding disorder, how does this manifest, in your experience?\n",
      "Is it an inappropriate monetary evaluation, so that they think that things are worth more money than they are?\n",
      "Is it more of an emotional evaluation?\n",
      "Or maybe an aesthetic evaluation?\n",
      "Or does it just depend on the patient?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it very much depends on the patient.\n",
      "I think it can be all of those.\n",
      "It-- I mean some of them will say it’s a monetary thing and most of them are not wealthy people, money is an issue.\n",
      "But when it actually comes down to it, it’s more, I think sometimes money- but mostly its value is in the memories or its potential value, and the value of not being wasteful, of being considered a frugal person or a creative person- it kind of defines them, their stuff.\n",
      "Or the aesthetics of it, like someone with hoarding might look at a rusted-out bottle top- you know the aesthetics of that bottle top kind of calls to them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhm.\n",
      "So it’s not as simple as, you know, clear value that they like the idea that the stuff will be useful to them.\n",
      "They like being able to use things and seeing them as useful.\n",
      "So there can be kind of a range.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, and it being thought of as creative and individual.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Ok, uhm that’s interesting, it makes sense.\n",
      "The next criteria I’d just like to have you talk through in the same way goes “The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use.”\n",
      "So, I’m thinking about this one, how do you kind of go about making that determination of how much stuff is too much?\n",
      "And do you think home size or other people in the home affect the degree to which you might see clutter in the space?\n",
      "And how do you kind of grapple with those issues in making a diagnosis?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, sorry the lines very fuzzy so I’m only catching bits of what you’re saying.\n",
      "Interviewer: I’m sorry.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, that’s okay.\n",
      "I’m fairly familiar with the diagnosis.\n",
      "So, we would do an assessment of a- spending a lot of energy and time in accumulating stuff, like going out and buying stuff, going out and acquiring stuff.\n",
      "Or is their stuff in the house stuff that normally comes in, like it comes into all of our homes, but they can’t get rid of it?\n",
      "So, there’s that assessment.\n",
      "And then there’s the assessment, you know, are there specific areas in their home that they can’t use for their intended purpose?\n",
      "Would they be embarrassed if someone were to come into their home right now?\n",
      "We have them take pictures of their home or we have them go to their home and we do FaceTime, so we can see what their home looks like.\n",
      "Obviously, the younger people or married people, we would talk with their family members, because often their family members are the people that kind of put the brakes on or try to set limits with the amount of stuff that comes in.\n",
      "And then we look at the actual stuff that they’re acquiring; you know, if they’re acquiring stuff like ten boxes of sauce pans on the home shopping channel or are they accumulating more kind of junk-like stuff like receipts and plastic bags and boxes and things.\n",
      "[cross talk]\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "I decided to keep the ones that were the most informative to me in the beginning.\n",
      "Because some of them, you get, and maybe there's only a half a chapter that really pertains to what you want.\n",
      "And I thought, \"I don't need all these books because I don't need all that information anymore.\"\n",
      "And the ones that I kept were the ones that would, if I give any counseling again, those might be the ones that I might go to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you were looking for the ones that were the most potentially useful?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And that probably applies to the kitchen too.\n",
      "Because I had so many knives, forks and spoons.\n",
      "Because I had kept my mother's silver, I kept some of the silver I had, but I was now using stainless steel.\n",
      "And I just thought when I went through those, I thought, \"I can't eat all these.\n",
      "I don't have that many people to use all this in my house.\"\n",
      "So, the things that are most useful, I keep.\n",
      "The rest I can get rid of.\n",
      "Now, if you talk about things out in the garage or back in the third bedroom, those are where all the emotional things are.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so when you go through those things, if you were to clean up those spaces, how would you decide which of those things to keep?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, I remember telling you toward the end of the last week, that when I go through the emotional things, what I do is I may take, let's say there's 10 emotional items.\n",
      "I may take one or two out, think, \"I don't want to keep this.\"\n",
      "And then I just shift the other eight to another place of the same room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you can get rid of some of those things, but not all of them, and you end up just moving around?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think about your home and the items that are in it, what do you think are the most important or valuable items?\n",
      "What is most important to you out of the stuff that you keep in your home?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "If I think of the whole house, of all the things in the house?\n",
      "Well, that's a good question because that's the kind of question I'd asked myself if a fire started.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's one way of thinking about it.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Yeah. I have a couple of, in my living room, I've got a couple of desks in the living room.\n",
      "They both have computers on them, so I can use the living room.\n",
      "I mean, I have a TV set which I can get to easily.\n",
      "I can get to my computers easily, but my house is a little unconventional, like I say.\n",
      "I'm not real good at putting everything where it belongs.\n",
      "If I buy some stuff at an auction...\n",
      "Sometimes you get a little carried away, and if you go to a live auction, I might fill up the back of my truck with a bunch of items, and I'll bring them in the house and unload them, and it's just like, well, I'll just set them down in the living room because that's the easiest place to put them.\n",
      "Then it may take me a few months before I get around, going through this and moving it somewhere else and everything else.\n",
      "I guess the best way to describe my house is unconventional.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, ideally, I really would like to have a home... I see people's homes that are extremely clean and there's no clutter, and it's very well-organized, and I'm envious of that.\n",
      "I always say, \"Man, that must be nice to be able to live like that, because I don't seem to be...\" I don't seem to do that, and I'm not sure why.\n",
      "Sometimes it's hard for me to get rid of stuff, where I'll see stuff, and I'll say, \"I haven't used this thing for five years.\n",
      "Get rid of it,\" and I say, \"Next time I go out, I'm going to donate it.\"\n",
      "Then I pick it up and put it in the car, and I look at it and think, \"Well, maybe I'll do something with it,\" and then I end up putting it back down.\n",
      "For some reason, I struggle with just saying... I think of that rule of thumb, if you've got stuff, some people say if you've got stuff you haven't used it for two years, get rid of it.\n",
      "I would really like to do that but it would be very difficult.\n",
      "For instance, the paintings, the reason I got them is they're might be something valuable there, so I would be...\n",
      "It would bother me to just give them away without researching each one individually and make sure that the signature on it isn't somebody... that's something that has some value to it that I could sell.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you say your most important things are for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "My most important things?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, like, which objects are most important for you to feel like you're at home?\n",
      "Interviewer: And I guess in cases of animal hoarding, I remember you talking about in our last conversation that sometimes people will actually have social networks or people who are kind of supporting them in their behavior, and how does that work with this kind of delusional almost aspect of...does it become a shared delusion?\n",
      "Interviewee: Almost a shared delusion, like we've had--in the case of our rescue hoarders, which are our most common large-scale hoarding situations, so people who at least present themselves or describe themselves as rescuers and sometimes actually formerly have a non-profit status and claim to be a rescue organization, and when they do come in conflict with the law or are charged with animal cruelty, many of the enablers or people who have assisted them will show up at their hearings and their trials and will also have the same level of denial.\n",
      "I've had situations where we will have evidence photographs of emaciated or debilitated animals, particularly in the cats we get very severe upper respiratory infections that sometimes even cause rupturing of eyeballs and things like that, and we will have evidence photos or veterinary reports, and their supporters, enablers, defenders will basically accuse us of doctoring those photos and they basically say it's fake news!\n",
      "[laughs] So, to that extent it becomes a shared delusion.\n",
      "Interviewer: And why do you think that happens?\n",
      "Do you have any knowledge of how that gets built?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well usually these are fellow hoarders.\n",
      "It's interesting that they show up for each other's trials or hearings or whatever, but they don't necessarily present them with aid.\n",
      "They don't say, \"Let me take some of these animals off of their hands, let me help you\" or \"let me get you some resources,\" they are just reinforcing the notion that they're keeping all these animals under whatever condition is an act of rescue or love or whatever.\n",
      "So, they are enablers but they're not helpers, they're not...they're making the situation, either perpetuating it or even exasturbating it.\n",
      "I haven't seen too many cases, although it's there in the literature and I've talked to other people, sometimes the hoarders are actually competing with each other.\n",
      "They're like, you know, literally competing for animals that they find and occasionally even stealing from each other.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it almost appears to be a community in some cases?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, and that's something that's also I think unique to animal hoarders.\n",
      "Part of their delusion is they feel--I guess I would consider it delusional thinking...but they are the only ones that can provide for these animals, they know best.\n",
      "So, there's a level of narcissism and paranoia in there as well.\n",
      "My favorite line from a hoarder when asked why she had these dogs, many of them were in poor condition and she could reduce her population by offering some up for adoption and she was allegedly a rescue group and the best line I've ever heard was, \"I wouldn't give one of my dogs to Jesus Christ if he walked in the door.\"\n",
      "So nobody is good enough, nobody meets their standard of care, they believe they are absolutely the best person.\n",
      "They usually have no respect for veterinarians, they think veterinarians don't know what they're doing, they certainly have no respect for animal rescue groups, so that really pathological narcissism is quite often in some of the animal hoarders as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well it sounds like maybe it's moving in the same direction as object hoarding disorder, maybe like five or ten years ago where it's starting to be moved form this kind of like marginalized, criminalized behavior-oriented, punishment-oriented thinking towards more mental illness treatment-oriented thinking and so perhaps there will be more.\n",
      "Interviewee: As a big difference though in object hoarding, let's say you have really messy hoarding situations, at worst that's usually going to be a civil intervention, if law gets involved it's going to be violations or code violations or so-on, it's not a criminal case; whereas with animal hoarding, if animals are dying that's criminal and that's the big difference.\n",
      "Another major difference between object hoarding and animal hoarding, I can't think off the top of my head of anybody that's been charged criminally for object hoarding alone.\n",
      "And that was one of our other discussions today is what we're also trying to do is resolve some of the animal hoarding problems civilly rather than criminally, or both.\n",
      "So usually, let's say we have an animal hoarding situation, what we try to do is have essentially a seizure hearing where the animals are removed, or most of the animals are removed in a civil proceeding.\n",
      "We're not gonna charge you with animal cruelty, but we are going to essentially try to have you declared let's say an unfit owner, I know Florida law has knocked it on their stature, things like that but we're not filing criminal charges.\n",
      "I've got interesting stuff, I think it was in the paper I sent, the advice from the Texas district attorney's association, they basically recommend responding to hoarding situations by combining civil and criminal prosecutions.\n",
      "Basically, you know, you seize the animals civilly, and then if there are animal deaths or whatever, it's necessary to proceed criminally.\n",
      "And more and more I think what we're gonna try to do is to resolve these as much as possible civilly, and frankly the main motivation for pursuing criminal charges is not incarceration, but to get court-mandated treatment, even though we realize #1 there's no well-identified effective treatment, and #2 there's very low compliance.\n",
      "But also what we try to do is if there are criminal proceedings, you try to get a long period of probation, which then lets you monitor the situation and gives you a little bit of a stick.\n",
      "You know, if you do go beyond your three permitted animals or whatever, it's a violation of your probation and there could otherwise be consequences.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any objects that are most important to you or things that you spend a lot of time with?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah, I would say most important to me would be the things that I inherited from my parents, the objects that were important to them that are important to me.\n",
      "I would say that my mother probably was a hoarder also, except that my dad would throw things out when she didn't know it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any parts of your house that you would consider cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I would say that you would think that my eBay selling room or my Craigslist room is cluttered.\n",
      "Actually, you know what, probably every room is cluttered.\n",
      "For somebody to come in here, I would be surprised...\n",
      "Even my great room that is so huge that has all the toys around it, people would probably say that it's all cluttered, but in my kitchen, we have four counter tops and two are very big.\n",
      "Those stay, and especially the counters around the sink, those stay empty.\n",
      "That's for when people come in or when we come in with groceries or something.\n",
      "We have a place to put stuff before [inaudible 00:39:04] put away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I would say of any room, the kitchen...\n",
      "Although my window sill is cluttered.\n",
      "It's cluttered with cards that people sent me.\n",
      "I have cards up there from birthdays and mother's day and things that people gave me.\n",
      "I look up there while I'm doing the dishes and I remember people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, but you'd say overall that the kitchen is probably your least cluttered room.\n",
      "Is that what I'm...\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "That and Jerry's bathroom, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any parts of your home that you don't use?\n",
      "I know with all the bedrooms, you don't necessarily use them all regularly, but...\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Right, that I don't...\n",
      "Like closets that I don't go into you mean?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure, yeah, any rooms that you might not use or go into or that you just...\n",
      "Yeah, sure, don't go into.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I actually go into every single room almost every single day or at least a couple of times a week.\n",
      "The reason I do that is that I want to make sure that things are still neat and also I might catch something that I might want to sell or do something with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Takes me like 15 minutes just to open the door and look in and close the door.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any parts of your home that you don't use in the way that they're intended?\n",
      "For example, a bathtub that you don't really use for bathing.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well in the cabinets in the bathroom.\n",
      "You know, like under the cabinet.\n",
      "We have cabinets over the toilet.\n",
      "We have a lot of storage.\n",
      "Yeah, for me, I have a bedroom in my house.\n",
      "We just moved a year ago.\n",
      "We moved from a house that's half the size of this house so we thought, \"Oh boy we're going to have all this extra space.\"\n",
      "When we got here it was like, \"Oh my gosh I have all this stuff I don't know what to do with,\" so I have a whole bedroom that I keep the door closed, because it's just piled with stuff that I haven't figured out what I'm going to do with.\n",
      "We've been sort of kicking around the idea of making that bedroom into a closet to hang, because it's a lot of clothes and things like that.\n",
      "Anyway, a lot of that stuff is in there and I keep the door closed because then I don't have to look at it until I go in there.\n",
      "Sort of out of sight, out of mind, for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think that the space, the bedroom, would be filled if you hadn't just moved, or is this part of the moving process for you, just putting everything that wasn't unpacked yet in that space?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well, if I had a place to put it, I mean the reality is I probably need to get rid of some of it, but some of it is stuff I don't want to get rid of.\n",
      "It's not just clothes, there are some family photos and things.\n",
      "My mother passed away last year and over the past five years I've had to bring a bunch of her stuff into my house, so it's a lot of photos and keepsake things that I have from her that I haven't really developed a good system for storing.\n",
      "A lot of that stuff is still in boxes or just in piles.\n",
      "Then I have a lot of clothes that don't fit in the closets too.\n",
      "I had this problem at the other house, just over the years it evolved into that because I have a tendency to buy things, but I don't get rid of stuff when I bring new things in, so that creates clutter overtime if you don't get rid of stuff when you're bringing new stuff in.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has this ever caused any problems with family or friends?\n",
      "Interviewer: So that would kind of imply to me- and correct me if I’m wrong just to talk through it- that hoarding is less about having, you know, perhaps thoughts that are incorrect than having this urge, which then the thoughts kind of cover up or justify.\n",
      "Does that seem right to you?\n",
      "Does that seem like as opposed to them having beliefs that are out of touch with reality, their beliefs are kind of secondary to their urge.\n",
      "And I don’t know, I’m just trying to think through the question with you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Hmm, I’ve never thought of it like this.\n",
      "[cross talk]\n",
      "Interviewer: We’re not holding you to it, just kind of speculate, you know?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "I think that rationale kind of makes sense.\n",
      "That there’s that unquestioning need to have this thing- or not throw it away- because it makes them uncomfortable, and then they come up with a rationale that they can sit with for it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "And do you think that in any sense there are cultural forces that maybe associate value and self-worth with consumption and material possessions that might play a role in this disorder or do you think those are separating ideas?\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean not more than what we’ve talked about, with the cultural-- the identity of being frugal or creative or respectful of other people- you know, when people with hoarding keep things belonging to their deceased mother or their father, that kind of thing.\n",
      "So, there’s those kind of cultural things- those are cultural things that we value but… I don’t know am I answering that question?\n",
      "Is that what you mean?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah you are.\n",
      "The question was about that and also to kind of think about whether people might want to have more things because their value is associated with people who have a lot of things, but that sounds like you’re saying it’s not related in quite that way.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think it’s more about their identity.\n",
      "A lot of the stuff they keep is critical to how they define themselves.\n",
      "I see a lot of hoarders who are very, you know, if they’re working, imagine themselves in a very creative environment like uh a film producer or a screen writer- well we’re in L.A. anyway but-- people who can make quilts out of old ties or people who have worked in the past will save every single memo and dossier and folder that’s associated with their work, because their work defines them as who they were.\n",
      "So I think most of the stuff that they keep, its about defining and validating themselves.\n",
      "I worked with an older gentleman, he used to be a clown in the circus, and everything he kept was all about that.\n",
      "It was all about toys, you know, broken down toys from children because his job was to make children happy.\n",
      "It was all the clown suits, ticket stubs to the circus, it was everything that defined who he was, and I think that’s true of most people with hoarding; they keep stuff that validates them as a person.\n",
      "Interviewer: I mean, the odd thing about the clutter criteria, for me, is at least when you think about it sort of abstractly, it's hard to think of another example where we require something totally external to the patient in order to make a diagnosis.\n",
      "In psychology, in psychiatry, in medicine in general, it's weird to think about looking at a person's space as a symptom or as a diagnostic criteria.\n",
      "And if you were to take a parallel example with OCD, it's not as though if someone has like a hand washing obsession, that we ask to see their hands to say like, \"Oh, have you washed your hands enough to qualify as OCD, are you losing skin?\" You know, like the ideation and the belief and the behavior is enough, we don't really look at the consequences of the behavior in that was.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I absolutely get that, but on the other hand, the pragmatic side of me and the side that knows that we're also up against a world that possibly rightfully pushes back against the idea of overpatholagizing everything and making everything into a disorder and a diagnosis, you know, there's all this kind of variation in how much stuff we want or have, and we just need to leave that alone and not be the psychiatrist fascists who get in there and diagnose everyone and create problems where there are none.\n",
      "And we have finite resources, so in a way, I think sometimes the danger of removing things like that where hoarding is kind of, whether we like it or not, a more externally-based disorder, and if we start saying, \"No, no, anyone who's saving lots of emails and they're upset about it\" or \"Anyone who would save a lot fo stuff if they could\" it just might end up really stepping into the overpatholagizing spectrum, and also diverting resources in research.\n",
      "So, I totally get what you're saying and I think it's such an interesting philosophical point; but on the other hand, I feel like it might be an imperfect system, but it's a way to say, \"We're not trying to arbitrate people.\"\n",
      "Like similarly thinking of obesity or other things, we're not trying to regulate how much stuff people have in the world or your relationship with your possessions, we're just trying to identify those cases where it's impacting upon the person's experience in the world and if there is no clutter--I mean that the other extreme then--would you be comfortable if the clutter criteria was removed completely, diagnosing hoarding in someone who said they had these big struggles with making decisions with objects all the time I guess, but that they hadn't saved anything?\n",
      "They just lived in a perfectly clear environment, I think you'd get in a weird situation there.\n",
      "Interviewer: No, I agree with you.\n",
      "I definitely agree, I don't know that there's a--\n",
      "Interviewee: It's such a tricky one.\n",
      "Interview 001\n",
      "Interviewer: So, one thing that I ask clinical experts about object hoarding, which I wonder since you're somebody who knows a lot about both disorders, so when we talk about insight there's a lot of different constructs of insight that we can talk about.\n",
      "Randy Frost had a paper where he broke it down into four, and the four are defensiveness, anosognosia or the lack of ability to perceive your illness or that something is wrong, overvalued ideation; so, persistent and unreasonable belief in the potential value of items for object hoarders or animals, and indifference.\n",
      "And one of the things that I wonder about is is it a delusional disorder, like--\n",
      "Interviewee: It's very interesting you bring that up because I was just this morning at a meeting at the association of prosecuting attorneys working with a judge who I've worked with on a number of hoarding cases, and she just had a case of a client who was charged with animal hoarding, I forget all the details but I believe it was quite a few dogs--more than 30--but he was found not competent based on a delusion.\n",
      "It was argued, and we've never had this before in an animal hoarding case, but because he was in such denial.\n",
      "He otherwise was aware of the proceedings, aware of the charges against him, normally might have been considered competent to participate in his own defense, but because he could not acknowledge that the animals in his care were suffering or were dying, the court considered him to be delusional, that he's otherwise functioning at a very high level but his total failure to recognize the impact of his behavior on the animals was in the court's view indicative of delusional functioning, and basically he was found not competent to stand trial and actually has been admitted to a mental health facility at least temporarily.\n",
      "So, we had a lot of discussion for probably about half an hour with a bunch of prosecutors because this was a first in terms of my dealing with hoarding situations where not only was it recognized as delusional thinking, but so delusional that an otherwise high-functioning person interfered with his ability to assist in his own defense.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Usually it's about how much I spent on it, or if I've had it for really a long time.\n",
      "It survived all these moves and I kept it.\n",
      "I do a little survey of all my rooms in my house to see what I've had the longest in the room with all the objects.\n",
      "Does that makes sense?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You value them mostly on money, monetary value and how much time you spent with them?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Yeah, mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is trash for you?\n",
      "What do you discard?\n",
      "When do you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "... And there lies the problem, right there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Where it's become worn to the point where I don't need it anymore, clothing that's out of style or doesn't fit anymore.\n",
      "I've been able to get rid of that, but that's only really recently that I've been able to do that.\n",
      "Furniture and stuff that we're not using.\n",
      "I can get rid of.\n",
      "I've had chairs that I've had for 30 years or more, but I still use them so I haven't gotten rid of them.\n",
      "It has to become so worn out that I don't want it anymore or it's so out of style, as far as clothing goes, that I don't want it anymore.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you were cleaning out during quarantine and stuff, you just mostly got rid of things that were just falling apart, basically?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No, no, no, no. I got rid of a lot of stuff.\n",
      "I just looked at stuff and thought, \"Well, this is something that I haven't use and we don't need.\n",
      "I can give it away,\" typewriters and stuff that there's nothing wrong with it, it's just that I don't need it.\n",
      "I use a computer and I don't need a typewriter anymore.\n",
      "I try to think about stuff that maybe somebody else would be able to use, so I could give it away.\n",
      "Does that makes sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I try make that like household goods; I don't need three irons.\n",
      "I don't need two blenders.\n",
      "I don't need a bread machine.\n",
      "I don't need all these extra things that I never use.\n",
      "I was able to give up a lot of that kind of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "But this really was just this big, huge revelation that I just had since the quarantine, because before that I was, \"No, it's mine.\n",
      "I'm keeping it.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What brought you to that epiphany?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yeah. I think sometimes people, it can go along with like binge eating disorder as well as a way to sort of...\n",
      "If you think about hoarding is like amassing all these things as sort of a protection from other people.\n",
      "And I think definitely people use food as well sometimes to sort of build in a barrier to relationships and to sort of dealing with feelings as well.\n",
      "So I think sometimes it goes along with eating disorders.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And then you also mentioned prior that for you sometimes quality of life issues arise because of your behaviors.\n",
      "Would you say that your difficulties with clutter upset you and can you describe a time where these difficulties have gotten in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It upsets me when I see areas of my house that have become sort of overwhelmed by my clutter, that upsets me or when I just see my house, even the areas that are organized but there's more stuff than I want.\n",
      "I know that if I could more easily get rid of things that I have, that my home wouldn't look as cluttered.\n",
      "So I definitely feel that on a regular basis, whether it's daily or just like weekly, it comes up when I see my physical environment, my home.\n",
      "Other times that it has caused me distress, I think when I wanted to be able to be the kind of person who just says to people, \"Come on over any time.\"\n",
      "I do not feel like I could do that.\n",
      "Or if my kids...\n",
      "My kids don't always have friends over and they do sometimes, but I want advanced notice.\n",
      "And that part of it is just, I have a strong sense of privacy but also part of it is wanting to be able to kind of tidy up.\n",
      "And then conflict with my partner over just too much stuff that we both feel it sort of create anxiety, our home isn't as soothing as we want it to be and knowing that some of that responsibility I bear for not more being able to just get rid of things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I can imagine that, that must be hard.\n",
      "Can you just you describe a specific time, maybe a certain situation where your difficulties with clutter got in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "If not, that's totally fine.\n",
      "What you described was great, but I'm just wondering if there's a certain situation that you can recall where your difficulties with clutter got on away of something that you wanted.\n",
      "Interview 003\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok. Well I appreciate you doing that with us.\n",
      "That’s just the listing part, and now I’d like to transition us into the interview, which will be more conversational.\n",
      "And just to kind of get us started in talking about your experiences and your knowledge of this topic, uhm if you wouldn’t mind just giving us a brief background related to how you became involved with hoarding disorder and what your professional interactions with hoarders are.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok.\n",
      "uh, let me see- so I work in the UNIVERSITY [00:16:01] OCD intensive treatment program.\n",
      "So, we encounter hoarders in that program, and in the early days when we were looking at our outcome data, we noticed that hoarders, which were usually lumped into the- under the heading of OCD, hoarders were really making our data look bad; so we decided to look at hoarders separately.\n",
      "And so, then we started getting into more research on hoarders, trying to look at them and see what was different about hoarders and why they didn’t respond as well to the typical treatment for OCD.\n",
      "Uhm, so I started doing that.\n",
      "And also started getting into some of the brain imaging studies with NAME [00:16:53], who’s now in San Diego.\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And what is your educational background?\n",
      "How did you come to work at the center?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh, so I’m a nurse and a marriage and family therapist.\n",
      "And back in the day I was a research associate as well.\n",
      "I’m no longer a research associate.\n",
      "Now my work is-\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Do you see patients clinically?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, now my work with hoarders is mostly clinical, not research based.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: And how long has it been that you’ve worked with these patients specifically?\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh my gosh, probably since the early 90’s.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok, well thank you.\n",
      "Uh, Interviewer 2 do you want to take the next question?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, so uh the next question that we want to ask you is if you can talk to us about what the most important differences are between normal saving behavior, like collecting perhaps, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think people who save things as a collection are usually able to take care of their collection.\n",
      "So they organize it in a very methodical way that preserves that collection.\n",
      "But people with hoarding, well first of all, collect anything and everything, but they can’t organize it, they can’t-- if they collect stamps, their stamps would be just kind of thrown willy-nilly all throughout the house in no particular order.\n",
      "Uhm people who collect tend to be able to organize things and keep them in a space that preserves them, whereas people with hoarding would not be able to do that.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Ok. And can you talk to us a little bit about the demographics of the typical hoarding patients that you would see?\n",
      "What do they look like?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, gosh.\n",
      "I think most of the patients that we see, slightly more women than men, usually are older demographic- but not always; so older would be late 40’s and up.\n",
      "But we do see a few younger people who, you know, just left college and hoarding is a problem, but it doesn’t manifest so much in excessive stuff, it manifests more in severe executive functioning stuff, with a little bit of emphasis on stuff.\n",
      "I don’t know, is that too broad?\n",
      "Uh what else?\n",
      "Interviewer 2: No not at all-\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh, usually not married.\n",
      "Usually single, typically, but not always.\n",
      "021\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. As you know, the study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question will be, what term would you prefer when you're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "What term?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "It doesn't really matter to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So hoarding disorder is fine with you?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Yeah, that's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then before we actually begin the interview, we just had some demographic questions if you could answer for us, please.\n",
      "What is your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "My sex?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are you Latino or Hispanic?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Then what is your highest degree or level of school that you've completed?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "I have an associate's degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is your household income?\n",
      "We have ranges so you can pick from 10,000 to 20,000, 20,000 to 35-, it can be a range.\n",
      "It doesn't have to be exact.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "I would say it varies a little bit, but I would say about, between 50- and 70,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then what geographic region best describes where you live in the US, Northeast, Midwest, South or West?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Northeast.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That kind of completes the free listing section.\n",
      "This next section is more conversation style, and it's broken up into different kind of subsections.\n",
      "The first one is talking about behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "So if you can please describe your hoarding problem and how long it's been going on.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "I was just recently thinking about that.\n",
      "I think it started in probably my late twenties, so it's been going on for a while.\n",
      "There was a point where I one time was moving, and I had a lot of stuff in my house, and I just hired an auctioneer to pretty much come in and sell as much of... just about everything in the house, to auction it off.\n",
      "I sort of stayed out of it.\n",
      "So I got rid of a lot of the stuff that way.\n",
      "But then I started when I moved, I started buying more things.\n",
      "For me, I don't know, maybe...\n",
      "I've been told I'm cheap, but I get some satisfaction if I get stuff for a good deal.\n",
      "Like, all my furniture in my house I've pretty much brought through auctions.\n",
      "My sister recently called me and told me she's looking at a new couch.\n",
      "She wants to spend $600 on it, and I got really frustrated with her.\n",
      "It's like, \"You have a mortgage.\n",
      "You're paying interest on your mortgage.\n",
      "Yet you're going to go out and spend $600 on a couch.\n",
      "You should be putting that towards your mortgage amount and get it down.\"\n",
      "But I don't know.\n",
      "I guess that's just me.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Moving will cause you to discard, and I was in my other house for what, 23 years, or 24 years, so I had a lot of opportunity to accumulate a lot of stuff, so moving into this house, like I said I got rid of a lot of shoes, and other things.\n",
      "We got rid of a lot of things, but we still have a lot of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Whenever you live somewhere for longer than a few years it collects.\n",
      "Like you said, if you don't actively think about discarding items you continue to accumulate.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yep, yeah.\n",
      "I try to think about that more now when I bring stuff in.\n",
      "It's like, \"Okay what can I get rid of to make space?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When did you start thinking in that manner, and what made you aware of thinking of discarding in addition to getting new items?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "I think when I had to downsize my mother and bring all of her stuff under my roof.\n",
      "I got rid of a bunch of stuff, but then I brought in everything that I wasn't willing to get rid of.\n",
      "Prior to that she had lived in Pennsylvania, and I'm in Texas.\n",
      "Before I moved her down here, a couple of years, I spent a couple weeks, or one week, one summer up at her apartment.\n",
      "I was trying to kind of lay the groundwork for this move, even though I didn't know when it was going to happen.\n",
      "She was very cluttered too with her closets and her clothes and her cabinets and everything.\n",
      "I spent a whole week.\n",
      "Oh she had a garage, one part of her garage was stacked to the ceiling.\n",
      "Our garage you can walk through, and it's not stacked to the ceiling.\n",
      "Anyway, I started, I don't know I Kind of had a burden about that, and so I went up there, spent a week of my vacation up there cleaning out her closets and her cabinets and we hauled off so much stuff.\n",
      "Going through that, and then not long after that we moved her into a smaller space, and then it was just the gradual downsizing of her that started making me think, \"I need to do this for myself so that someone else doesn't have to be burdened by it.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay so it's mainly the thinking of burdening others with it that's ...\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Right, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It really doesn't click until you do it for someone else when you realize, \"Wow someone will probably be doing this one day for me.\"\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How long ago was this?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "That's one of them, yeah.\n",
      "On certain days I'll just get up and say, \"Okay I'm tired of this pile and I'm going to go through it and I'm going to get rid of what I don't need,\" and I'll find a place for the other stuff.\n",
      "I do have days where I go through, a mood change I guess.\n",
      "I'll say, \"Okay I'm going to clean this up because it's driving me nuts.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "I tend to have piles of paper.\n",
      "At work I do more than I do at home, but right now I'm working from home so I have these piles that I need to go through, because some of it can be discarded.\n",
      "It's one of those things, it takes time.\n",
      "It's like, \"Oh my gosh what if I throw something away and then I need it?\" I'll go make sure I don't need it before I throw it away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, which can be hard because you don't necessarily know when you'll need an item.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "That's right, yep.\n",
      "I have a tendency to hang onto it longer thinking either I might need it or I might use it again, and then down the road it's like, \"Okay I haven't used this in 20 years,\" like the water ski, and I'm too old to do it, so it's time to get rid of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "You also mentioned, this hasn't come up as much, you mentioned sentimentality as a reason that you keep items, but most of our conversation has seemed to come back to usefulness, or desire to have choices and variety, especially when it comes to clothing.\n",
      "Do you have any items that are very precious to you for sentimental reasons?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Oh yeah, like the stuff I have from my mother, like photos.\n",
      "That's been a big source of contention for me and my husband, because he doesn't hang onto anything.\n",
      "Basically when he and I got married he just basically had clothes that he, he didn't have furniture or anything because he was just renting a place.\n",
      "He didn't come with anything, but I had a house full of stuff.\n",
      "Then I brought my mom's stuff in.\n",
      "I mean there's just so much in the way of photos and family memory type things that I still, I guess I'll die before I get rid of some of those because they're photos, they're family photos.\n",
      "I mean you don't throw them away.\n",
      "I could have them digitized.\n",
      "I could get them organized, but there's so many of them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, to go through.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Well in her case, she would take things, like maybe she'd rip a piece off of say, a cereal box and put it under the bed.\n",
      "That kind of thing, she didn't have clutter in her house but there were certain things that she felt a compulsion to save and it would often go under her bed.\n",
      "Yeah, we thought that was funny.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So she just had certain items that she couldn't help but saving?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, and they had no meaning at all, but in her mind there was some rhyme or reason to it all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So there were just certain things she had to hang on to.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you think about this disorder, do you think that you could tell somebody had it if you weren't able to look at their stuff?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Just by looking at the person, or knowing the person?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah if you met somebody.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No, I wouldn't.\n",
      "I wouldn't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there people in your life that you know have these sorts of problems or that you suspect have even just problems with clutter?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "My sister does big time actually.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how do you know that she has that problem, have you talked about it with her or is it from seeing her home?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No, when we've talked about it she'd say, \"I'm so busy, I work and have kids, I can't deal with it.\"\n",
      "But she has mountains of paper on her dining room table, and her kitchen table, every surface, in the guest room, stacks on the floor of papers.\n",
      "And I think part of it is that she just chooses not to get to it because she's enjoying other things.\n",
      "There are certain things she saves like these silly flyers that she gets in the mail and things I know and she knows she'll never use, but she still feels a compulsion to look through everything that comes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you see this problem in her from looking at her stuff and being in her home?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And she recognizes it but she just is busy and has other things in her life that she's working on, does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, and also I believe she was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD in college.\n",
      "She actually went to Harvard and she was diagnosed in her senior year when she was having trouble taking her law reports for law school.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you think that that plays into her problem with keeping things?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I'm sorry?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think that the dyslexia plays in to her cluttering problems?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I think so, because even talking to her she pivots on a dime, goes off on tangents and doesn't even finish the sentence, in the middle of a sentence she'll start a new thought.\n",
      "So I think that's a big part of it.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No. I mean we just have the normal type of stress that probably everybody does with something like this.\n",
      "We're just all sick of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sick of it, and finances.\n",
      "It's impacting every avenue of life.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well and you can't even go to a restaurant and it be normal anymore because they've all reduced their menus and some of the restaurants we used to love we don't go to anymore because their food is horrible now, and it's because they're running at a reduced staff and it's reduced capacity.\n",
      "We used to go to Walmart all hours of the night.\n",
      "Now you can't even, you have to plan your trips to Walmart because they close at 8:00 every night.\n",
      "It really is an inconvenience.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah it's impacted everything.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "This brings me to the end of the questions that I have for you.\n",
      "Do you feel that there's anything more you want to discuss, or any questions you have?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No. No I really don't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well I hope I didn't bother you, or talk your ear off.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "No, no that was fine.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:58:48]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I do have a few questions.\n",
      "I'm going to end the recording now.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Oh, I see that I have a lot of it.\n",
      "I think I have it in a manageable extent, but I think wording disorder it's a compulsive behavior.\n",
      "It's an attachment to things that...\n",
      "You can be overly attached to things that have value that things also that don't and inability to differentiate between those things.\n",
      "And yeah, so there's an accumulation of stuff and the specific stuff varies from person to person but it tends to be more than just...\n",
      "It's weird to find someone just towards one thing.\n",
      "It tends to be sort of a theme in their life with different specific areas.\n",
      "But I think it's just a matter for me of extent.\n",
      "I've been able to manage it so that it doesn't take over my home or my life or my relationships.\n",
      "So I do interventions so I don't allow myself to.\n",
      "But it's the attachment to the things, the inability to get rid of things, a prioritization of that over other things that people more often prioritize, like cleanliness, relationship, ease of life.\n",
      "It's a mental health issue.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I think for me, there's both.\n",
      "There's a judgment of it, but there's also an empathy, a connection to it because I know I struggle with it.\n",
      "So I feel sort of a sense of understanding of it, but it overwhelms me.\n",
      "I don't enjoy watching hoarding shows because looking at the houses, I know that I'm not at that place but I could be and I find it very overwhelming.\n",
      "It's very overwhelming and bothersome to me.\n",
      "And I also know that it's so much deeper than just the superficial manifestations so that even when people do have interventions and they get help and they clean it up, it's so much deeper than that.\n",
      "And it's so much harder to actually make the changes that you can sustain because it's dealing with those driving need to accumulate, whether you're trying to cover up from trauma or other whatever the psychological reasons are behind it.\n",
      "It's so much deeper than the stuff.\n",
      "So those shows are just really overwhelming and bothersome to me.\n",
      "And I think probably because I can connect on such a deep level and it's hard for me to address that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So you would say somewhat, you feel kind of a little bit uncomfortable when you hear those words and think of the show because you know that what they're displaying is on a superficial level you know from experiencing from family and other aspects, that there are a lot of other things below that superficial level that kind of manifest that way.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "No, but I think it's important for me to acknowledge that.\n",
      "So it's not something that I want to avoid talking about or acknowledging.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Mhm. That’s interesting.\n",
      "So the very last criteria that I want to talk through with you in this way is one that says “This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and distress associated with discarding them.”\n",
      "And so we were kind of wondering about how you assess the distress associated with discarding?\n",
      "How do you determine how much distress with discarding is normal or abnormal?\n",
      "And is it sometimes a problem for patients who perhaps have low insight into what’s going on with them- that they don’t admit to distress or they don’t think they would be distressed when they throw things away?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think a lot of them- not all of them, but a lot of them- will articulate that they can throw it away or that they don’t really need the stuff, that it annoys them, that they keep it.\n",
      "But the real test always- the actual test- is when you ask them to throw something away.\n",
      "I think that’s the only way you can assess the level of distress; just going by their verbal report is totally unreliable.\n",
      "Because when it comes down to it, no matter what they’ve said, they usually struggle to varying degrees with throwing it away.\n",
      "The only test is to be with them when they’re trying to throw things away.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Ok.\n",
      "That kind of transitions us into the next section of the interview, which is going to be about insight.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: About how- Go ahead Interviewer 2.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, we just kind of want to get into, you know, literature surrounding hoarding disorder describing hoarders as often having low insight; and that might play into some of that conversation we were just having about how they might say they’re not distressed, but when they’re actually in the act of throwing things away or actually really have to think about it, they find that its more distressing than they thought.\n",
      "So, kind of to start this portion of the conversation, we wanted to ask you, how do you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, usually when they can bring themselves into therapy and be aware that their hoarding is a problem, that its affecting their functioning, their ability to get things done, their relationship; when they’re aware they have trouble making decisions and following through on tasks.\n",
      "Uhm, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: I thinks that probably it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I’m always weary of the ones that come in and say that, you know, “it’s not that I have too much stuff, I just need help organizing it.”\n",
      "And then I assess that their insight is probably not quite as good.\n",
      "Or if they come in and say, “I don’t have a problem at all, but my husband brought me in.”\n",
      "Or “the court said I have to be here.”\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "So what would you find that you see in your practice?\n",
      "Do the majority of patients come in with that insight already?\n",
      "Or is that a process that you take patients through?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhm, in the [inaudible 00:42:42] that I work in, most patients come in with some awareness that they have a problem, and they come in with a readiness to work on it, but that’s the nature of the situations that I work in.\n",
      "So we wouldn’t accept someone into the [UNIVERSITY 00:43:00] program unless they were here on their own volition, just because if they were here against their will, they’re not going to be able to do the work that’s required of them.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Mhm. That makes sense.\n",
      "Well I know that we are kind of at the end of the time that we allotted for this interview and I really appreciate your time and I want to be respectful of it.\n",
      "Uhm Interviewer 2 do you want to ask maybe one or two last questions?\n",
      "I know we don’t have much time left.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Yeah, we only have a couple questions left and I think we actually went through a decent number of them in our conversation earlier so in describing the patients that will come into your office for treatment, how long would they say that the hoarding behavior has been going on before you see them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Its usually been decades.\n",
      "Usually they’ve been able to identify it- the majority have been able to identify it- from when they first left home, and some of them even before that.\n",
      "There’s a teensy-weensy group- a very small group of people- that will come in who describe late on-set hoarding where its developed in their fifties or sixties, but that’s a very rare group.\n",
      "Uhm and sometimes we see young people come in and they come in with OCD and with further assessment we realize that they not only have OCD, but they have early stages of hoarding disorder, and the only reason why the hoarding disorder hasn’t gotten out of control is because they still live with their family.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Mhm.\n",
      "Ok. Interviewee: So they’ve become, kind of, newer hoarders.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Ok.\n",
      "And you know, speaking of family, you said family and friends will often play a role in the patient coming in and identifying that something is wrong, or something is going on that needs treatment, and so just curious as to what relatives do you find are most often involved in that process with a patient?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh, in this program its usually extended family, not direct family.\n",
      "So it will be brothers and sisters, daughters and sons, rather than and husbands and wives.\n",
      "Most of the people that we see for hoarding here are actually single or divorced, which is rather telling.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Definitely.\n",
      "Well I think with that, that’s just about everything we wanted to ask you.\n",
      "We want to be really respectful of your time, so we just wanted to thank you so much for talking to us and giving us a lot of those great answers to the questions that we have.\n",
      "We really appreciate it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh, you are very welcome.\n",
      "You guys are doing great work.\n",
      "Interviewer 2: Thank you\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Thank you, and we appreciate your insights.\n",
      "Could I just jump in at the very end and say that one of the things we ask people to do is to think up other people, after having done the interview, that they think we should talk to?\n",
      "So, does anyone come to mind that you think we should definitely make sure we try to speak to for this project?\n",
      "Interviewee: You might have already talked to them because they’re already on the [inaudible 01:02:12], but I would recommend [NAME 01:02:14] and [NAME 01:02:15] at [UNIVERSITY 01:02:17]\n",
      "[cross talk]\n",
      "And obviously [01:02:25], but I’m sure you’ve already talked to [NAME 01:02:25].\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Yeah.\n",
      "Well we appreciate, again your time and thank you so much for the answers.\n",
      "And so were going to continue interviewing clinicians and researchers and then transfer to hoarders and then we’ll follow up at that conclusion to let everyone know what we have found and what we plan to do.\n",
      "So, thank you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok, well good luck!\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Thank you, take care.\n",
      "Interviewee: Bye.\n",
      "Interviewer 1: Bye.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay well so it sounds like growing up your mother also kept a lot of items and didn't make, discarding or keeping things manageable probably wasn't her first priority.\n",
      "When do you think you first started to accumulate items above what other people were?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "It was after college because that's when I got married.\n",
      "I guess because I went to college after high school, and I married a guy that I met in college and we were only married for like four years and we were divorced and I was single for like 23 years before I met my husband, so I lived alone in an apartment and in the house that I had.\n",
      "It was a three bedroom, two bathroom house.\n",
      "I moved from a two bedroom apartment.\n",
      "My apartment was pretty packed and when I moved into the house it was like, \"Oh I have the space now,\" well having extra space, I filled it up little by little over the years.\n",
      "I didn't have anybody living there.\n",
      "It was just me so it didn't matter if I wanted to keep everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative) because you could, it was your space.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I wasn't ever going to get remarried again and then low and behold he came into my world and it was a real wake up call.\n",
      "That was all about the time my mom was, things were failing with her health.\n",
      "I had to make logical decision.\n",
      "When my husband came into my life and we got married he had to have a place to hang his clothes in the closet, and that was a real challenge.\n",
      "To answer your question, I started accumulating things when I was a young adult after I got out of college, after I was divorced the first time and had my own place living alone.\n",
      "I think living alone probably.\n",
      "If I had been married and with someone all the years, I may not have accumulated as much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah it was the fact that you had the space and there was nothing really stopping you at that point from doing it.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah, but now there's someone else in the house and we have other things to spend our money on, that's the other thing.\n",
      "I can't just spend all my money on me.\n",
      "Now I have to spend, we have our money that we spend on other things.\n",
      "I realized after going through that with my mom that, \"You have enough.\n",
      "You don't need to just keep accumulating.\"\n",
      "Now it's a matter of well if I really want it, let me find something I can get rid of.\n",
      "It's kind of a bargaining thing.\n",
      "I'm not saying I'm successful at doing that, every time I buy something, but I do think about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah it's something that's new, well newer, and certainly has been happening for a shorter timeframe than the other thought of just no need to discard when acquiring a new item because there was space and there were different priorities at that point.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I agree with you.\n",
      "I agree that like the pragmatic, these these criteria are very pragmatic and they make sense for those reasons, and I'm not again like I agree that there may not be a better way of doing this.\n",
      "I'm just uneasy, again, because just like with the clutter criteria themselves and the distress criteria, we've come to a place where the disorder is again external to the patient.\n",
      "We're relying on a landlord or a family member to cause the distress, the distress is a product of their disorder.\n",
      "It's kind of like a side effect, you know like, they save stuff as a side effect of having the behavior or the beliefs.\n",
      "Interviewee: So, if you strip that away I mean I think these are all important, interesting questions, I'm just thinking like okay if you strip those things away, everything that is external is no longer.\n",
      "It would be another interesting thought experiment to think what would you have left?\n",
      "Just difficulty discarding?\n",
      "Is that it?\n",
      "That you feel an emotional distress or are upset about throwing things away?\n",
      "And would people feel comfortable with that being a disorder?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, something like rigidity in their beliefs about saving, like lack of ability to moderate.\n",
      "Something along those lines, it would have to be very--because you know, and again, I'm not saying that that would be better, it would definitely be way harder to use, but when you think about like--\n",
      "Interviewee: It's an important conversation, it reminds me a little bit, I guess you would argue this is still central to the person, if you removed all the weight criteria from anorexia and said like there's so many young women and men and people who just constantly obsessively worry about their weight and dieting and whatever, but they're normal weight or slightly overweight.\n",
      "What if we just said, \"Well, weight shouldn't matter, they're still struggling, they're still obsessing every day, they're stills upset about their weight, let's just get rid of that and we don't need them to be 20% underweight.\"\n",
      "I mean, that would just create so many problems, right, in terms of the pragmatic world of the medical system.\n",
      "But, in a way, you could see it.\n",
      "They're still weighing themselves constantly and dieting constantly and thinking about their weight constantly, so I kind of think of that sort of parallel.\n",
      "Like yes, there are probably ways, if you stripped all that away and just looked at people's rigidity about their stuff and whether their thinking had distorted beliefs and whether they had trouble throwing things away, you get some more pure kernel essence that's driving it.\n",
      "But if you think about what's making it a disorder in the world, you have to start putting these pragmatic things on it that acknowledge the fact that we have limited resources, and that we all struggle to some extent with our possessions and say like what in the world says that this is something that we need to intervene?\n",
      "Part of the nature of the diagnostic system is saying, \"When do we need to intervene?\" And if we intervene every time someone has rigid thinking about their stuff, and every time they have trouble making decision, then it's impossible.\n",
      "But if we contrive it to those cases where everyone can see, like the house is overflowing, the person is distraught, that--I guess that's arguing for dimensional system of hoarding too, that you could say, \"The stuff you're talking about, the quirky elements that reside within individuals are really important and they fluctuate on a continuum, but still when it crosses the line for intervention is still different.\n",
      "I don't know, really interesting philosophical point though.\n",
      "I like your idea that how it does rely on all these external things to make the diagnosis.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so as we get into our discussion of the DSM-V a little bit more, I'm wondering if just kind of off the top of your head there are particular elements of the criteria that you kind of have suspected or suspect may be difficult to apply or that different clinicians that might apply differently, perhaps due to clinical judgment.\n",
      "Is there anything that sticks out to you,, like in reflecting on those criteria as--?\n",
      "Interviewee: Honestly, no. I mean, I guess prior to this conversation I thought they seemed reasonably clear and solid and I didn't have any real concerns about being able to apply them.\n",
      "Now that you're raising it, I'm sure I can understand how some things are being interpreted differently.\n",
      "But, before this conversation, I thought it was fairly straightforward, pretty good criteria.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, and I guess like, just to take a step back and clarify, the purpose of this study was never to critique the DSM-V criteria, and it may be that this is the best criteria that there could be, I mean like there may just be--\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh yeah, I wasn't implying that you're critiquing it, I just think it's interesting that people are applying it differently, and that hasn't really occurred to me.\n",
      "I mean, I guess I may be overly optimistic like, \"Oh now we have criteria, we're all applying them\" and it's probably realistic and reasonable to find that no, there are still some discrepancies in how people are considering things.\n",
      "But good to know, I think it's good that you're doing this.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, for this criteria, the difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas, so the clutter criteria, and substantially compromises their intended use.\n",
      "So, how do you make that determination, and I'll follow up that question in a moment but when a patient comes into your office, how do you make that determination?\n",
      "Do you get them to describe their space, do you look at photographs of their space?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, ideally both.\n",
      "Get them to describe their space, get them to provide photographs, and then use the clutter image rating scale to appoint photographs, if they don't have photographs.\n",
      "And then I do those for the functioning thing and I start talking about things that we as humans need to do in our homes, and finding out which of those things are causing problems in which rooms.\n",
      "But sometimes it gets tricky with that, that is one area that now I'm reflecting on, and what can be tricky is people live with other people, and they might describe hoarding that seems quite severe but is localized and we wonder, \"Is that hoarding now and is it crossing the clinical line if all of it is contained to your garage and your second bedroom and your storage space?\" And usually it's much more straight forward if it's crossed into their main living room and they have that clear interference with activities of daily living.\n",
      "But then we can also fall back on the distress, so maybe they have so much stuff in their garage, their second bedroom, and their living room and it's causing conflict and distress and they're really upset and they can't figure out how to get rid of this and they're really attached, but they might still be clinical even though they're able to shower and cook and watch TV and socialize, because of their spouse they've kept certain areas clear.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "If it's broken I'll get rid of it, or if I'm tired of it.\n",
      "Problem is I don't get tired of my stuff like some people do.\n",
      "My husband is the opposite.\n",
      "He's like, \"Oh just throw it away.\n",
      "We're not using it.\n",
      "Let's just throw it away.\"\n",
      "Then a few months later he's like, \"oh I wish I had blah, blah, blah.\"\n",
      "I said, \"Yeah we just threw one away and now you want to go buy one.\"\n",
      "Well to me that's wasteful.\n",
      "If it's something I know that I'll never use, I will get rid of it.\n",
      "If it's something, like I had a water ski in my garage that I had been holding onto for like 20 years and I hadn't used it.\n",
      "Now I'm older and I'm never going to be on water skis again probably, so I finally got rid of the water skis, you know, but it had been out in my garage for 20 years taking up space.\n",
      "I have a wedding dress from my first marriage that I keep, I have intentions of ...\n",
      "See I would rather donate stuff, especially if it's not broken, I would rather donate it than throw it away, because that makes me feel better to know that somebody else is going to benefit from it.\n",
      "I have started donating a lot of my clothes and shoes to a women's shelter.\n",
      "That's how I justify it.\n",
      "It makes me feel better if I can direct it to a charitable need.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Having the ability to donate the item rather than just simply discard it and know it'll end up in a landfill, that makes it easier to give up the item in a way?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Again, I don't like to throw away things that are in good, working condition.\n",
      "I have good clothes that I may just not be able to fit into but they're nice clothes, so rather than throw it away I'd rather somebody else get the benefit of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "It seems to tie back into, you seem to want to, that objects have uses, and so if they have a use why would you discard it?\n",
      "Especially if there's going to be waste that goes into producing a new item of the same exact quality that you purchased anyways.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Whenever you make the decision to start donating, or to discard, how do you end up there in the first place?\n",
      "Is it because maybe you've bought some new clothes and you need to make space for them so you start to think about what things you can get rid of?\n",
      "Interviewer: To me, when it becomes a pragmatic problem, and again, my point in saying this is not to say there is a potential way of doing this better because there may just not be, is less for treatment.\n",
      "For clinicians you're getting the people who want to be treated, you're getting the people whose lives are being impacted, those are the people that you're getting; but for research, in terms of really understanding the disorder, if you're systematically excluding people who are so extreme and delusional that they don't have any distress, or on the other hand people whose spaces are managed by others, like children, you know like you have to I guess be careful at a certain time that these pragmatic criteria are not kind of cutting off sections of the population who just won't reach this point for other reasons.\n",
      "You know, that's where you get into research--\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I mean I think it's a fantastic point.\n",
      "I do wonder if it's a minority of cases, but I do think it's an interesting point.\n",
      "And I don't know if it's that problematic, now that I think about it.\n",
      "I love the question, your question of relying on other people to create the distress, but I don't know if in actuality it does create so much problems, because we are all people who live and function within a world, within other humans and other things around us.\n",
      "And so if our distress is driven by the fact that our behavior is causing problems of conflict in the world around us, whether it's friends, or families, or neighbors, or landlords, or work, employers, anyone, I mean those are all humans but also space-related things, then maybe that's okay.\n",
      "Maybe it's not perfect, but it still suggests that you're putting the person in context.\n",
      "That people don't live like little space people floating around in the world, and if the distress that they experience related to their hoarding is related to the people and organizations around them, that's okay.\n",
      "Maybe it's unrealistic to think that the person's floating in a bubble and just looking at them and their thoughts and beliefs and not how it's playing out in their context.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, that makes total sense.\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, I think the--\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it'd be a really cool debate though; I think it's such an interesting point your raising would be is this really worth considering?\n",
      "And also worth considering the ways in which hoarding is different from other disorders, I think about this all the time.\n",
      "We talk about in Australia, there's this advertisement for a storage company now that says like, \"I'm not a hoarder, I just have attachment issues\" and my PhD student was like, \"You know if this was eating disorders, no one would think it's acceptable to say, \"I'm not anorexic, I'm just on a diet\" or \"I'm not--\" you know, whatever, \"I'm not schizophrenic, I'm just a creative thinker\" no one would think that's acceptable, but with hoarding everyone laughs and this its acceptable and funny.\n",
      "And there's so many things like that where you see that hoarding has a different kind of place in the world than all these other disorders.\n",
      "If the Coast Guard son...\n",
      "We used to have their children a lot.\n",
      "We don't know because of COVID, but he would call and say, \"Can I bring the kids up for a few days?\" They can walk into their playroom and everything is arranged so that they can play right there.\n",
      "Then underneath that, I have two bedrooms.\n",
      "The one is the guest bedroom I was talking about and the other one is a smaller bedroom with a twin bed.\n",
      "That's where my grandchildren stay.\n",
      "There's three of them so they have those two bedrooms and a bath.\n",
      "Then underneath that is another...\n",
      "It's a music room.\n",
      "It's where my son used to play with his band.\n",
      "There's still two drum sets down there and a lot of music sound equipment that I don't know what to do with and I would like to sell, but I don't know what I have.\n",
      "I took it apart to move it, and then I couldn't put it back together.\n",
      "So now we don't have surround sound or anything.\n",
      "There's a couch that can pull out to a double bed down there.\n",
      "Then I can have company stay there too.\n",
      "What we're putting on is a sun room that will come off of the eBay room and the dining room with entrances to both.\n",
      "That will be 20 feet by 14 feet.\n",

      "Then we have another house in Florida.\n",
      "Do you want that one too?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you spend a significant amount of your time there?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Four to five months out of the year.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you have a similar amount of things down there?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I do collect things down there, but what I have down there, I have purchased down there like at flea markets and stuff.\n",
      "I am Mrs. Claus at Hersheypark for 21 years, so I collect Mrs. Clauses.\n",
      "There are a lot of Mrs. Clauses down there and some pictures, but pretty much other than that, it's basically...\n",
      "It's a one bedroom, one bath house on the beach.\n",
      "We have a trailer that sleeps 12 and that's where our guests stay.\n",
      "I do have a lot of stuff there, but it's not where I collect my stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Thinking about your place in Pennsylvania, where you keep most of your stuff, how important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Extremely important.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you have any sense, and I'm coming to the end of the interview I know that I've taken up a lot of your time today.\n",
      "Do you have any sense of what the life course is of animal hoarding?\n",
      "Is it something that the person has been at risk for their whole life even when they're children, or is it something that develops abruptly at a certain age?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it seems to be, the literature seems to be moving in the direction that there are pre-dispositions that often show up in adolescents or even the twenties seem to become perhaps solidified a bit by mid thirties and obviously increases with age, and one of the things we haven't talked about is also as with collecting and object hoarding and so on, there is a spectrum to where you know everybody has some degree of clutter, everybody collects some things or other and everybody sometimes sees uniqueness in some of the stuff they have that other people might not see.\n",
      "So that's part of the perception with some of the other pathologies, that it's not a totally alien thought-process.\n",
      "For a lot of people it is an exaggeration of something that is normally there in a lot of people, but then goes to such an extreme and certainly we see that in dealing a lot with animal professionals.\n",
      "One of the things when I've talked to groups, for example with the characteristic I say one of the characteristics with hoarders is it takes them, their relationships with their animals takes up most of their social interactions, most of their time, and most of their money, and then I'll ask a group of animal control officers, \"How true is that of you?\" And of course all the hands go up, because these are people as a profession that they spend most of their time, most of their money and most of their social interactions dealing with animal issues--but they're not hoarders.\n",
      "Or I'll have people saying, \"Oh gee I've got 10 cats, does that make me a hoarder?\"\n",
      "Interviewer: Well so that's a question because you're not, so with object hoarding as well there is this sense even among clinicians of the best way to know if somebody is a hoarder is to look at how much stuff they have, and it's striking to me that there really aren't other disorders in general where you would diagnose a person by looking at something external to them, how much they've accumulated and you point out the example of the women with the Lhasa Apso where you know, with object hoarding if you have a big enough house you will never fit the criteria for object hoarding, because you have enough space that it's never gonna get in the way of your--\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right,\n",
      "I'll give you another example.\n",
      "I bought a box of old locks and keys, a pretty good sized box, just jam pack full of them.\n",
      "I went online.\n",
      "I did a little research, and there's clubs and there's groups that collect old locks and keys.\n",
      "To me, there's no value to them.\n",
      "I mean, they're a bunch of old keys and old locks, but I know that this club, there's somebody in there.\n",
      "I mean, some locks have a lot more value than others.\n",
      "Some of them are quite valuable if they're old enough and they're the right kind of locks, so I don't really know.\n",
      "I know that those locks have been sitting around here probably for three years.\n",
      "I really think it's trash because I don't know what to do with them unless I can find somebody in one of these groups to buy them.\n",
      "I should get around to taking some pictures of them and try to sell them to one of these groups.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what's stopping you from getting rid of these things?\n",
      "You know that someone out there would buy them, and you know that for you they have no value, so...\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, I mean, you have to sell them online or you have to find somebody interested.\n",
      "That's a little more difficult.\n",
      "You have to take pictures of them.\n",
      "If you really want to sell them, you sort of need to know... research them a little bit so that you can describe them accurately, and you have to sort of learn what do I have here.\n",
      "That's where I lose interest.\n",
      "It's like, okay, one day I'm going to get on online and I'm going to try to find out...\n",
      "There's four or five of them that I think might have more value than others, but I don't know for sure.\n",
      "I'd have to research them to find out, and that takes time, and so I don't put the effort into it, which I really should.\n",
      "Either that or I should get rid of them, but...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that makes sense, so you're kind of just valuing your time more than that object?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I would like and I should, in the summertime I have a tendency to say, \"Okay, well, when winter rolls around, I'll be in the house a lot more.\n",
      "I'm going to do... fix the clocks and I'm going to check out them locks,\" and then it's like, okay, I plan on doing it, but it doesn't always... I don't follow through a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "No, that makes sense.\n",
      "So how do you know when you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah, that's a tough thing because I have so much space to move things that if I... I have a lot of those plastic thingies to put the caramel corn in, so I could throw out half of it and I would probably still have a ton left for the rest of my life to give 100 out a year.\n",
      "I could move those to the storage, the 1,700 square foot shop and put them in those trash bags and seal them up and get them out when I need them and then wash them.\n",
      "Then I would have them.\n",
      "To answer your question, if I have storing something and it gets to the point that it becomes unusable...\n",
      "For instance, I will throw away rusted tins because I wouldn't give that away as a gift.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I throw away newspapers.\n",
      "I throw away magazines that we have read.\n",
      "I tear out the stories that I like.\n",
      "I throw those away.\n",
      "I throw away packaging from food.\n",
      "We have a full trash can and a full recycled can every week of things that we've thrown out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Do you have something in your house that's the most precious thing to you?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yeah, I think it's a writing desk that belonged to my great-grandmother.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why is it so valuable?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Because my great-grandmother had it and then my grandmother had it.\n",
      "Then my mother had it.\n",
      "Then I have it.\n",
      "My daughter would say that's the most precious thing to her too because she's going to inherit that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's been in your family for several generations.\n",
      "If something were to happen and you were to lose it, what would that...\n",
      "What would happen if you were to lose it?\n",
      "How would that feel?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I think of that because if there were a fire and I lost everything...\n",
      "Because my pictures are really important to me too.\n",
      "All around my room, where I'm sitting here, I have photos that are Scotch taped to the wall, to the filing cabinets, to everything all around here.\n",
      "When people come in here, they can't believe it.\n",
      "It looks like a mess, but I look up, and I see a nanny kid.\n",
      "I see my kids when they were little.\n",
      "I see friends.\n",
      "I see pets that passed away.\n",
      "Losing that kind of stuff, the photos and the things that came from my parents.\n",
      "I don't want to lose them and I'm going to do everything in my power not to lose them.\n",
      "However, if there were a fire, I think I would be fine because they would be gone.\n",
      "There would be nothing that I could do about it.\n",
      "If there's a situation that I cannot personally do anything about and nobody else can do anything about it, then I'd say I'm pretty good at just accepting it and finding another way, but who knows?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well my mother, like in 2012, maybe eight years ago when I actually did that, when I went up there and spent a week decluttering her apartment.\n",
      "Then the years the followed we had a sequence of moves that brought her eventually back to Texas.\n",
      "Then she died last year, but she was in a home.\n",
      "It was in stages because like in 2012 she was in a duplex, like a two bedroom two bath duplex, and then she moved into an over 55 retirement community into a two bedroom apartment, which was a little bit smaller, so I had to downsize her then.\n",
      "Then when I moved her back to Texas I moved her into a one bedroom non-assisted over 55 retirement apartment.\n",
      "I had to downsize her just to get her stuff back from Philadelphia to here.\n",
      "It was a process over four or five years.\n",
      "Then ultimately she ended up having to have 24/7 care, so she was in a home, so she didn't have any of her belongings, other than just clothes.\n",
      "That's when I had to sell the furniture and dispose of everything that was hers, other than what I was going to keep and I still have some of that stuff like the pictures and papers and things that I still need to go through.\n",
      "I still have some of my grandmother's stuff that she had in boxes that I need to go through all that.\n",
      "It's just a lot of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It compounds, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm so sorry to hear about your mom.\n",
      "I know that can be very difficult, going through all that.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Yeah she died on 9/11.\n",
      "Last year was a tough year but I didn't have any idea what this year had in store.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I was about to say, I don't think it got much better.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "We haven't had any deaths in the family, so that's good, because we had three deaths in the family last year.\n",
      "This year has been bad on a whole different level.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah different way.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure, so she's just a little scattered in her personality?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah, very much so.\n",
      "But she did graduate from law school and she was a lawyer.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah I mean, intelligent family for sure, she definitely has no problem dealing with being scattered.\n",
      "So have you ever heard about hoarding disorder anywhere or gotten information about it?\n",
      "What's your main source of information about the existence of this?\n",
      "Is it your personal experience with your grandmother?\n",
      "Or have you ever read about it or seen anything about it anywhere?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah, I would say my earliest experience was my grandmother, but over the years I've seen lots of stuff about it in different places.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So I'm going to read you a couple of vignettes here and then we're going to close out the section of the interview where we're going to talk about hoarding disorder and we're going to get back to talking about your life.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And again, this is just to try to understand the way people who have problems with clutter but maybe don't have hoarding disorder understand the disorder and understand what it is and what it isn't.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So I'll read you a little vignette about a person and then you can tell me if you think that this person has hoarding disorder or maybe just has clutter problems or maybe doesn't even have clutter problems, it's up to you.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And we can talk about why they may or may not have the disorder.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the first is, let's imagine John.\n",
      "He has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in and he's worried that he might get rid of a box that he'll need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in the other rooms, his house is not always organized but it's usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally it's difficult for John to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens he is sometimes but rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Does this sound like a person who has hoarding disorder to you?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "And why not?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Because the boxes are contained in one area.\n",
      "And you said that his house is, I think you said it's not always organized but it's not cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So he doesn't have hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Because his house is really not that effected?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, and also he's saving specific items for a reason, I do that too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you think he should try to change his behavior or do you think that he should work on this problem?\n",
      "Interviewer: And I mean, where you really see this, or at least where I've really seen this in my interviews is with anybody who's had contact with animal hoarding.\n",
      "People talk about animal hoarding as being like truly on the delusional spectrum, where they really believe that they're saving these animals that are dying on the floor.\n",
      "Interviewee: Truly horrific, yeah, the things that they don't see, that they really truly believe that they love these animals and that these animals are suffering and that they can't see it is just a horrific combination.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, I guess that is kind of my question.\n",
      "If this distress criteria is a necessary component to the diagnosis of hoarding disorder, but at the same time we're saying that the disorder itself may have a delusional component whereby they truly can't see the things that would be distressing to them, how do we make the diagnosis?\n",
      "Interviewee: What about my weasel strategy of they might not be distressed because of the animal or the items, but they are distressed because people are threatening to take their animals away or people are yelling at them about their clutter.\n",
      "That's like my weasel way around it, I mean I guess that it's not great but it avoids to be stripping away all these criteria, now you don't have to have distress, you don't have to have interference, you don't have to have clutter, and again we end up at the thing where like, does everyone have hoarding?\n",
      "I have too many books or I'm upset about trying to decide what of my daughter's clothes to give away or you know, everyone can relate to some attachment to possessions, and I don't think--we have enough problems justifying it as a disorder that if we strip away too much of being selective about it, we risk even more being considered what I would call a small and trivial disorder where people think, \"It's just that old ladies have too many trinkets.\"\n",
      "So I think in some way, staying a bit conservative is kind of important.\n",
      "But, yeah I do take your point that it should be able to say--that's why I like my weasel strategy, it could say someone has hoarding disorder and distress, like my Easter egg lady.\n",
      "She was very distressed about her hoarding, but not necessarily about the object themselves but about the impact in her life.\n",
      "And you could still say she has low insight, that she thinks all these things are still worth saving and that they themselves are not the problem.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "It's all relative.\n",
      "I think my problem is somewhere between mild and moderate just in terms of...\n",
      "They're definitely quality of life issues I would prefer.\n",
      "It's an issue, my house isn't always as neat as I would like it to be because of clutter.\n",
      "And so hosting can be an issue for us because it becomes stressful.\n",
      "We have to clean up before we can host.\n",
      "If spontaneously drops by, we're not kind of people where the house is in a condition that we feel comfortable with just people spontaneously being at who aren't members of our close family.\n",
      "So there are quality of life issues that come up, but it's not a problem.\n",
      "I have my aunt, no one entered her house for the last 20 years she lived there and it was...\n",
      "Eventually, it had to be torn down because it was so bad.\n",
      "So I can see that I have issues.\n",
      "I can see that I'm also a much more functional person than blood relatives who had worst manifestation of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you would say that although you find that there are potentially quality of life issues, that your difficulties with clutter is somewhat manageable.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I would say at this point.\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And have you ever sought to change your behavior by going to professional or talking to anybody about that?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "You know, I've been in therapy for a very long time but I've had other issues... I don't usually deal with the hoarding tendencies that directly, there are other issues that have been more pressing.\n",
      "I have anxiety, and I've had depression, and at one time had eating disorders.\n",
      "So hose have been more of the primary things that I was addressing, but I have also, I think, talked about the hoarding issues at times.\n",
      "It just hasn't been a focus of the therapy that I have thought.\n",
      "So I certainly had gotten professional help and I think I've talked about it.\n",
      "But again, it's not really the focus because I think it's more manageable and there have been other issues that are more pressing.\n",
      "But it's certainly a part of my personality and my therapist I think have been aware of it at times.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "And when you started seeing your therapist, how did you find this person?\n",
      "Now I'm getting to the point where I just say, \"Hey, if I can't find it just chill out.\n",
      "I'll run across it sooner or later.\"\n",
      "I'll just sort of keep half looking for it.\n",
      "Eventually I'm not going to get upset about it, and I did.\n",
      "I found the chainsaw when I stopped looking and I was looking to do something else, and looked up and there it was behind a picture.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You said it isn't impacting your relationships with your family members.\n",
      "Has it ever impacted a romantic relationship or maybe your work?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "No, it never affected my work.\n",
      "In romantic relationships, no. I mess those all up on my own without the hoarding.\n",
      "I wasn't hoarding that much when I was younger, and that's when most of the romantic...\n",
      "You're 20 years old, that's all you're thinking about, and so you're constantly in relationships, where as you get older, it's not quite as important anymore.\n",
      "So I don't ever remember the hoarding causing a problem or getting in the way of relationships, no. Work, no. I'm retired now.\n",
      "When I was working, I went to work every day, and it wasn't really an issue other than I wouldn't invite workers that I worked with to my house simply because it's unconventional, and I just didn't want to give people that impression.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, but your work area was relatively clean or organized or-\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, my desk used to have a lot of papers on it.\n",
      "I had a boss and I was always amazed because I would go into his office, and his desk had nothing on it.\n",
      "He had a couple of trinkets on his desk and a clock, and I used to think, \"How can he do this,\" where I had a tendency to have a lot of stuff on my desk.\n",
      "But it wasn't that bad.\n",
      "I mean, there were other people I work with that had three times as much stuff on their desk as I did.\n",
      "So I was a little bit of a clutter on my... but not noticeable, not to where people would say, \"Oh, my God, how can you find anything on your desk with all this stuff on it?\" So it wasn't that bad at work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So no one ever commented or said anything?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "No, no one ever commented at work and said, \"Oh, man.\"\n",
      "There were other people that people would.\n",
      "They'd look at it and say, \"How can you find anything in this pile?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "My last thing is that I know you mentioned...\n",
      "Before you said when you moved you had an auctioneer auction everything off.\n",
      "Would it upset you now to do the same thing to kind of get rid of a lot of the stuff?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, when I look around, I've got some cabinets that every shelf in there is full.\n",
      "It's a lot of little items.\n",
      "A lot of it I haven't used for years, and I know it.\n",
      "Just by looking at the cabinet, I don't know everything that's in there because I can't see the stuff in the back, and it's pretty much just packed full.\n",
      "There is clutter in my house, like I say.\n",
      "Like, I have some exercise equipment, and it's sitting here in my living room because that's just really the most convenient place for it.\n",
      "It's a pretty big piece of equipment.\n",
      "I don't have much room to the bedrooms, so I stuck it in the living room.\n",
      "It's like in the middle of the living room.\n",
      "It's like, okay, I don't use it nearly enough so I don't want to get rid of it, but it's kind of strange.\n",
      "If I invite people into my house and they walk in the front door and the first thing they see is a big piece of exercise equipment in the living room, a lot of people would think, \"Well, that's a little odd.\"\n",
      "I just, from looking around I see, I've got a lot of little tables and every one of them has got stuff piled on it.\n",
      "I have a lot of papers that I need to go through.\n",
      "I would say by appearance is what tells me I've got too much stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Thinking back to when you said you had moved and you hired an auctioneer to get rid of everything you had-\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How did you choose which items to keep if you kept anything?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, I basically went through the house and there were a couple of items that I said, \"Absolutely not, I don't want to sell these,\" so I basically put them in a separate room and said, \"That stuff in that room stays,\" and that was it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How did you pick those specific items, though?\n",
      "Were they from past family members or was it based on a monetary value to them?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, and it's stuff that I was using, like my computers, I wasn't going to sell those because I use them.\n",
      "I had an old safe that I thought, well, why would I want to sell that, because I would just have to buy a new one, because I like having a safe in the house.\n",
      "I have some old coins, so it's like, okay, keep them in the safe.\n",
      "So I figured, well, I'm not going to sell that because wherever I go, I want to have that so I'll keep that.\n",
      "It was basically on the usage of stuff.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Just maybe sadness, because it's a reminder to me of my grandmother.\n",
      "It just represents a lot of what she was about.\n",
      "It would just be kind of, I don't know, beyond that.\n",
      "I don't know that it would be life altering, because there were things in my grandmother's house that I wish I had and I didn't get them, and I'm okay without them.\n",
      "It's just neat to have keepsakes to me it is, it's neat to have these little reminders of my grandparents that are gone before me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "In a way, I don't know if this thought has ever occurred to you before, but looking at the item and if it's something that's useful to you, knowing that you kept the item in the family for both sentimental reasons and also it serves a purpose, so everything around you can provide comfort in a way, because you know that it's reducing waste, as well as has meaning.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like whenever you think about discarding items it doesn't cause you any extreme amount of stress or anxiety when thinking about getting rid of items, it's just more it's something that you have to actually think of to do.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "It's hard for me to make that dent, but once I do I always feel free.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's hard for me to actually put stuff in a box, put it in the car and drive somewhere and leave it, but once I do it's very freeing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What makes it difficult to do that in the first place?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "I'm always second guessing.\n",
      "\"Am I going to regret this?\n",
      "Am I going to wish I had it back?\" Or, \"Maybe it's not going to be put to good use.\"\n",
      "That's probably one of my biggest things, I don't know why.\n",
      "So what if somebody else throws it in the trash?\n",
      "I'll never know it.\n",
      "I take comfort in knowing that someone else is going to use something that was useful to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It doesn't link to anything external, like worrying about the environmental repercussions, it's more just knowing that an item that was useful to you still has value.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's interesting.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "It's crazy, I know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's not crazy.\n",
      "I tend to look at my items and I feel very similarly to what you say.\n",
      "I think it's just, I often wonder if I had more time, if I would accumulate more items because sentimental purposes as well as use is often a reason that I keep things.\n",
      "I've had to move almost every year being in the college age.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you think that hoarding disorder or that animal hoarding is going to be brought out or should be brought out as an official sub-type with it's own diagnostic criteria in the DSM?\n",
      "Interviewee: You know, I don't think--it's an interesting question because as a practical measure in how we respond it clearly is different, it requires different resources to address in terms of the underlying psychology, there probably are differences because of the reciprocal nature of the attachment to the animals as opposed to objects, whether or not that is different enough to make it a totally different diagnosis I don't know.\n",
      "The question I get a lot sometimes is if there is going to be a referral of an animal hoarder to a mental health professional, the court might often ask, \"Can you refer me to someone who is a specialist in animal hoarding?\" And the cases are few and far between enough in any one jurisdiction that you don't necessarily get a specialist like that, and usually what I say is we'll find someone who is familiar with dealing with hoarding disorder in general, and if they don't already know some of the other peculiarities associated with animal hoarding, we can certainly give them some of the background resources that will help improve their ability to better understand that, but I don't know that we need to treat it totally differently.\n",
      "Interviewer: And that there aren't that many clinical experts anyway and you wouldn't find somebody who's an expert in the treatment of animal hoarding disorder in any case, this doesn't exist.\n",
      "Interviewee: Exactly, right and Randy Frost doesn't want any more referrals [laughs].\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "It would upset me, but I would like to do it.\n",
      "What I did with the auctioneer was, I left.\n",
      "I went out to the garage and I drank beer, and I didn't put myself in there to see the stuff going.\n",
      "I did see him loading stuff, but I didn't really get in the middle of it and see what the stuff was selling for.\n",
      "I just sort of got myself away from it and said, \"Okay, what happens happens.\"\n",
      "It would be hard to do, but I think I would feel a sense of relief because there are so many things that when I look around the room that I say, \"Oh, man, I've got to do this.\n",
      "I've got to research that.\n",
      "That's been here for about seven years now, and I still haven't researched it.\"\n",
      "You get a little bit of a feeling of being overwhelmed when I look at all the stuff.\n",
      "It's like, when am I going to have time to do all of this?\n",
      "So I think I would feel sort of relief if I did it, but I wouldn't want to stand there...\n",
      "It would be hard to do, but I think I would feel better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you would like to change.\n",
      "It's just kind of overwhelming, and you don't want to necessarily be involved with everything going?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I would like to change, because like I say, I want to relocate, and it'd just be easier to relocate if I don't have stuff to take with me, especially if a lot of it isn't really too valuable.\n",
      "Why should I drag it down south or out west somewhere?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That concludes all of my questions that I have for you.\n",
      "The last thing is that for doing this interview you do get a gift card for $30, and we'd like to know if you would like it in the mail or on and email... or through email.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, are they going to send me a new card, because they had sent me a gift card previously, and I still have it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you already been interviewed by us?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Not by you but there was some study that, this was going back a ways, where they did send me a gift card and they put $20 on it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That was probably either an entirely different study or a different university, so this will be a new gift card.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer: So perhaps the reason we could speculate--and cut me off if you think that this is wrong--but we could speculate that maybe part of the reason that the rate of recidivism tends to be so high with animal hoarding and insight tends to be so low, while it is in object hoarding I think it's uniquely low in animal hoarding, could perhaps be because it requires so much more investment in terms of keeping the animals, so much more investment in the beliefs about the animals and also the animals kind of give back more than objects.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah the animals give back more and in terms of the emotional investment, again I wasn't necessarily trained or all that familiar with self-psychology, I've talked to a number of people that that's their main focus, but I certainly see it as--and when we teach responders in how to deal with animal hoarders, we have to respect the fact that this is the core of their being.\n",
      "This is how they define themselves, they spend all of their time, most of their money, and all of their psychological investment in their own self-worth and their own image of themselves in their perception that they are helping animals, even if it's a delusion that they are helping animals.\n",
      "So that's the thing that makes it so potent, if they have everything invested in this relationship and if you take their animals away from them I think it's worse than going into an object hoarder's home and cleaning it up.\n",
      "That's obviously still going to be disturbing to them, but for a lot of the animals, you take all their animals away and you're almost literally ripping their heart out and that becomes a very hot topic that we still debate among people responding to animal hoarding situations, is it's very common in animal cruelty cases that if there is a conviction or proof of animal cruelty, you issue a no-contact order, you can't have any more animals, and we debated back and forth whether that is necessary in responding to hoarding situations.\n",
      "Do you let them keep some?\n",
      "How many?\n",
      "And so on.\n",
      "As with alcohol treatment, you have those that basically say, \"You can't be a social drinker if you're an alcoholic, you have to go to complete abstinence\" versus those who say \"you can learn to be a social drinker.\"\n",
      "My own view, what I personally recommend and seems to work is for a variety of reasons I like to recommend that convicted animal hoarders be allowed to keep a small number of animals, usually no more than five, probably maybe three for a couple of reasons.\n",
      "Number one, judges don't like taking people's stuff away from them, so they are very sympathetic and I've been lectured by judges for being too mean to sweet old ladies if we take their animals away or any of their animals away.\n",
      "So that makes the court proceed a little easier, it also seems to reduce the stresses of separation anxiety pulling animals away, but also tactically it now gives us reason to require random access to their environment.\n",
      "So, you have to agree as part of your condition to probation to unannounced reasonable home visits to make sure you only have those three dogs.\n",
      "And basically if whoever is monitoring the situation comes back and sees that you now have seven dogs, that's contempt of court, you could go to jail.\n",
      "So, my own practical tactical belief is it is appropriate to allow keeping some stuff, just like you wouldn't send an object hoarder into an empty home.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes. And almost, I would say almost every other day, I say, I've got to get rid of this and I got to go through this and so forth.\n",
      "So it's on my mind a lot.\n",
      "And it has been since it started to pile up, so I'm like...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So it's something that you're actively trying to change.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "But I never quite make it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And have you ever gone to somebody to get help to change your behavior or to change your clutter?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "No. Mm-mm (negative).\n",
      "I've read about it.\n",
      "You know, there's books about how to clean out your clutter.\n",
      "And I have probably two or three of those and I've read through them, but that doesn't do much help.\n",
      "I mean, it tells you what to do and I think, yeah, I know how to do that.\n",
      "It's just that I'm not doing it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What do you think is getting in the way of you being able to organize?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "What do I think is getting in the way?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, I think I've said that, I have too many interests and want to keep things.\n",
      "And then when I start going through things, I don't really get rid of that much stuff.\n",
      "There's a lot of stuff out in the garage.\n",
      "Let's say that came from my mother, that was my mother's.\n",
      "Why do I need to keep it?\n",
      "So it's an emotional thing and I go through that and I think, \"Oh, well, I'll throw some of this away.\"\n",
      "And let's say there's 20 items.\n",
      "I'll throw one away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So when you go through your items, you end up deciding to keep them a lot of the time.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I ended up moving it from one place to another.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Have you ever had, do you have friends or family or anybody else who's involved with your life give you feedback on your cutter clutter problems?\n",
      "Has it ever caused conflict for you?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "No, because the people that...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you live alone now?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "I don't have any children so then there's nobody that close to me.\n",
      "Several of my friends at this point have passed away, but that's not an excuse because they were around for a long time.\n",
      "And some of my relatives, like aunts or cousins are not in my area.\n",
      "They're not near me.\n",
      "And they say, \"Oh, I'll come up and visit you.\"\n",
      "I give them an excuse, why they don't want to come up and visit me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you don't have that many people in your home.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You don't have that many people in your home normally.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So it seems that there are some areas like the couch with the papers, the dining room with also projects, where there are areas of your home that are being utilized but not necessarily utilized for the purpose that they're intended to?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that there are any other areas of the home that are maybe being used as storage and not as they're intended to like the stove or the bathtub or other areas?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "No, no. That's where we kind of draw the line.\n",
      "All the appliances, all the bathrooms, all of those are fine.\n",
      "I will not let it get to that point.\n",
      "As I've said, I had my aunt who had a really, really bad problem and I would never let it get to that point.\n",
      "But I do notice that there are as I said, there are piles of photos in the dining room.\n",
      "That's not ideal.\n",
      "And when we're hosting people, that's not what we ideally want to be in there.\n",
      "But no, there's nothing on the stove or in the showers or, or bathtubs or anything like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I'd like it to just to have less.\n",
      "To have space on a shelf and not things piled up.\n",
      "I'd like to have a lot less stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So ideally-\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "The challenge is, I don't like to get rid of things and my partner really likes to get things.\n",
      "So that combination is a really, really tough combination.\n",
      "Because she loves to get yes things and she'll get rid of things, but she likes to get things and I, once we get things like I'm okay with not accumulating more, I just can't get rid of stuff.\n",
      "So we end up with a lot more influx than output, which is the [problem 00:32:08] So I'd like to have a home that has just clean empty areas.\n",
      "It doesn't have to be totally minimalist, but I'd like it to have like really open surfaces and stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, of course.\n",
      "And how important are your things for you to feel at home and what are the objects that you think are the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "I really didn't save a whole lot of hers, a little bit, but not very much.\n",
      "For my husband, I did most of it and for him, I don't think it was too hard for him either, but we did pack up a whole U-haul trailer full of stuff and brought it from California back here to Colorado.\n",
      "We did save some stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "We got rid of most of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did it ever affect your work?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "My work?\n",
      "No, mm-mm (negative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you have a desk or anything?\n",
      "Was your office or desk clean at work?\n",
      "Was it always organized or was it also really cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Cluttered, cluttered.\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Always cluttered, everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, Did anyone ever comment on it?\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "No, I don't think so.\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'm trying to think if I missed anything.\n",
      "I think that we've covered everything.\n",
      "Participant 022:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Number one, I wouldn't want to pay for it.\n",
      "Number two, even though I do counseling in another field.\n",
      "I never thought about that.\n",
      "I don't know that it would be that much help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "What do you think that would be like?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, I like books.\n",
      "I've talked to this little group of people.\n",
      "I've done things and sure, something has made me burst with energy to start on something, but I never get finished with it, of getting rid of it or sorting it out.\n",
      "And you can't just throw, at least this is coming from me and it's true of most people, I think.\n",
      "You can't just throw things out that are financially worth something.\n",
      "Especially if they're good artwork or something like that.\n",
      "And that takes time and energy to do that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like you don't think that the problem is that you don't have the motivation.\n",
      "The problem is just having the time and energy to do the task of getting through organizing all of it.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, that's only recently.\n",
      "In the past, it isn't.\n",
      "I had lots of energy, because I used to buy things on eBay.\n",
      "Why not sell things on eBay?\n",
      "And I started to sell a few things on eBay, but it just became a pain of taking up the time to find something, to mail it in and take it to the post office and do all that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you feel like the idea of a counselor or somebody like that, wouldn't be helpful to you, because you don't feel like that's the kind of help you need.\n",
      "What you need is to just have the time and energy to focus on doing it.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "At this point.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And the desire, it sounds like it's not your priority.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Even all the way along, I think so.\n",
      "Because I had other things to do that were more interesting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes total sense.\n",
      "Now I'd like you to think kind of more generally about these sorts of problems, either just clutter problems or hoarding disorder.\n",
      "And when you think about it, what do you think is a difference or the line between a normal kind of saving behavior?\n",
      "Maybe somebody who collects things or somebody who just has a lot of stuff, and somebody who has a problem with saving, like a clutter problem or hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, when you say that, I think in my case, it depends on what it is.\n",
      "Because I am a collector because I collected the bottles.\n",
      "Well, my husband and I collected the bottles together.\n",
      "And we used to have them displayed.\n",
      "But then, well, of course I sold some of those off when he passed away.\n",
      "Some of the things of mine are actually collections.\n",
      "When I was younger, I was a lot more active and handy around the house.\n",
      "I would fix things, so my tools were important for me to keep, because even if it's not something I use often, I knew that I might need that tool someday to fix something, so I wouldn't want to get rid of it because I might need it.\n",
      "As I get older, I know that I'm doing less and less.\n",
      "It's a little more difficult to go up on the roof now, so a lot of the tools I'm taking a second look at.\n",
      "Another thing, I bought a motorcycle and I haven't rode it for four, maybe five years now.\n",
      "It's like, okay, I go out in the garage, I start it up once in a while but I'm not riding it.\n",
      "I'm thinking, well, I really need to get rid of it because it's losing any value it has as it gets older, and it's just sitting there.\n",
      "So I've got to clear out...\n",
      "The problem is the garage has got a lot of stuff in it, so it's not like I can just move the bike out real easily to put it up for sale.\n",
      "There's some bigger equipment in there that I really have to move to get the bike out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you basically chose your items based on usage and how often you use them and how important they are to be used, so your tools you use quite a bit and your computers that you use every day.\n",
      "Is that how you chose those items?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Okay, go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. What were you going to say?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "I was going to say, I had some valuable dining room equipment, a dining room table and chairs that was pretty old, and I knew it was valuable just from people seeing it and asking me about it, but to me it didn't have a lot of value because it was a big round dining room table.\n",
      "I live by myself.\n",
      "It's not like I'm having dinner parties with five, six, seven people sitting around a table eating.\n",
      "It's like I really didn't care what it went for because it was not useful for me.\n",
      "024\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The first thing I'd like to ask you is just how you talk about your own problems with clutter.\n",
      "Would you say that you're a person who has problems with clutter?\n",
      "Would you say that you're a person who has problems with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "I would say a big problem with clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you have a clutter problem.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "I have a what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, that's all the lists that I had for you today.\n",
      "Now I'd like to move into the part of the interview where we just talk a little bit more naturally.\n",
      "Just to start.\n",
      "I would love for you to tell me about your clutter problems.\n",
      "When they began and what it's like for you now.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, I don't know when it began.\n",
      "When it began...\n",
      "Oh, I'm thinking back to when I was a child.\n",
      "Of course, my mother would get rid of things.\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Let me think.\n",
      "That I have to think.\n",
      "It probably began when I bought my first house, because then I had space and to keep things.\n",
      "So that would have been, do you want my ages or what do you want?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, you can tell me this story however it makes sense to you.\n",
      "So if you remember how old you were or you can approximate, it's totally fine.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, I'm thinking probably in my mid twenties or, yeah, mid to late twenties.\n",
      "That's when it started because I had more room to keep things and I was out working.\n",
      "So I had my own money to buy things.\n",
      "And then my husband passed, then I was married and my husband passed away and he brought all the stuff that he had, which was good stuff because he always have an antique store.\n",
      "And so I had to put up with that, which filled up my garage.\n",
      "Our garage at that time, but it's a state and then my mother passed away and I got all of her things.\n",
      "So in the meantime I was doing my own collecting of items.\n",
      "So it started back in mid to late twenties and then just kind of gradually grew.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So it sounds like in your mid twenties, was there a little bit?\n",
      "But over time you've kind of accumulated more and more stuff from the various people in your life.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Plus what I was accumulating myself, like books and records and things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "And antiques too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Et cetera, et cetera.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So it sounds like you always had the tendency to keep things because you had so many interests.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so just to get into kind of talking about the diagnostic criteria now, for you, what do you think are the most important differences between the spectrum of normal saving behavior, such as perhaps extreme collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean I always fall back on like the DSM interference and distress, but I think that's probably a little bit of a banal answer or not exactly what you're looking for.\n",
      "What is the main difference?\n",
      "I guess maybe your ability to be realistic about your ability to and your need to keep things, that we all might have a moment where I think, \"Aww, there's 20 million of my children's books, I would love to keep them all,\" but then I'm able to realistically think about how much I'm going to use them and how much space I have in my home and make the decision according to that, versus being driven by my emotions and my anxiety to just keep everything.\n",
      "I don't know how that's gonna be well summarized, but, balancing out your desire to save things with more pragmatic, realistic decision making.\n",
      "I guess there's also the fact of probably not having as many--that would be the other obvious thing is, while I may have those feelings of attachment and wanting to save a few things, people with hoarding have them about a lot of things, so that would be the other major distinction.\n",
      "That we all struggle with certain items, but people with hoarding it's often the vast majority of items that gets them.\n",
      "Interviewer: And do you think it's possible to have a person with hoarding disorder who saves only a particular kind of item?\n",
      "So, a person who has an extensive like cuckoo clock collection that fills their home would still fit the criteria.\n",
      "Interviewee: Cuckoo clocks, that might be harder to fit the criteria because you could possibly be a connoisseur and it sounds less-likely that it could dominate your living space completely, but I have seen people that, for example, primarily collect bikes, but they're old and broken bikes, and they do fill up their homes, their garage, their living space, their bedrooms, and they're not organized, they're not high value, and yes it's one item, but it is a problem.\n",
      "I think it's rare because usually people have more of a mix, but I do think it's possible.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, the kind of indiscriminate nature of the saving is not a firm diagnostic criteria, but it does tend to be less discriminant?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um, I guess I would say, cuz even the bike scenario, that it is still indiscriminate.\n",
      "So, if you have one type of item you're saving but you're discriminant about...selective about those items, that you only are saving nice, valuable, could sell in the market place bikes or cuckoo clocks, that it would be hard to make the case that it was hoarding.\n",
      "However, if it was suddenly any cuckoo-related product or parts of broken down ones, and you just filled your house with ones that were no longer functioning or valuable to anyone but you and it is indiscriminate, even if it is a single type of item.\n",
      "So, I guess you could still use indiscriminate, whether you're indiscriminately saving a range of items or indiscriminately saving one item without properly acknowledging the value and the functioning aspects of those items.\n",
      "Interviewer: One way that I am trying to get at that change over time, and this might seem like a silly way, but it's the only way that I've thought of, is the TV show, \"Hoarders\" has now been on for 10 seasons.\n",
      "So, I'm gonna go through every episode in code for why people say they're saving items and see if it changes over time.\n",
      "Granted, that's a very small sample size, but it's 10 episodes a season and there's two people per episode, so 20 hoarders a year for 10 years, just to see how it shifts.\n",
      "Interviewee: Wow, that is such a great idea.\n",
      "Yeah, I love it.\n",
      "Interviewer: We'll see how it goes.\n",
      "Interviewee: I think people have done interesting stigma stuff, [NAME 1:13:10] I think is doing it, I can't pronounce his last name correctly but showing people's attitudes, this is a different question but, pre- and post- watching the show, \"Hoarders\" and how it affects their feelings of stigma, but I think using that show over time is also really interesting to see reasons for saving, how they've changed.\n",
      "Interviewer: We'll see how it goes.\n",
      "Interviewee: Isn't there a British hoarding show as well as an American one?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, there's like a ton.\n",
      "And part of what I'm coding for as I watch the episodes, and I'd love your input on it because I've kind of...it's still taking shape, I've got a bunch of undergrads who are working on this with me and we're all kind of coding this together, is all kinds of stuff, so like how much social services are talked about, and eviction.\n",
      "When people express their reasons for distress, like why are people distressed in different scenarios?\n",
      "And kind of the purpose behind that is like, imagine you're a person with this disorder, who's watching the show and identifying with the distress.\n",
      "How much are you being told like, \"If I go out and get treatment, what will happen is social services.\"\n",
      "You know, how is how is treatment described in the show?\n",
      "What are the long term impacts of hoarding disorder as described by the show?\n",
      "To kind of see what message it's sending and how that plays into this problem of seeking treatment and being retained in treatment.\n",
      "But anyway, we'll see what happens.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I love it.\n",
      "Who are you working with, sorry I've lost track from our long ago scheduling e-mails.\n",
      "Where are you?\n",
      "Interviewer: I'm at the University of Florida.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. And also kind of along those lines, so for healthy individuals there’s kind of a degree in variance in the free space that they like in their home.\n",
      "So for example, some people might prefer to have a clear desk, while other people like to have things out and ready to go and don’t mind it being that cluttered.\n",
      "Do you think that there’s perhaps a way that hoarding disorder is related to this or could be an extension of this variance that surpasses the officially acceptable threshold?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think when it moves from being functional to non-functional.\n",
      "So some people like a more cluttered desk with everything to hand, but when that desk is so cluttered that they can’t find the things that they need to find and the things that they need to do at the desk, then it’s starting to kind of tip over onto a more non-functional or pathologic issue.\n",
      "Interviewer: Mhm, mhm.\n",
      "And do you find with your patients that they kind of enjoy their cluttered spaces?\n",
      "That they like the sense of being surrounded by objects, like kind of feeling that closed in, cave-like environment?\n",
      "Or do you find like that’s not really a part of it, that it’s just as a byproduct of the saving?\n",
      "Interviewee: Right.\n",
      "I don’t know if it’s like is the right word- comfortable and safe.\n",
      "Uhm, yes.\n",
      "I would agree that clutter and that kind of closed-in, what we would call claustrophobic feeling, makes them feel safe and secure; and when it starts to be cleared out, they definitely go through a very difficult period of getting used to that openness and it makes them feel extremely vulnerable.\n",
      "And sometimes they might say they like the cluttered space, but I think its more they like the safe feeling, because when they are in another environment, either in someone else’s home or if they’re in a hotel room or something like that, they always say that they really love the spaciousness.\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s just with their own space that they like that clutter.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, and I think its just that they like the security of feeling very- kind of like a cocoon, and they’ll do that gesture where they’ll wrap their arms around their body where they’re kind of enveloped, and that feels secure to them- they like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel, go ahead?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I guess I'm really not buying very much except for food.\n",
      "I'm not bringing anything new into the house.\n",
      "I pretty much have everything I need and want, so if anything we're thinking ahead to downsizing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you've done less shopping, you've gone out less, and you've more just kind of stayed home and had more time to organize and keep the house set up the way you'd like it?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has COVID-19 effected your physical health at all in this time?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No, not in a negative way.\n",
      "In fact I've started swimming again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, wonderful.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I haven't swum regularly since before my daughter was born in 1992.\n",
      "But yeah, I mean just sitting around the house all day and not being able to get out and go on vacation, see friends.\n",
      "I'm really feeling the need for more exercise.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful, that's great, I'm glad to hear that.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about in terms of your mental health or your overall wellbeing, do you feel like you've been effected by COVID in that way?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Well the whole situation really disturbs me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "And I get very angry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "When I see what's going on, but if anything it's simplified my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "A lot of the external pressures are gone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So while you feel stress surrounding news and current events, in terms of your world and your day to day life it's made things simpler and easier, does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Oh yes, very much so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have there been financial impacts on you or on your family?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Actually yes, my husband is self employed and he works with corporate executives doing media training.\n",
      "And so that has always been face to face so a lot of that has gone away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "He's doing some things on Zoom, but yeah that's been a concern.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So there has been an impact it sounds like, just in terms of his business?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And how do you feel that you have been coping since the beginning of these events?\n",
      "What have you found to cope that has been helpful for you?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "You mean with the financial issues?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just overall, generally and in terms of stress, in terms of the changes in your life, either financial changes, or?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I'm just working on living very simply and just remembering to be grateful for what we have and for our health and staying in touch with friends.\n",
      "I love my dog.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Dogs are the most important family members during this period.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I'm surprised he didn't come up here and jump on me, he usually does when I'm on the phone.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "It's overwhelming.\n",
      "I've been thinking a lot lately, because I don't have any children, my husband does, and my mother's passed away and my dad is remarried so he's on a different side of the family.\n",
      "My only blood sibling died also, so I'm sort of like the orphan on my mom's side of the family, because my brother's gone and my mom's gone, and I have no children.\n",
      "I have nieces and nephews.\n",
      "I've just been thinking a lot lately, well I either need to give these photos to my nieces and nephews or I just need to discard them because when I'm gone nobody's going to want them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "I have been thinking along those lines.\n",
      "I mean the chances of me throwing them away are pretty slim right now, but my nieces and nephews are still pretty young, they're like young adults, or at least coming into young adulthood.\n",
      "I have to wait until the right time to give them this stuff, and they may not even want it.\n",
      "A lot of the younger generations, they don't hold onto stuff like previous generations did.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well I remember my grandmother, whenever she passed away she had a lot of photos and family heirlooms and collector's items and we kept a fair amount of them, but we did make the effort to go through the photographs and discarded the ones that we couldn't discern the meaning of.\n",
      "That was-\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:33:59] yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah and that was kind of a nice way to go through them.\n",
      "My parents, ended up inspiring them to go through their photos with my sister and I and if there was a photograph that didn't have a ton of meaning to them and it had no meaning to us they're like, \"Well we'll probably throw it away anyways later.\"\n",
      "It's interesting how so much value is dependent on who has the item.\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Yep, yep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you have any items, or any one item that you consider to be most precious to you?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "One item.\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there any group of items?\n",
      "Participant 25:\n",
      "Well I have some of my mother's jewelry, so that would be precious.\n",
      "I've got my dad's fire department badge, so I've got some jewelry type things that would be keepsakes.\n",
      "My mother had a lot of jewelry too.\n",
      "My mother, I get a lot of my tendencies from my mother, so she had a lot of stuff.\n",
      "Other than that I can't think of anything that would be ... I have a [Treddle 00:35:22] sewing machine that belonged to my grandmother, and that's something that's very valuable.\n",
      "Well it's valuable to me because it's sentimental.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What do you feel then, when you think about possibly losing that item?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I don't think so, I didn't hear that there was a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it's just a thing that he does that doesn't really in the way of his life?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like this person's behavior is similar to yours or different from yours?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Somewhat similar.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Now I'm going to read you another vignette about another person, so let's call this person Jill.\n",
      "Jill has several boxes that she keeps in case she needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to Jill's house she keeps the container the item came, she's worried that she might get rid of a box that she'll need later, and stacks of boxes occupy every one of her rooms.\n",
      "Before entering her room, she must removes several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "Her house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for her to walk in her house.\n",
      "Often it's difficult for Jill to find her car keys and wallet and she'll spend about 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until she eventually finds them.\n",
      "She's almost always late in getting to where she needs because she has so much trouble finding her keys.\n",
      "Do you feel like this is a person with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what makes the difference for you?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "The fact that every room has boxes, that she has to move things out of the way when she enters the room and that she has trouble on a regular basis finding things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So all of those things are signs that this is more of a problem?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, it's negatively impacting her life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So should she try to change her behavior?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what do you think she should do to try to change her behavior?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "She probably should be in therapy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so maybe this is a person who needs help from a psychiatrist or a psychologist to deal with this problem?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I would say so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And do you feel like this person's behavior is similar to or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Different.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what's the difference?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "The difference is that I don't have an excess of items in every room, I don't need to move things around in order to get around, and it's not really impacting my life.\n",
      "I think I'm pretty efficient in what I do, so the clutter's not really getting in the way except that it's an eyesore.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay so for the final vignette I'd like to read you, and then we'll get back to talking, we'll get the last section of the interview.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Well, I originally got it to therapy when I was 18.\n",
      "That was my first therapist.\n",
      "I've been in therapy mostly on, but with some breaks ever since.\n",
      "So that would be...\n",
      "Let see, if I started when I was 18.\n",
      "It was 31 years ago.\n",
      "So I've been in therapy on and off, mostly on ever since.\n",
      "How did I find that therapist?\n",
      "I was very depressed and anorexic in college and I believe I went to health services and they encouraged me to get a therapist.\n",
      "Actually, my grandfather was a doctor, a medical doctor, and I asked him for a referral to a psychiatrist.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay, great.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "So I sought counseling at college and privately to a psychiatrist.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And so you mentioned prior to that, it's difficult when or I guess I should say, you don't like it when people would want to spontaneously drop by.\n",
      "You don't feel prepared for that kind of thing, but how would you say your family and friends feel about your behavior and have you had any conflicts with anybody that's been close to you?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "My partner, that's been an issue, about getting rid of things.\n",
      "That definitely is something that we address.\n",
      "My family of origin, my mother struggles with hoarding.\n",
      "Her influence is such that, if I get rid of something, she will sometimes ask me about it, ask me where it is and be upset if I've gotten rid of it.\n",
      "So that creates conflict for me when I'm trying to fight my tendency to keep things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "I can imagine that's difficult, you trying to move forward and kind of get rid of things also because your partner has expressed that, \"I don't like the clutter and everything.\"\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But when you have your mother saying, \"Hey, well, what happened to this?\n",
      "How could you get rid of this?\" I'm sure that can be difficult.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So that creates a lot of stress being pulled in different directions.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "So can you kind of describe your space where you live?\n",
      "Is it a home and how many bedrooms?\n",
      "Can you kind of go through the house?\n",
      "Interviewer: Totally, yeah.\n",
      "Another interesting thing that has happened with this list, I gave you the list of \"How would you know that somebody has hoarding disorder?\" And some clinicians take it the way you did where it was like, \"How would I diagnose a person and know if they came in my office?\" But some clinicians have started to generate these lists, and I think that they're just interpreting the question differently, I don't think that this is a difference in understanding, but it's very interesting to me nonetheless, they give a list of what a person with hoarding disorder would look like, like what are some other characteristics of that person apart from their hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewee: Like sitting in the waiting room without talking to them, yeah that did kind of cross my mind a little, but you're right I didn't go that direction.\n",
      "That's more of the detective way, like can you tell without someone saying, \"I have trouble throwing things away\", which is obvious that they might have hoarding problems, but could you see.\n",
      "I think there are some interesting things like when we had a hoarding treatment group, when the hoarding treatment group would come into the waiting room, people knew before they said, \"I'm here for hoarding treatment\" that that's what they were there for.\n",
      "They do present differently from clients with other types of anxiety and mood disorders.\n",
      "I think that's why I've always kind of talked about cognitive stuff first, being biased because of my own research, but also because of when we have had that experience of treating lots of disorders but who's in the waiting room, you see a lot more of disheveled, confused, attentionally challenged, forgetting things in the restroom, that kind of stuff going on.\n",
      "Interviewer: So if you were to paint me a picture of a typical hoarding patient, what would they look like?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I would say more quirky and eccentric looking, more disheveled, more chaotic looking, sometimes more socially awkward, but some people with hoarding are really socially engaging and charming, but other people just present as a little bit more socially awkward.\n",
      "Not to the extreme of something like schizophrenia but more in the schizotypy, slightly odd or unusual presentation.\n",
      "Yeah, so that's I think sometimes--and also, probably more struggling across domains.\n",
      "You can have people sitting in the waiting room looking for panic disorder who on all apparent circumstances look quite high functioning, but people with hoarding often times look like they're facing lot's of different struggles.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "That's very hard to say because for all... I mean, there are so many things that I save, I don't interact with them daily.\n",
      "I have various set routines and of all the things that I'm so attached, not getting rid of most items I don't use in a given day.\n",
      "I need to use my laptop and I like to sit on a couch and have reading material around me that I can use, that I can get to when I have time.\n",
      "I mean, some of the things that are important, I really do like our photo albums and memorabilia, I don't really interact with on a daily basis at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you would say for the most part that you don't spend a lot of time with your things except for the necessary items, like your laptop or things you need for work?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Or like, I do have piles of things that I read, it's not for work, but as I said, mail or magazines that I like to read.\n",
      "And so I like to have those around for my spare times when I can get to those things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And when you think about your possessions, how do you determine what's valuable and what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Certainly, sometimes if you spend money on something, you can think it's more valuable but a lot of times for me, it's just the sentimental value.\n",
      "It's the attachments is something that has an association of memory, it's related to the kids or my partner or my parents.\n",
      "And so I am attached to it because of the memory that it evokes and the sentimentality.\n",
      "And so I ended up saving a lot of things because of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So you would say you may spend a lot of money on one item, but if one item maybe more sentimental or evoke certain memories, that one you might consider more valuable.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And what do you...\n",
      "So out out of those possessions, what do you think is the most precious item in the house for you?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Oh, that is really harsh.\n",
      "I have to come up with like one items?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It could be a couple items.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I mean, it's kind of cheating, I do think like photo albums because they kind of evoke so many memories of different phases of life and of my children and of my partner and of my family, so that's kind of cheating in that it's not one off item but it's like one theme.\n",
      "I think I would say, photo albums even though that it's not a finished project but if I had to say one thing, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So basically items that are, that are tied to your family?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And what would happen if you lost these items?\n",
      "Interviewer: I mean, it's tricky because you have this intended use criteria, and then you have to start asking yourself, \"Well who's intent?\" You know like, if you have a four-bedroom home and three of those rooms are filled with stuff, but there's only one person who needs a bedroom, you know like is that acceptable?\n",
      "Is that the intended use for that person?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I mean I guess at that point I'm willing to let it not be hoarding.\n",
      "If they're not seeking treatment, right, so they're not having distress either directly or indirectly due to the hoarding, and they're living happily in their one thing, that then goes to my more \"let people do what they want\" feeling, like don't be a nanny state.\n",
      "Okay, fine, let's focus on those people who do have distress and do have interference and come in with the insight or not, and not worry about that person.\n",
      "But it would be different the replicate to me if I was doing an interview, like I said, a community-based survey to look at the prevalence of hoarding, would I really look at that person and say, \"Nope, they don't have hoarding\"?\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer: I mean I guess it also presents a problem for research, because if you're excluding, like for instance, anyone who's space is managed by someone else, you're never gonna get kids in.\n",
      "If you're excluding people who are not experiencing distress, then your really severe hoarders are never--\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, excellent point.\n",
      "From a public health perspective, you're right, that's the danger.\n",
      "If I just said, \"Fine, I'll let them be subclinical because they're not interference or distress currently\" and I'll move on with my life, that might be fine in the short term because we're giving treatment to the people we want, but in terms of identifying the prevalence of the problem or finding those people before they die in all their relatives inherit their stuff and you create other problems, it doesn't really fix it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But over time, it kind of got out of control because you would get things from other people and that you would not get rid of it.\n",
      "And then you get more.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "You got it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How is it now?\n",
      "What is your clutter problem like now?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, my problem is that I can't get, I have a two car garage and can't get a third of a car in it.\n",
      "It's piled up.\n",
      "I have a bedroom who's piled up with stuff that I kind of wind through and I have a corner of the living room, which has got too much stuff in it and let's see, yes, anything that's a closet or a cabinet is kind of filled.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So pretty much all of your storage space is filled up.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And there are little corners of your house that are used for storage.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "In my computer room, well, you can walk into it and get to the computer, but that's about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So, your computer room is kind of the place that has the most clutter.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Mm.\n",
      "No. Has the most clutter?\n",
      "No, no. I would say the most clutter is in the garage.\n",
      "Well, of course the garage is a big space because it's a two car garage.\n",
      "Then the third bedroom in the house is just about as cluttered as it is, space-wise.\n",
      "Then the computer room would come next.\n",
      "The bedroom has some stuff in it, but it's very livable.\n",
      "And the kitchen, I keep pretty good as far as clutter.\n",
      "I mean, keeping it out.\n",
      "I mean the cupboards and drawers are cluttered with a lot of stuff.\n",
      "And because of the virus, I have cleaned out a little bit there because now I have to stay home and cook.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So the virus has actually given you time to organize it, you might not have had.\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Well, just the kitchen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Would you say that you'd be able-\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "My patio, oh, I have a patio too, out in the backyard and half of it, about a third of it has clutter in it, that doesn't move, but it's patio-type clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Would you say that your behavior is a problem right now?\n",
      "Do you consider it to be something that is a problem in your life?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Would I consider what is your problem?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your clutter.\n",
      "Do you do find it to be a problem?\n",
      "Participant 24:\n",
      "Oh yes.\n",
      "It's been a problem for umpteen years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "So you see it as something that you'd like to change?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, I don't put a lot of value in my material possessions.\n",
      "I sort of look towards the money aspect of it.\n",
      "What's valuable to me are my stocks.\n",
      "I have an amount that moves every day, and I could see what that amount is, so I could see if the value's up, down, growing, where my car, I value having a car, I need a car, but my car I bought brand new 10 years ago, and it's still running fine.\n",
      "I've had people say to me, \"Participant 021, why don't you go out and buy yourself a new truck?\n",
      "Sell some of them stocks.\n",
      "Buy yourself a new truck,\" and it's like, I would like a new truck but I don't need a new truck, because the car's running just fine.\n",
      "So I don't put a lot of value in material things.\n",
      "I put more value in the securities that I have, and I enjoy trading them.\n",
      "Like I say, making money in the stock market is always enjoyable.\n",
      "It hurts when you're not making money or you lose money, but over the long run I'm doing okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What about when you think about, like you said, you have multiple telescopes and a lot of paintings and multiple desks, what about those items?\n",
      "When you think about them, what makes them valuable or why aren't they valuable?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, the telescopes are valuable because astronomy is a hobby of mine, and it's just mind blowing when you do a little reading and you go out there and you look at things you've read about, and some of the things that happen that go on in space, just the speed of light alone...\n",
      "The other night I went out and I looked at the Andromeda Galaxy, which is two and a half million light years away, which you can see with the naked eye.\n",
      "For me, it blows my mind to think, to just try to...\n",
      "We can't comprehend that distance, because light travels at 186,000 miles a second, and it takes two and a half million years to get here.\n",
      "So things like the telescope, I do put value in that, because it really motivates... I mean, it's like having a time machine.\n",
      "You're looking back in time.\n",
      "When I look at that galaxy, the light left there two and a half million years ago, and so I'm looking back two and a half million years.\n",
      "I find that valuable, because it motivates me to look for other things.\n",
      "But other things, my computer is valuable because that leads me out to the outside world where you can see just about everything now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What I'm getting from this is that you kind of value things that are interesting to you and help you learn, so you value your computer because you can access to chess games or tournaments and the stock market and-\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer: We talked in the beginning of the interview about the reasons that people give for keeping their animals or for hoarding animals, and I wonder if in your mind those reasons are actually what is driving their behavior, or are those reasons kind of a post-hoc justification for what is a kind of fundamental underlying need to--?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think that's closer to the reality partly because of the actual situation.\n",
      "They say, \"Well I'm saving these animals or otherwise they would just be abandoned or would die\" or whatever, and that's I guess another quality we really haven't discussed.\n",
      "It's one of the things that's almost universal in the animal hoarders, is this strong aversion to euthanasia under any conditions.\n",
      "The big disconnect between animal hoarders, rescue hoarders in particular and conventional animal shelters or animal rescue groups that will euthanize animals for illness or extreme behavior problems or whatever--is accepting the notion of a life not worth living.\n",
      "Our view in conventional animal protection is there are worse things than death for an animal, or for a human in my view, and living a life of pain and suffering with open bleeding wounds and severed spines and things like that are in view of most of us a life of not worth living, a fate worth death.\n",
      "That concept of a life not worth living is totally aliens to animal hoarders.\n",
      "What you hear time and time again is, \"Well it's alive,\" and coupled with that is their own fear of mortality--and again, that I think relates back to the fact that for many hoarders and animal hoarders, one of the triggering events seems to be loss, death of a child, death of a sibling, death of a parent, death of a spouse.\n",
      "And that's something you don't worry about with object hoarding, except the intent that they view losing a loved object as being equivalent to killing it or having it die.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I mean, I'd be very upset.\n",
      "With photos.\n",
      "A lot of them are now digitized so you can replace them to some extent, but if they were like lost, I feel tremendous loss.\n",
      "I feel really sad.\n",
      "I'd feels a lot of anxiety and grief over the loss of that because as I said, I can't remember everything.\n",
      "And so having something visual that can take me to another time and remind me of things that I've experienced in different phases of life is very important.\n",
      "So I feel a very significant loss.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I totally understand that.\n",
      "So really it would be a saddening experience that it would really truly feel like you had lost.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think a lot of distress, that's part of my anxiety and my over-attachment to things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you're going through your items, how do you choose between your items and also how do you distinguish between trash and what's not trash and when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "Well, that's part of the problem.\n",
      "It's very hard for me to distinguish between things because there really are some things that are more important than others some more sentimental and yet I have a problem partying with the lower tier items that shouldn't be that difficult.\n",
      "Even old T-shirts that I don't wear anymore and that aren't really that important to me.\n",
      "It's very, very hard for me to part with them.\n",
      "So wait, you were saying, how do I...\n",
      "You asked a few questions about how do I choose-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I mean, that's the problem.\n",
      "I have trouble doing that, so I try to think of the things that are more special or they're most pleasing.\n",
      "I collect ceramics, and if there's a vase that I think is more aesthetically beautiful than another one, I'd probably, if I had to choose between them, I would get rid of the one I don't like as much whether the colors are different or the shape or something like that.\n",
      "But it's actually very hard for me to get rid of any of those items.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "And then when do I actually get rid of things?\n",
      "I mean, sometimes it's juts that-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you know when it's time to get rid of it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's wonderful, that's great.\n",
      "I just have a couple of demographic questions here to wrap up and then I will get your address so that I can send you your gift card, and thank you so much for-\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interview 002\n",
      "Interviewee: It's surprising to me that experts are disagreeing that much when we have the actual DSM-V criteria.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, we can talk about it.\n",
      "Let me get--I would like to talk about it with you at the end of the interview so that I can get your, your kind of off the cuff impressions first.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh right, good point.\n",
      "Unbiased, yeah, good point.\n",
      "Interviewer: But no, I would love to hear your thoughts about results because you know we're nearing 30 interviews, and these are interviews really with people who are the experts of all experts on this disorder, the group that we would hope would have the most consistent responses.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, that's what's kind of worrying but, like you said, we'll talk about that at the end.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: But yeah, you would hope that the 30 of us would have come to an agreement.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, so there is agreement on some topics, but there's still disagreement on some aspects so, I think it's worthwhile to know about that.\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, so those are all the lists that I have for you today, I really appreciate you doing that with me.\n",
      "Now I'd like to move more into the interview.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, that was fun.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I mean it's always interesting particularly to see, at least we've just been interviewing clinicians, but the list that is most different I think is the underlying causes, and it really depends on people's backgrounds, the things that might contribute to hoarding disorder, which is probably not a surprise to you.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "It's interesting, probably I think the whole trauma thing is a big divider.\n",
      "There's a group of people, maybe clinicians more so, who just think it all comes down to trauma, and then I think there's a variance with researchers who think it's a factor but not the whole factor, is that what's happening?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I mean it tends to be people who answer genetics or biology as their first answer and then they generate a certain kind of list, and people who answer something more kind of cognitive like you did like attention or like cognitive function, and then there's maybe like a third group who give very psychological sort of answers where it's more like about the person's life and experiences.\n",
      "And that's just a general trend, people have always seemed to have a mix, but the order that they put them in I think will be very interesting to breakdown based on different kinds of clinicians and researchers, how they think about it.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, cuz unfortunately all these things are so messy, there's gonna be an interaction of all those things, and I didn't mention genetics but I do think that creates a backdrop when these things happen.\n",
      "So then I guess the question is the relative contribution is more interesting, because probably genetics do play a role, yeah probably beliefs do play a role, and yes stressful early life events might contribute, so then I guess the question is what are the most important factors, or what people, I guess the clinicians, think is most important and whether or not that's what the clients think it most important.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you would like it to just be the same room but just with all of the clutter completely gone?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any items that you consider clutter that you would keep?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I guess I'm wondering are any of the items important to you or that you like but maybe not in the right place right now?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "No, those kinds of things I don't have a problem dealing with if I like them.\n",
      "But it's mostly the paperwork, the books, the newspapers and the toys.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And ideally you would just like all of that stuff to be gone?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think about feeling at home in your space, do you feel like it's nice to have your items around or to have books to look at or papers to read?\n",
      "Do you feel like those items are important for you feeling at home, or ideally they would just be gone and you don't really need them in your home space?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I think what's relevant I would like to have.\n",
      "Reading materials that I'm currently reading, but the clutter that I'm talking about goes back years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you're not attached to that at all, you would just like to eliminate it?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I would, but I just can't seem to get to it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So we've talked a little bit about being sentimentally attached to items, and I guess thinking about all of the things in your home, which ones are the most important to you, which ones do you value?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Which items?\n",
      "I would say the house itself, certain rooms that I enjoy being in, I would have to say that if the place burned down what would I miss?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "If I had to replace everything I would be okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you miss those sentimental items from your children's childhood?\n",
      "Are there items like that that you feel very attached to?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "You know what?\n",
      "I would feel a sense of relief because then the decision will have been made for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It will save you the task of having to-\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Absolutely yeah, because sometimes I've gone through stuff in the basement and papers and things have gotten kind of moldy and falling apart.\n",
      "I'm like, well I should just throw this away, and then it's like, thank god.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah it's gone, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So how do you make decisions about throwing things away?\n",
      "How do you decide when it's time to just toss it?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "You mean going forward or with these things that have accumulated?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, I would have to say my computer, because when I get up in the morning, that's the first thing I do pretty much every morning, is get on the computer and check out... I play at chess tournaments, so the first thing I do, some tournaments you have to move within one day, some every three days.\n",
      "I go and I make all my moves on the chess games I play.\n",
      "I'm into investing in stocks, so I've got to check the stock... my stock portfolio, see what's going on with that.\n",
      "It's almost a ritual when I get up.\n",
      "I make coffee.\n",
      "I sit down at the computer, and I'm going to be there for a couple hours.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So that's what you spend most of your time with, is your computer?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Well, yeah, on a regular basis, every day.\n",
      "I mean, I can't think of a day where I go on...\n",
      "I'm not on the computer first thing, and then I'm usually back on it to check on things later in the day.\n",
      "When I think about it now, I think back when I was younger, and it's like how did we get along without computers, you know?\n",
      "So I find that real interesting.\n",
      "Because, like I say, the stocks are really kind of important to me, and I'm learning options now, and options, it's a struggle just to understand it and learn them.\n",
      "Every day I try to go a little bit farther and learn a little bit more and understand it, so it's almost like a course that I'm putting myself through.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's kind of cool.\n",
      "Stocks are pretty complicated.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Oh, options, options will drive you...\n",
      "But I'm just learning and I'm starting easy with covered calls, which are not real, real risky.\n",
      "You even have to get permission from the brokers, because they want to check you out, because some people make some stupid mistakes, and you can lose a lot of money on options if you're not sure of what you're doing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This next thing we're going to talk about is value.\n",
      "When you think about all of your possessions, what makes them valuable and how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes. So you really highlighted the whole keeping papers and then also some memorabilia from your kids, are those mainly the parts of your home that you would consider cluttered and what areas are the most cluttered and what are in those areas that are cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 23:\n",
      "I mean, we are cluttered everywhere.\n",
      "You could just tell, even in the areas that...\n",
      "It's not like a minimalist house, every shelf has things on it.\n",
      "So that's just general.\n",
      "When you walk into a house, you can see if it's a minimalist house or it's a really people who have a lot of stuff.\n",
      "We tend to have more stuff.\n",
      "But the areas that are, I guess, the most clutter or where I sit like on the couch, they're always piles of papers next to the couch or on the couch or behind the couch, or all three of those things.\n",
      "So it's where I spend my time whether I'm working or not.\n",
      "It's where I sit to do things.\n",
      "There's some of that in the living room.\n",
      "And then we do have some clutter problems, like I said, in the basement, that's kind of our overflow area.\n",
      "And so it tends to really overflow with stuff.\n",
      "And also closets because there isn't a lot of storage in the house, closets tend to be overly full.\n",
      "It's not the kind of thing where you open the closet door and everything's falling out, but there's stuff on the floor and there's stuff on hangers and then their piles of things on a shelf on top.\n",
      "And it's always more full than is ideal for being user-friendly because we can't find things easily.\n",
      "So a lot of the storage areas, as I said are kind of above capacity and they're not really as useful as they should be or as tidy because there's too much stuff in there.\n",
      "So we have some of that in the kitchen because we have some shelves there there's sort of overly full.\n",
      "I said about the living room.\n",
      "And my bedroom closets and we have on that third floor, we have an office space that ends up being overflow storage and that gets... I clean it every so often, but it gets cluttered, very cluttered with simpler papers like our daughter's schoolwork that we see because I save some of it, memorabilia, things that we have, photo album, photos that need to be put in albums that haven't put in yet, things like that.\n",
      "We have some of that in the dining room, too.\n",
      "We have like projects that are sort of in process, but aren't finished and that bleeds into spaces that we would like clear like a dining room shouldn't really have a photo project in it.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "First of all, you can walk through all the rooms in my house.\n",
      "Secondly, I don't...\n",
      "I'm just thinking of that TV show.\n",
      "I don't keep everything that comes into the house.\n",
      "I don't keep all the newspapers, all the magazines, all the food trays.\n",
      "My sink is always empty, but that's because of Jerry.\n",
      "He does the dishes.\n",
      "My things are very, very clean and that's what people comment on because I take people through my house when friends come over.\n",
      "If they haven't seen my house, I take them through my whole house.\n",
      "They say that I am the most clean, organized hoarder they've ever met.\n",
      "I think my things are clean.\n",
      "When my grandchildren come or when other people come, they have to wash their hands before they pick anything up.\n",
      "I don't want to have dirty stuff around.\n",
      "No dirty toys, nothing.\n",
      "It's also organized.\n",
      "The window sills have stuff lined up on them.\n",
      "The tables, like how some people decorate for Christmas and you go into their house and there's no empty space because they have Christmas stuff all around, that's my house all year round.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "It sounds like some differences are that your place is clean and people can walk through all the rooms.\n",
      "You don't keep everything.\n",
      "That you're able to use places like your sink.\n",
      "Is that correct?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "And all the bathrooms are clean.\n",
      "There's not a lot of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know we mentioned earlier some ways to identify hoarding disorder and you mentioned some things like some hoarders you think about them being overweight, being older.\n",
      "They might talk about an item, shop for a lot of different things.\n",
      "Are there any other ways that you might be able to identify someone with hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "If not, that's okay too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you looked in their car, probably they would have a lot of stuff in their car.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I don't know if it's just that TV show that colors the way I think of hoarders.\n",
      "This is being pretty prejudice, but I just see the ones that are on TV.\n",
      "They don't seem to have a really high IQ except for the ones on...\n",
      "What's that road show where they go out to people's barns?\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "They go out to people's barns and they find people that have collected all this stuff in their dusty barns and they buy it from them.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Jerry's not here.\n",
      "He would know the name of the show.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I feel like that I'm well educated, and I'm in control.\n",
      "If I didn't feel that way, I would do something about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 27:\n",
      "I just feel like... I don't know that I would recognize a hoarder.\n",
      "I just feel like hoarders are out of control.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your telescopes you value because you can learn things about space and different things like that.\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is that what you're saying?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So then how do you describe what is trash for you or what you discard?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "How do I describe what is trash?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so when you're looking at something, you're like, \"To me this is trash.\"\n",
      "For me, when I look at a wrapper, I'm like, \"Oh, that's trash.\n",
      "I have to get rid of this,\" you know?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Oh, yeah, when it comes to things like garbage and wrappers and old paper and old boxes, I get rid of those.\n",
      "I don't have a lot of garbage laying around in my house.\n",
      "But there are things that I sort of know are trash but I struggle even so with getting rid of them.\n",
      "I could give you an example.\n",
      "I bought an old, old clock at an auction once, and it's very old.\n",
      "I looked at it and it didn't quite work, and I took it... I played around with it.\n",
      "I decided I couldn't get it running, so I looked it up online, and there are people that collect old clocks.\n",
      "I found this clock that somebody was selling, and they were asking $75 for it, so to me it has some value because people collect it.\n",
      "But mine is in pieces and it's really trash, and it's... I picked that clock up probably five times and said, \"All right, put it in the car.\n",
      "Next time I'm out, I'm going to get rid of it, donate it, throw it out, whatever,\" because it's pieces.\n",
      "But I know that it has value to somebody, and if I could connect with that person, I could sell it to them.\n",
      "I probably wouldn't get 75 bucks for it, but I probably could get 15 or 20 dollars for it.\n",
      "To me, I know it's trash in the condition it's in.\n",
      "I'll never get it back together but it has value at the same time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Kind of like, correct me if I'm wrong, but what I'm understanding is that you're holding onto it because you know it has some value in someone else's eyes, but you don't necessarily see it as valuable?\n",
      "Participant 021:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It has no value to me because I'll never get it running, but I know it has value, and it's just a matter of meeting the right person.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about, you know you could imagine two patients, right, and they're exhibiting, they have the exact same cognition, perhaps they have the same life experience these two hypothetical patients, they save the same amount of items, and one of them has a lot of money and can afford to buy six storage areas and has basically a mansion to live in; whereas, the other one lives in a one bedroom apartment.\n",
      "So, one of them is going to have the appearance of much much much more clutter than the other, although they both have the same kind of underlying...even like brain behavior, you know what I mean like they have the same thoughts.\n",
      "How do you decide that--would you decide that they both have hoarding disorder, although one of them isn't cluttered?\n",
      "Would you decide that only the person in the apartment has hoarding disorder or, what?\n",
      "How would you make that call?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, I think I would still be going back to conflict in distress in that case.\n",
      "They might both very well have hoarding disorder.\n",
      "We have had lots of hoarding clients who say that, \"If I just had enough money to buy enough storage to put all my stuff, I wouldn't have any problem.\"\n",
      "But, okay, the one in the bedroom apartment would be a clear-cut case, okay you have hoarding disorder.\n",
      "But the millionaire with the mansion, it's kind of the way the world works that probably that still would be causing them problems and conflicts, even with their family members not wanting them to be spending all this money on continuously setting up storage spaces and taking up more and more room in the mansion for their stuff.\n",
      "And they might start having some insight into it, so I think that that person, depending on how that behavior was impacting them, could still meet for hoarding.\n",
      "I guess you can imagine a case where they don't have any friends or family and they just keep filling up mansion after mansion, in this surreal experiment--and then I would probably say low insight, like yeah it's still hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Also, it's an example that we thought of because it was a real example that was given of a person who had a patient who was so rich that they could afford to keep everything and pay someone to organize it.\n",
      "And the clinician that we talked to--\n",
      "Interviewee: And pay someone to organize it, wow that's another idea too.\n",
      "Right, because that would've been part of the problem.\n",
      "So they could actually have someone to organize it and they just keep adding and adding.\n",
      "Wow, what do other people think about that one?\n",
      "Now that I'm answering, that's a tough one.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, I mean the clinician who reported the example said that she thought it probably was, but based on this criteria, couldn't give that diagnosis and instead classified it as OCD unspecified for the purposes of realism.\n",
      "Because the person didn't meet the clutter criteria and didn't experience distresses, so.\n",
      "Interviewee: Painful\n",
      "Interviewer: So where is animal hoarding in relation to other disorders?\n",
      "So there's high comorbidity of depression or with object hoarding often.\n",
      "Interviewee: Right, right, we certainly do see a number of different potential co-morbidities.\n",
      "Initially we used to talk about animal addicts, we used to view it as a form of addictive behavior, and again quite a few of our hoarders also do seem to have substance abuse problems or quite a few in my experience have been children of substance abusers, particularly daughters of alcoholics, it seems to not be an uncommon scenario.\n",
      "So there are those problems, there is depression, there have seen some with schizophrenia, some seem to perhaps be borderline personality.\n",
      "So there are a lot of potential co-occurring things that again might be part of the whole process of the onset of hoarding might be related to a lot of other attachment disorders.\n",
      "Our current thinking seems to be more along the line of attachment disorders rather than obsessive-compulsive disorder partly because, and I don't have a lot of experience working with obsessive-compulsive disorders but, one of the main differences I know in the literature and in my experience is the level of insight that somebody who is involved in engaging with, let's say repetitive behaviors and #1 knows that that is unusual and might even be somewhat disturbed by that.\n",
      "The hoarders I meet are again extremely defensive and I wouldn't say enjoy their hoarding, but one of the lines we hear quite often is without the animals in their care they will die.\n",
      "There is a lot of suicidal ideation and we used to be kind of inclined to dismiss that as a strange abnormal attachment they had, but we have had a couple of instances of hoarders who have committed suicide, which is why when we do a rescue operation, and particularly on a rescue hoarder that might have a large number of animals, we always bring along a mental health team as well and even ambulances in some cases.\n",
      "And to the first part of the--so, the main distinguishing characteristics, it varies in the different states what percentage of animal hoarders are also object hoarders but it's pretty high.\n",
      "In my experience most of them at least have some degree of other object hoarding, and sometimes it is extensive.\n",
      "Sometimes we have object hoarding situations where the large number of animals present are not necessarily part of the original intent, but you have tons of news papers and news papers attract rodents and rodents attract cats, and you wind up with a large number of cats even though you're not a cat hoarder.\n",
      "But certainly in many of the animal hoarding situations that animal care and control or the main law enforcement go in on, you are maneuvering your way through your lab of newspapers and trash and all kinds of stuff.\n",
      "So, there is certainly a lot of overlap there, there are a couple of things that I think potentially make animal hoarding different.\n",
      "There's a level of viewing objects that you hoard with human characteristics or again you hear people saying, \"If I throw this out it's like killing it.\"\n",
      "Even though it's a record, or a bottle or a magazine.\n",
      "Some of them will attribute the hoarding to a trauma in their life.\n",
      "And again, some of them will really downplay it and say that it’s not really that big a deal and they just need time to take care of it, but you know its been 10, 20, 30 years and they still haven’t found the time to deal with it.\n",
      "A lot of them will use the excuse “well I’ve never had the time to take care of it.”\n",
      "And in terms of this mental health problem, I think there’s been kind of an evolution there; in early days when I first started with hoarding, a lot of people would say that this is not a mental health issue; and they’ve been much more inclined to work with a professional organizer or friends to help them clean up their stuff, but I think in recent years people have been much more on board with the idea that this is indeed a mental health issue.\n",
      "They’ve kind of been more on board with that, but that’s the evolution I think over the last 8 to 10 years.\n",
      "Interviewer: So its there’s of been a movement of people being more accepting that this is an actual disorder instead of just a problem of organization that they can cope with.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: The other one we’d like you to think through how your patents would respond is “How convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding them?” What do you think your patients would say in response to that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Again, a range.\n",
      "But again, what we’d come up with is ‘I need to keep it because it’ll come in useful, I’ll need it for later on, sentimental reasons, creativity reasons, being prepared reasons.’\n",
      "Interviewer: So most of your patients seem very convinced that they actually need to keep the things.\n",
      "Is there also that element that something bad will come of discarding it or something bad will happen if they throw it away?\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh probably.\n",
      "‘That they’ll be audited by the tax man,’ is a very common one; someone else will be mad at them, you know, “If I throw this book away my husband will be mad at me because he might want it,” so they like to put that on other people too; or you know “If I get rid of it, I wont have it down the line and it will be catastrophic if I don’t have this particular Tupperware box;” or “it’s a feeling of catastrophe for not having it,” is a common one- kind of exaggerated consequences of not having something that they needed.\n",
      "Interviewer: And kind of in your opinion or your experience, do you think these explanations are post hoc reasons to justify this underlying pathological need or do you think that they’re in some sense real reasons?\n",
      "Which do you think maybe came first, the urge to save or the reason for saving?\n",
      "Interviewee: Gosh I never really thought of it like that.\n",
      "That’s a good question.\n",
      "You know I think that, just at the top of my head, I think I’d be more inclined to think that they save the stuff and then come up with the rationale, I think.\n",
      "Uhm, but I’m not entirely sure.\n",
      "But that makes more sense, I think they do, I think they’re keeping it and keeping it and they’re looking at it and keeping this rationale that kind of makes sense for them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, it is interesting and I guess for me, there's like so many things that are interesting.\n",
      "So, something that I wanted to ask you about as well as somebody who's seen patients in Australia and also in the U.S., if you were to say hoarding is really behavioral and the reasons that people give, I mean regardless of why people give the reasons they give, part of the reasons that they give is to justify their saving behavior.\n",
      "So, what they're saying when they give the reason for saving to justify it is like, \"Oh but this is acceptable saving in some culturally agreed upon way.\"\n",
      "So, like, \"I'm not crazy, I'm saving this for a rational reason.\"\n",
      "So the reasons that they give kind of give away a little bit--\n",
      "Interviewee: post hoc justifications\n",

      "I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And why, what makes the difference?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Because she feels the need to accumulate antiques whether or not she needs them, it sounds like she doesn't have room for them and it sounds like she has more than she can handle so it's cluttering her life and her mind.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it doesn't matter to you in this case that one person is saving boxes and the other person is saving valuable antiques?\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "In which way?\n",

      "Okay, so hoarders, more out of control, messy cars, maybe lower IQ, although it sounds like that could not always be the case.\n",
      "Thinking about where you get information about hoarding disorder, it sounds like some of it is from those TV shows.\n",

      "A lot yeah, in the basement there's a lot of stuff, there's some stuff in the attic.\n",
      "I'm looking around my bedroom and it's a fairly large bedroom but the only clutter I see is a pile of newspapers and mail that frankly goes back years that's sitting in the corner on a table.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Well my desk is in the family room, so I've got a lot of papers on the desk and I brought in a folding table and put more papers on that folding table and then there was shelves there with toys and books that the kids no longer use.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what space in your home is the space that either you spend the most time in or that you like to spend time in the most?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "Well the kitchen just because, well because.\n",
      "But mostly it's the family room because it's a very big room and it has big windows and I get to see outside and it's pretty in all of the seasons.\n",
      "But if that were free of clutter I would be so happy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you like that room to look like?\n",
      "Participant 26:\n",
      "I would like it to only have the furniture that I need which I pretty much do, and no clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer: Okay, do you believe that, or have you seen cases of subclinical hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Rarely, sometimes, sometimes the young people will do some testing with undergraduates and we see like, \"oh dear, this could be hoarding one day.\"\n",
      "Right now to keep it all in their dorm room or they live with their parents and it's all in their room, but the emotional attachment that they have to possessions makes us fearful that they will eventually when they hit 30, 40, 50, have it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well so, that brings me to a question that I was going to ask you later but I can ask now, it said: as I'm sure you're aware, the literature shows that hoarding disorder's more common in elderly people, and I guess what I'm wondering is do you see that as being kind of like... it is progressive?\n",
      "Interviewee: An artifact.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, and it's progressive in the sense that it gets worse as you age or do you see it as a result of social factors like elderly people have had more time to accumulate items, perhaps they have had their parents die and dump a bunch of items on them, perhaps their children are now out of the house and their spouse has divorced them because of this behavior and now it's all out of control and that's why we're seeing them?\n",
      "So like has the impulse gotten worse over their lifespan, or has it just gotten to the point in older people where they can no longer control it, also because of cognitive or mobility issues?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think both of those things and an artifact of the way that we do research and when people finally develop insight motivation.\n",
      "So, sometimes people who have hoarding problems in their 20s and 30s haven't had enough problems associated with it, were not coming in for treatment, but yeah I do think that actually, I wish I could pick one or the other, but it's both.\n",
      "I think that people do...the hoarding impulse might get stronger, they might get more disheveled, more life stressors over time, but also that you're right, it's just the sheer volume of stuff adds up, which is not what you get with other disorders.\n",
      "But, people we see now that are undergrads, they might have had serious hoarding urges, but the amount of stuff that they've saved is still able to be contained in a room, and if they keep on at this going rate, it's like with eating habits and things sometimes you think that if you could just, if you said, \"If this is what you eat every day, this is what you'll look like in 10 years\", same thing with hoarding.\n",
      "Like, \"If you continue to hold on to this much stuff, this is like your house will look like in 10 years.\"\n",
      "But right now it doesn't just because time hasn't allowed that much stuff to accumulate, which is your second point.\n",
      "But also, yeah I think that because there's those factors of trauma and stresses, that people who might've been sentimental savors and then have stressful life events happen, their depression got worse, they have become...have had other medical problems and the actual hoarding tendencies also became stronger, as well as, like you said, the accumulation of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Besides that big surgery, how is your mental health or overall well-being been?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I am an introvert. [inaudible 00:29:39] introvert and even I have had, sometimes I go, \"Geez, it'd be nice to be able to go and see someone.\" Another thing that it has done is impact my ability to drive. My best friend lives about three and a half hours away. I cannot physically drive to see her because my leg was severely impacted by the spinal stenosis. It still has not recuperated. I can't have it in one position for more than about 20 minutes when you're driving.\n",

      "It's impossible for me to go visit my best friend. We can talk on the phone, but I'm really okay. Given a choice between being in a crowd and being alone, give me alone. So, from the point of view of social isolation, I almost welcome it because I am very introverted.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "And I think that might be something to look at, too, if these people are introverts or extroverts. To see if that would have an impact on their clutter problems.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, that's a very interesting concept to think about because most times people tend to live alone or they also comment that they're introverts. So, has COVID affected your buying habits? Do you tend to shop a lot?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Not really. I don't go to the store very much because the stores around here, on 75, stores around here, have the senior hours from six to seven A.M. which I appreciate that they have senior hours, but, yeah, six to seven A.M. is not a time I'm up and about. Bright eyed and bushy tailed. I, as I said, am grateful that they have the shopping hours, but I don't get out to them too much. I'll get things online. I know that that is one issue that people in my situation have, is buying too much online.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say you've been buying a lot online? Like more than normal?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I don't think more than normal. No, I don't think more than normal. I try to be more conscious about it and not get too carried away with online shopping. I know it can be a very dangerous habit to have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, it's very easy to click a button.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Oh, yes, too easy. [crosstalk 00:32:41] You can imagine it's the same thing because I have been to very many casinos, but when I lived in Philadelphia, when Atlantic city casinos first opened back in the early 70s, and there was a conference there that co-workers and I went to, and we agreed that we could spot at this casino because none of us had ever been. I took a roll of quarters and kept the quarters, I put them in my left pocket, and I would put them in. This was physical where you pull the one armed bandit and pull it down, and the things go around.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I keep my keys and my pocketbook in a specific place. If I put it somewhere else ... I'll give you an example of a couple of weeks ago. I had my keys in my hand and I came in from doing roofing work on the apartment building that I live in. I came in a different entrance and I had a piece of paper in my hand and my car keys. Of course, I had to go to the bathroom right away. So, I put those down and then I couldn't find my car keys.\n",
      "Fortunately, I have another key that I could use and lo and behold, I had put the keys and then put the piece of paper on top of the keys. So, I didn't see the keys when I was looking for them and it was sheer good luck that I found them. I would say that I'm early 99% of the time and rarely late because that's how I grew up. You get there early. At least, 10 minutes early or, else, you're not on time. So, that is not me at all, but if I don't put something in exactly the same place, then I lose track of it easily.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do you think that his behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "See, I never considered this ... I never heard that a psychiatrist would treat that. If there's treatment available, then yeah, that'd be super.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. There are treatment options available if you see a psychiatrist. Okay, so you would say that one does?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Oh, excuse me. Okay. So, this next one, John Doe has books that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. Books occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove ... Oh, my god, excuse me. Okay. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of the items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallets, so he'll spend 10, 20 minutes looking for them, until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "My opinion, yeah, I would say ... I'm grateful to say I don't have to move anything out of the tub or move anything out of the [crosstalk 00:50:44] door. I'm feeling a little bit better about myself. [crosstalk 00:50:47] Not that I would take pictures of my place and send them to you, but I, at least, can get from point A to point B, and take a shower, and walk indoors, and wash my dishes and use my stove.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. So the next story, I'm going to read you another story. Here we go. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When the items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for him to walk in his house. Often, it's difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all. So in your opinion does this person have ...\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "No. Yes, he's a clutter. He's a terrible clutter and that's not me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Clutter. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "That's not me. I have papers in every room, but I would never have papers so I couldn't get out the door I couldn't ... that's ridiculous. And like things that I have... I have a computer that's old and I want to throw it away but I need to get it right. And it's sitting in my office. It needs to be gotten rid of and I want to get rid of it. It's just I haven't because I don't know where to take it. Sometimes when those things come up, I'm not in the right place at the right time, so those kind of things. But no. I'm not like that. And I'm always usually early or on time, I think. So ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Perfect. Okay. And do you think this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And why do you say that?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yes. Because he can't get through his house. There's something wrong. My aunt had a neighbor like that and I gave her this gift and she gave it to her neighbor, because her neighbor coveted it, but you go to her neighbor's house and she can barely make a path through the house and their neighbor didn't really ... I got mad she gave it away because this neighbor just wanted it to put in her piles of crap.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "People that can't get into their house and stuff like that, there's something wrong. Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Definitely. Okay. Perfect. So okay. I have another story for you. Okay. John Doe has clothes that he likes to keep in case he needs to use them in the future. Clothes occupy most of his room except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Oh my god.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Now, we're just going to talk a little bit about distinguishing typical hoarding behavior from what would be considered normal behavior? So, what would you consider the most important difference between what is considered normal, sane behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Organization and the ability to dis-attach. Ability to, maybe, accept that it's not really perfect and it will never be perfect. To make it the best you can.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah, just keeping on top of things every day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What would you say hoarding disorder looks like and how is that same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "You just can't get rid of stuff. It's about the same. You bring stuff in and then, you buy a pair of socks and you don't get rid of a pair of socks. You just have a lot of pair of socks. I think it's an inability to balance the intake with the outflow, perhaps.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that's a really good way of putting it. No one's ever said that. Where would you say you get most of your information about hoarding disorder from? Do you read about it or do you watch news?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "No. No, no, no. I live it, so why would I need those things? Why would I need to read about it? I never read anything that helps me. I do see the books and the KonMari Method, and the problem with that is everything feels wonderful for me, so I can't risk [crosstalk 00:43:44].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When did you first learn of this term or this disorder?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea. I couldn't tell you. I know that there was ... I used to work for television [listing 00:44:08], and what is that, Hoarders, or something that's around that I can't bring myself to watch. A&E, I think?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it is Hoarders.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Okay, that's Hoarders. Yeah, and I think that's probably where we adapted to the term.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right. This last section is what we call little vignettes. Basically, they're little scenarios and then at the end ... I'm going to read you a little paragraph and then, at the end, you're just going to say if you think this person has hoarding disorder or if it's more being cluttered, and then, if they should try to change their behavior and if you think they need treatment from a psychiatrist, and if their behavior is similar or different to your own. Then I can go over the questions again after I read them.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What do you think makes them cluttered? Specific items or anything?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Oh my gosh, I kept thinking that I'm retired, I'm going to do this craft and that craft and so forth. After I retired, I took a few classes for things I wanted to do and I started gathering all the equipment, the tools, the accessories that I would need to do all of these crafts. I have piles of jewelry making supplies, sewing supplies and the equipment, stained glass supplies. I mean it just goes on and on. By and large I've lost interest in a lot of those through the years anyway. I really need to move things away. But I keep thinking, I spent money on that and time on that, I really need to keep that in case I want to do it again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. Then would you say that your things are important for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I'm sorry, I didn't understand.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How important are your things for you to feel at home? If you didn't have them, would you feel less at home than you would now?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I don't think so. I think I'd feel better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, all right. Do you know which ones are the most important to you? I know you said that you lost interest in some of them back in March. But have you found others that are more important to you? And tend to spend more time with?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah. I would like to get back to painting, so I'd like to keep those supplies. I would like to continue sewing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. Then are there parts of your home that you don't use? For example, for cooking, you wouldn't be using it for cooking, or you wouldn't be using your bathtub for bathing?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you would pretty much use everything, there's no areas of your house that are inaccessible?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right. When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable? How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "If it has use for me, either now or possibly in the future. If it would save me money.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No go ahead, sorry.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I was going to say, instead of going out and purchasing again, if I think I might need it, I'd like to hang onto it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah, yeah. What would be trash for you? And would you discard?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:11:39] discarding anything other than normal kitchen scraps and recyclables from the kitchen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. How do you know when it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I really don't. I have a real problem with that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. Do you have a most precious item in your house?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Well, photos of my family, I think. And the few things that were left to me from my grandmother, and that's about it really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. At the same time, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he's usually late in getting to where he needs to be. So in your opinion, does this person have hoarding disorder-\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... or clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Clutter. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Not hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Not hoarding.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Well, maybe a bit of both because he's saving clothes for if he needs them, and I do that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I mean, I have seven Patagonia jackets because I love Patagonia jackets. Do I wear them all? No. I don't wear them all. They sit in there and I try to rotate them. But I have a closet. I have two closets. I have one here and one up there and I periodically get rid of stuff. What my problem is, there's pairs of jeans on the floor that need to be patched and I need to embroider the patches and that takes a long time and I haven't had the time, so the stuff sits on the floor. That kind of thing. That kind of thing. But, no. I'm not late because I can't find things and get out of the house. I mean, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of course. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I try not to be late for anything. That's a pet peeve of mine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great. Okay. Let's see ... oh, here. Should this person try to change their behavior in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And does the behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And could you tell me why or ...\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Because he's always late and that's not good. I mean, that's an indication ... that's a problem with ... that creates a ... god, I can't give you the words I want to use.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Like a life disturbance, maybe?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Well, it's opinions that people make about you based on your behavior and if you're late all the time, you're going to be looked on as a flake.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Okay. So yeah. Like a life disturbance type of thing, is [crosstalk 00:22:26].\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "A life disturbing, yeah. Because if he's applying for jobs or he's going to an interview or he has to be at work on time and you're late all the time, you're going to get fired. So when it causes life changing decisions, then you got a real problem. Like drinking. Like drinking.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. You think that because you have an issue with hoarding, that you would notice that? Or do you think that if you didn't have one, maybe you wouldn't be as cognizant of it as you are now?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I probably would not be as cognizant of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. You mentioned that you had gone up to the internet to find some information. Have you tried going anywhere else or other places that you heard of it, other than the TV?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No. Just, I've looked at websites and I've watched those TV shows and organization shows. I've read a couple organization books on how to get over the hoarding, but nothing's really helped. I guess it's helping, to the point where I know that I have an issue and I really want to do this, clean it out, get myself back on track.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "It happens. But the desire to go out and shop though, I've got to tell you, even during quarantine, it's very easy not to go. But I find myself thinking, I can't wait to go to Goodwill, or I can't wait to go look for that, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, no, of course. What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I think about myself. I think about my home, and how it looks piled with things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. Now I want to focus a little bit more on COVID impact. I know we talked a little bit about it. I want to talk about the specific behaviors that changed. You said that COVID has helped you a little bit, because you haven't been able to go out and get as much stuff.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "That is correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Has it impacted your difficulties with discarding?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "It may have made things easier for me to, because I'm looking at it constantly. I'm not running around. I'm looking at the stuff that I have and I have gradually started going through and for instance, I mentioned to you, the books. As soon as the local little church shop opened, I took a truckload of books to them. So yeah, in that way, in that I'm sitting here looking at it and thinking about it constantly, it has helped me get started going through some of it, and ridding myself of some of it. Does that makes sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah. How do you think it's affected your sense of connectedness and attachment? Do you think you've been seeing it more negative?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "You mean with family and friends?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, like family and friends as well. Or just your attachment to your items.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I think maybe it's helped me, because there's so much of it, I realize it's not important.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, finish.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Both. Yes. It gets in the way of my daily life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you describe a time where you believe your clutter got in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "There have been times I've wanted to have people over and felt like I couldn't because there's too much furniture in my dining room, for instance, or papers in my office. I can't think of anything ... If by the question, you mean is there something I wanted to buy but couldn't because of my clutter?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Or just something [crosstalk 00:19:44].\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Something I wanted [crosstalk 00:19:46]?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. It could be that or anything that got in the way of your life and something you really wanted to do or anything?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Yeah. You know, it feels like a domino effect a lot, that I may want to ... For instance, I want to paint the exterior of the house but before I do that I have to get rid of some of the things that are on the back patio or whatever it is but then to have that, I need to have a place for that to go or I need to have a weekend to be able to do it and so it never gets done and I don't get my house painted.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes. Has your clutter ever impacted your relationships? I know you've probably mentioned this before, either romantic, family, or your work relationships?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I don't think it's affected any relationships at work or romantic relationships but, currently, just with my daughter kind of recognizing it. I think sometimes I see her developing some of those habits but, hopefully, she's learning firsthand how to avoid it. I don't recall any impact it's had on our relationship.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes. Would you be upset if, say, you had to get rid of some of your items? Like ones that hold value to you?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "No. If I had someone that would help me do that and help me see how ... I think I can let go. It's just when I'm having that conversation with myself, I tend not to let go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. That makes sense. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder itself?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Can you read that question again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder itself?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I'm not sure. I think one of the things might be acquiring things that are completely unnecessary without knowing where you'll use it or how you will use it, where you will put it. That's kind of the acquisition of stuff but you were talking about saving things?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. Is there [crosstalk 00:23:43] ... Keep going. Sorry about that.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "There's a lot of it that I look at and I think, oh I wanted to do that with that, maybe I'll get around to that. Well I never do get around to these things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. You feel like you've had more time to organize and de-clutter, but you haven't taken advantage of it?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, all right. How has COVID impacted your overall physical health?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Well, part of it is the wildfires, I'm in California. Part of it is the wildfires. We have ash falling daily. The doctor advised do not go out and walk. I usually walk for a couple of miles a day. But I've been pretty much stuck in the house, especially the last month.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "With COVID, I live in a neighborhood where a lot of people walk. So I was going out very early in the morning to avoid a lot of people. Because a lot of people around here are not wearing masks. I was going out very early. Well then with the wildfires and all, I've kind of quit walking at all, and I feel very isolated now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, yeah, of course. This has affected your overall health, your mental health and wellbeing, you would say as well?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How has it affected you or your family financially?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Well, I'm retired, so it really hasn't affected me. My children are all able to work from home, so it hasn't affected them yet, totally.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, good, yeah. Are there any specific techniques in this era that you've found helpful?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No, I don't know. I don't know exactly how to answer that. I'm moving more to audiobook. I'm working in my yard more. I do have, luckily, a backyard that I can escape to where no one else is around.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that that brings you comfort more than your items, for example?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Actually, yes, it does.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good, yeah. You have something to do and put your hands on and stuff.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. Just the time to be able to focus on more serene things has helped. And I have done a few of the craft things that I wanted to do. But then, what stops me there is that I have to look for things through the piles, and that's another thing that's irritated me, that I really need to get rid of things so I can get to the stuff that I want. I don't know if that makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense. Would you say your motivation has stayed the same from before COVID to now, in terms of seeking help for hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I think it's gotten better. I think my motivation has increased.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, good.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I'm still not there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Part of working is getting up, getting dressed and going into work. And seeing other people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For sure.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "It's part of life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I agree.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "This is not living.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I mean, the psychological impact too is very tough for everybody.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "It is. It is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just not being able to see people.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I mean, hoarders are stuck with their hoarding. You're stuck at home with your ... but I've made trips to the dump and I've made trips to the ... I cook a lot when I go up there and then I have all this stuff I have to throw away, but I don't leave food around. I don't know if there's hoarders that do that. That's gross.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). For sure.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "But no. I'm not like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And-\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I just- go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sorry. Okay. I was just moving on to the next question but I wanted to ...\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What did you ... Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So how has COVID-19 affected your motivation to seek help for hoarding behaviors specifically?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "It's not one of my priorities.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Not one of my priorities, but since this came up now, I'll talk to you about it. But no. I'm not ... I don't have the money to go see a therapist and if I were, it wouldn't be about hoarding. It'd be about other things. So ... you know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. For sure. Have you kept in contact with your family and friends during this time?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How often?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Oh, a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, good.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I have a friend whose house I go over to during the week. And I go over there and work with her and talk, and then we go on hikes together.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wonderful.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And when I go up to my house I have a whole group of people I go hiking with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, that's great. Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah. And I have groups of people. We have Zoom. We have a Zoom meeting every couple weeks with all my running friends.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow. That's great.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And so there's a lot of ways that I try to stay healthy socially.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wonderful. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah. You have to move.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "You have to move the body every day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I think that's really important to your mental health. You got to get outside.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I agree completely.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sorry. Do you-\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "006\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... quiet. And we're recording. All right. First, I'm going to start with your demographics. What's your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I am a female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Female as well?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I'm sorry. I thought that was a question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Your race?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I am 72.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Your race?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Ethnicity? As in, do you identify as Hispanic and/or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Little bit of graduate work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Household income? You can just give me a range. You don't have to ...\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah, around 50 to 60,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Your geographic region? Such as northeast, south, west, Midwest.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I live in far west.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Far west, okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "As far as you can go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. As you know, this study's investigating individual's values and beliefs relating to hoarding disorders. First, I want to know what term you prefer when we're talking about difficulty with clutters and difficulty discarding. For example, some people like to address it as hoarding, other people say cluttering, other people say organizational problems. Do you have any term that you prefer?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No. I'm all of them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Whatever you like.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So I can use hoarding, and that'll be okay with you?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and more time for yourself, and fun? Yeah. Okay. Now, that's the first half, congrats, we did it. Now, the second half, first is going to be more of an introduction about behavior and treatment seeking. If you can please describe your hoarding and how long it's been going on.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Well I'm not sure. I've been thinking about this a lot. I probably had a tendency throughout my life to get things because I lacked so much for so long. But I didn't probably really start until maybe 20 years ago. I would say that I was in my mid 50's, my children moved out, left me completely alone. I was lonely, I was working two jobs and tired, and finally had some disposable income. I would start thrift shopping and grabbing things that I thought would make my life better. That's probably about where it started. It's probably been a good 20 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. How severe would you say this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "It's better now, because I reached the point where I am tired and want it done. I've been working on disposing of things, but I'm having a great deal of emotional trouble letting go.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Then, when you win something, it goes clink, clink, clink, and I would take anything that came out; I would put it in my right hand pocket, and when I got to the end of the five dollar roll of quarters, I had this urge to go into the pocket that had the things that came out and start spending that, and I said, \"No, that's stupid,\" even though it was something I could afford, but I just got that urge. I realized it's too easy to get hooked on that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "And what really concerns me is that, nowadays ... Years, what, six or seven years ago, I would walk one of these walks. It was an old timer's walk and it was held and registered in a casino that was closed in Saratoga Springs, New York, and we walked through it, and they were just like computers, and I don't even know how. There's no level to pull, so you didn't even have the satisfaction of the clinking and the action, and I guess you, what, put a credit card in and keep pressing a button? It feels so very, very dangerous. I truly don't know how to interact with the, all I can think is one-armed bandit because I can't remember the ... There's a specific term for them, but ones where they have different figures on the three ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The slot machines.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Slot machines. Yes! Thank you. Thank you. It just seems to me that's very dangerous, so to sit there just to push a button. At least when you pull down a level and you, physically, put the quarter in and you pull down the lever, you are aware of what you are doing. Yeah, no, but I can see how it can be an addicting kind of activity.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "So, I stay away from it because I'm an ex-smoker. I have an addictive personality, so I have to stay away from that kind of thing because I can see that it can become too enjoyable. Same with online shopping. You have to be hyper aware of what you're doing and why. I'm a salesperson. \"Whew, there's a sale. Let me go,\" and look at the sale. I'm just babbling. I'm sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, you're good. Basically, you've just been trying to really watch your shopping and your buying habits during COVID because it's really easy to online shop?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Exactly. Exactly, and I can get drawn in by a sale. We're having a sale and 30% off, whew. I have to tell me, \"You don't need that.\" \"You have a jacket for fall and a coat for winter. You don't need to go to the LL Bean sale and try to get some stuff.\" Yeah, I fall for the, \"get it before it's too late. Get it now while we still have supplies.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it's very tempting.\n",
      "007\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Before we actually start the interview, I just have some basic demographic questions. The first one is what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then what gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I'm sorry?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Oh, female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "White. Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then are you Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And then what is your highest degree or level or school you've completed?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Master's degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then what is your household income, and it can be in a range. I don't need an exact.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Somewhere around $25,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then, which geographic region best describes where you live in the US? Northeast-\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Northeast.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right. Okay. As you know, this study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question would be what term you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "What term I prefer?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I don't prefer any of them because I hate the whole thing, so I dislike hoarding. The term, \"hoarding,\" I'll put it that way. I don't know what terms you have available, but sufferer, I guess, would be it. Hoarder is...I know I'm a hoarder, so I hate that term anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so you want me to say, \"difficulties with clutter?\"\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yes. That would-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, that's fine. Most of these topics we usually touch on a little bit more later in the interview, so we can always come back to them. Okay, this next part, I like to call it more conversational style. We're just going to be talking about your clutter problems and how you feel about them, and how your family feels about them.\n",
      "For this first one, can you please describe how long your difficulties with clutter has been going on?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Probably most of my life. My mother was extremely, a neat and tidy woman, and my bedroom was the bane of her existence, unfortunately, and it has not improved, and I've never really been in a situation where I've been forced to come to terms with it. Yeah, I'd say all my life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and how severe would you say your behavior is right now?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Right now, it's quite severe.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Have you ever sought to change this behavior? Have you gone for professional help?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I didn't know there was professional help for cluttering. When I was moving in 2010, I paid someone to come in and help me, and she was very good because she would say, \"Oh, when's the last time you used this?\" And I'd say, [inaudible 00:10:09], y'know. \"Two years ago? You don't need this.\" That's what I needed, is somebody to do that for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. So next question is, what do you think the most precious item in your house is?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Oh god. My bird. My live bird. I mean, my precious ... because all the fires we've had here in the Bay Area. I've watched people and they left their pets behind. I freaked out. It's like, how can you leave your pets?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I know.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Probably because they were at work or something and they told them to evacuate and couldn't get back. But my pets and then pictures, I guess photographs, I'd probably grab a box of photographs of my mom and dad who are dead and something like that. That's all I can think of. I mean, I have insurance so all of this stuff can be replaced.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. Thank you. Do you think you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Let me see here. Okay. If you had to choose between any of your items, we kind of talked about this, how would you choose a certain item over the other one?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Well, whether I used it or not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Whether I used it or whether I intended to use it which is why I've got so much stuff it's just like well, I can use that. But see, I lost my job. This has nothing to do, but I lost my job through this COVID thing and I'm trying to find another job and the last thing I want to do right now is clean. Now other people, they're baking, they're doing gardening. No. I'm kind of more focused on finding a job. Once I know I've got a job, I can relax and the rest of my life fall into place. But I've had some difficult times as I've gotten older and it depresses me. When I'm depressed, that's the last thing I want to do is clean. There's no way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand. Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative). All right. Let me see here. Does your behavior upset you in any way? Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah. I mean, when it gets in the way ... I mean, when it gets in the way I clean it up. And I have it situated so that it isn't in my way. But for instance I'll give you an example. I take The New Yorker. Okay, that's a weekly magazine. There is absolutely no way you can get through it in a week. And it piles up and piles up and everybody who takes The New Yorker knows that. If the subscription is just and I'm sitting here, I haven't even read half of them. They're all over place. And it's like I've done this before and it's like I don't read them but I really want to read them because it's the best read stuff. So that's something that I've got all over my house. New Yorkers, everywhere.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah, I'm the classic person who falls for that, so I try not to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Also, during quarantine and COVID, how has your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items, has it increased? Do you feel like your items are more important to have around?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "No, actually, I'm more testy with them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I'm less attached to them. I just need to get myself together to get rid of things and I have a paper shredder. Shred papers that need to be shredded, because I'm one of these people, \"Oh, I can't just put that in recycling. I have to shred it.\" So, I have a pile of papers on top of my shredder because I haven't shredded the papers yet. See, I make plans. I do have plans and then I have things like I belong to a group called, \"Buy Nothing.\" There are a number of these groups throughout the country. It's B-U-Y, Buy Nothing, and it's hyper local. So, the one I'm in is just more... all things to work in it. It's before the City Hall was [crosstalk 00:38:48].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I get on because if they're looking for something I have and can put my hands on. There's no question there, but if they're looking for something that I have, then it's a way to get it out of my place and into the hands of someone who could use it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "So, that's something. Then, there's a group that they ... It's a local group, and instead of selling things in a store front to people, they give things away, and I really like that, like clothing and things that people who have nothing can go in and get. Clothes, books, and household items, and that sort of thing.\n",
      "So, the problem is, of course, getting myself together, get things folded, and then to bag, and then I look for something [inaudible 00:39:53]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "It might lose weight if people hear this shit. I'm really getting into this. [crosstalk 00:40:01] I'm awful. I'm probably everything rolled into one, all the bad habits. Hoarders and clutterers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What I'm getting from is it seems that COVID has happened, you feel less attached to everything and you're more inclined to sort your items. You just haven't gotten to sorting and organizing and getting rid of things yet?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "This is, maybe, thinking back a little bit on your life. Did your clutter behaviors ever affect your work?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "No. No, I don't think it ever affected my work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "No, not my work. My home life and, now, since I live alone, I am very, yeah. I went from a two bedroom [hell 00:41:12] house to a small place filled with things to get rid of. All the stuff I should've gotten rid of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you found yourself buying more things during COVID?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "No. A couple of things, like with new hobbies. If I was doing a lot of baking, I might buy a couple of baking tools. But, in general, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Would you say COVID has made you more ... I'm not sure how to phrase it. Like more urgent to throw away things [crosstalk 00:39:58].\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "More aware.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "More aware? Okay.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Yeah. More aware of the issues and I'm starting to go through my closet and getting rid of things if I haven't worn them in a long time or they don't look great on.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Has COVID affected your sense of attachment to your items and the value to your items in any way?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I think it is starting to cause me to eliminate that from my brain, try not to think about how much did you pay for that? Yeah. I think that I have taken much more to the Goodwill ... I should say, I have taken more valuable things to a charity organization than I have in the past.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. That makes sense. Has COVID impacted your overall physical or mental health in any way or just your physical wellbeing, your mental wellbeing?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "It has impacted it in a very positive way. I started doing yoga and I have been exercising and walking and I've lost 35 pounds since COVID started. It's been a very positive change for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has COVID affected you or your family financially? Either negatively or positively.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "No. Luckily, it has not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How have you been coping since COVID? I hear you say that you may have got new hobbies or anything but, overall, again how have you been coping since COVID?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Are you asking what do I do to cope with it? Am I coping with it successfully?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I guess both. What have you been doing and then has that been successful for you?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Okay. I've been doing yoga daily and trying to meditate. I, from the get go, established a bubble with two other people, another couple in our neighborhood, some friends of mine. My daughter and I and the two of them we kept our households as one and we cooked together a lot and it wasn't just me alone, thank goodness, or it wasn't just me and my daughter. We had this outlet of two other people. We kept a social network going that way, which I think helped tremendously to get through some of those worst times.\n",
      "As it drags on and on, it's beginning to wear on me. I used to hike all the time. Of course, now, I live in southern California so our mountains are on fire. I can't hike right now. You know, I do what I can to be outside, and not cooped up, a couple times a day.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yes. I'll tell you. My sister-in-law and I started in January planning a trip to Italy. So in March we were planning on going in March and boom. COVID hit. So then it was this huge ordeal. We were going to go to several countries and I don't get along with her very well, so we were going to try and do this to mend our relationship or to bond closer. Well, I had no idea what she was like and she turned into a total ass. And ended up just being horrible. It was one of the most horrible experiences. So from January through April or right before my birthday in May, she was hounding me and we had replanned the trip three different times because as time went on, you could see COVID was going on. So we kept having to rebook and rebook and oh my god. It was horrible.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And I basically, I'm cut off from my brother because she's planning with my brother and I'm cut off with her. So it created a huge rift ... which causes me the stress and I'm depressed about it. Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. It must be tough for you.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "It was horrible.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah? Me too.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. Well, actually that's all the questions I have for you as far as the interview.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Way more information-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "... than you needed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. No. It was great. Thank you for all of the information. So for the next part I just need some demographic, study demographics.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So could you please tell me your gender identity.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah. Female and straight.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Perfect. And then sex assigned at birth.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Perfect.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I can't believe we have to ask these questions now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Geez. I'm a blend. Sorry. Sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about your race?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "White? Okay. And ethnicity?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "American. I don't know. What do you call it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Perfect. That's perfect. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And household income. You can give me a range if you're not comfortable with giving me the exact.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I'm in the six figure range. Was.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right. Perfect.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Was.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. So geographic region. So like Northwest, South, West...\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I'm in Northern California.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Perfect. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "San Francisco Bay Area.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. And highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I have a law degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "This one wasn't as involved. I had this really interesting telephone conversation with somebody and it got into drinking which we didn't get into. They're trying to make ... because I'm curious. Is there a connection that you guys see with people who have come from alcoholic families that have hoarding disorders?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, for sure. Okay, I think that's all the questions that I have for you today, as far as the interview. This next part, I just was going to ask you some demographic information so that I can send you the 30 dollar card for participating. First, I would need to ask you for your gender identity.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I'm male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and sex assigned a birth?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and your race?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "White, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Ethnicity, do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and household income? You can give me a range, it doesn't have to be exact.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "My mom's a nurse, I'm not really sure what she makes. I'm only making about 12 bucks an hour right now, so it's hard to say.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's good, thank you. What geographic location are you're in, North, North-east, South, Midwest?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Phoenix, so South-west.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "College degree, bachelor's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so the demographic information was for the study. I'm going to ask you for payment information now, so your first... This we'll keep-\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "001\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Here we go. So as you know, this study is investigating individual attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question I have for you is what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "What term?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Is there a term you prefer?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Clutter.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Clutter. Not hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. Perfect.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. All right. Perfect. Thank you. All right. So we're done with the lists. And so the next part is just I'm going to ask you some questions and again, if you're uncomfortable with any of the questions, just let me know. You do not need to answer them. Okay?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. So could you please describe your clutter problems? How long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Oh my gosh. A long time. I mean, I get lots and lots of mail. I try and go through it and throw things away. I'd say over 20 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Mm-hmm (affirmative). How severe would you say this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Mildly. Moderately severe. Moderately. Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And do you think this behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Well, yeah. Kind of. Because that's why I'm participating in the study because I'd like to get tips on how to stop doing this. You ever heard of somebody called the FlyLady?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I have not.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Oh you haven't? She's a person that deals with clutter. People... Yeah. The FlyLady. And there's a website. And people go to her. And it's basically based on little steps type of thing where you make little steps. People who have been depressed for a long period of time. People who have gone through a death. People who have gone through bad times in their life that that's the last thing they want to do is clean their house and clean up the clutter. So-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. Have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you gone to a professional or [crosstalk 00:05:24]-\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And all right. Perfect. Thank you. That's good. How do your friends and family feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "They don't know about it because I don't have them over. I mean, my husband and our house, he deals with it. He just deals with it. But my house is kind of unfinished because I have clutter all over the place because I go between two different places where I'm never in the same place long enough. I don't live in one spot. I live in a couple of spots.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Are there areas of your home that you would consider cluttered? What makes them cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Yes. My office is cluttered because of papers and too much stuff. It kind of looks organized sometimes because I've got things in boxes and labeled boxes. You know, it would just be great if I didn't have them and I don't really think I need them all. My dining room, my prior house I had a whole different style of house so I have my dining room is filled with all of the old furniture that I need to sell still as well as my dining room furniture that I have now and that's true in several rooms.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Yeah. That's probably the best description.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there parts of your home that you don't use or are they all inaccessible?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "My garage, I can't ... but all the rooms inside the house are accessible.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What kind of things do you think your garage is filled with? What's the main thing you think?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Boxes of stuff from my old house that have been in storage for two and a half years. I haven't even seen them to know what's in there. But I'm tired of paying storage and we just moved all the boxes into the garage.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "We're slowly going through them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. My next question is when you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable to you?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Multiple things. I mean, there's some because they're irreplaceable, pieces of art, for instance. Some are because of who they used to belong to, my mom, my dad, things that my ... Memories, things that my kids have made. Photographs are valuable to me. Then there's monetary value, jewelry and some artwork is valuable, specifically, because it's financial value.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. What would you say is the most precious item in your house?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Photo albums. Actually, they're not in my house right now because we had to evacuate. Now they're in my office. But my photo albums.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, okay. When it comes to throwing something away, what is trash for you? What do you usually discard?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Such a general question. I have recently been getting rid of a lot of clothing. What do I discard? Stuff that I don't think I will ever need.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. If you had to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Well, that's kind of what we just went through in deciding what to actually [inaudible 00:17:57]. Those things that I felt ... A photograph wasn't going to be enough and that were truly just irreplaceable. Photo albums, for instance. You know, the actual photo albums that aren't digital. Some of the artwork and important papers, passports and things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Does your clutter upset you in any way or do you think it's getting in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, all right. Next question, please describe where you live now, do you live alone?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Right now I'm living with my parents, because I didn't have a job for a few years and my health went down hill. But I'm working again, but my health's still a mess, and my current job doesn't pay as much, so I'm waiting to get to where I can earn enough to move out on my own again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and are there parts of your home that you consider cluttered? What makes them cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "My room is a disaster area, the rest of the house is... My parents control it, so when I was living by myself the whole place was cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there parts of your room that you don't use because of the clutter?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Well, I mean, instead of putting my laundry away, I just put a basket on the floor, and I use it. Then I put the dirty stuff in my laundry bag, and keep the clean stuff in the laundry basket when I could just put it in the dresser, and so that's an example. I have a bunch of cables and things from things that are plugged in, the cables could be organized better. A lot of different boxes and things that need to be cleaned out and put in the closet, a lot of papers and files. I have a hard time with filing things, so I always have papers everywhere.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, all right, perfect, thank you. Let me see, next question, when you think of your possessions, what makes them valuable? How do you determine if an object has value or not?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "For me if it's anything that... I collect books and things that are like, and anything relating to Star Wars, or whatever. But also, I'll save anything that I've ever written, like all my school stuff, so those I all value. Because of my health, I've been learning to that I have to save all my medical records. I've got lots of DVDs, Blu-ray discs [crosstalk 00:14:48].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would be trash for you? What do you think?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Let's see...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do you know it's time to throw something away?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Well, for me, if its wrappers or if its... I'm trying to think of the word. When I recycle, I recycle junk mail, I recycle boxes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that recyclables are something...\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I throw food away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Throw food away, okay.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I eat food but I don't waste food, but I mean scraps or whatever. I don't really have a garbage bin in my room, I have a recycling bin in my room, because our garbage bin we have is in the kitchen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's a very interesting connection that I haven't looked into yet.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And that's what they were ... and I see a connection because I do have ... I think it affected me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, wow. Okay. Well, yeah. That's something very interesting we need to definitely look into. And thank you so much.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "You should look into that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Thank you so much for your time and all the information. Very, very helpful. I really appreciate it.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Sure. Is there going to be any follow-up or is this it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We'll make sure that they will send your gift card to you. That'll be the follow-up. If you have any questions at all you can always e-mail Interviewer Henderson. She's the one that's been e-mailing you.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Right. Right. But I'm happy to continue participating if you guys have more stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh yeah. Of course. I'll let-\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I'd like to get to the bottom of this and help myself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You're also helping others too when you do these type of things. So yeah. It's amazing.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "But I would, if I were you, look into the alcohol connection.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Of course.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Because she was asking me questions like that and then I asked her, \"Well, what do you think?\" And she said, \"Well, we seem to see a pattern in people who have had alcohol problems\", which I have had, and families that have alcohol problems.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is very, very interesting stuff. For sure. I'll definitely see what that is. And I will let Interviewer know that you're interested in participating in more future studies as well.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Thank you so much. You have a wonderful day. Good luck with your interviews.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "You too. Take care.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",

      "Bye.\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. Do you think that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "My behavior in keeping it is a problem. I'm not shopping anymore. Of course part of this is the pandemic helped, because I'm not running out to thrift shops and garage sales and estate sales. That's kind of helped me stop and really think about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. Have you ever sought to change this behavior? Or have you ever gone to a professional for help?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No I haven't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Have you ever tried to change it or tried to find help in other places?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I haven't sought help, other than seeking information on internet, watching the hoarding TV shows to try to realize how other people work through it and try to get myself motivated.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Right. How does your family and friends feel about your behavior? Have you ever had any conflict with them?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Not really. Except that one of my sons, I have two sons. One is much more relaxed about things. But I have one that's very much like my mother, everything has to be neat and tidy in his life, and he works constantly. He can't seem to stop tidying up and cleaning and organizing. So coming to my house is uncomfortable for him. That's my biggest issue.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. All right. That's it for the first section. We can move onto the second one, which is space and living area. Please describe where you live now, and do you live alone? What's the space like?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I live alone in a single family home with three bedrooms, two dogs, kind of a little storage porch and garage. Anything else?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. What would you want your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I would want it to be easy to navigate and I would like to, when I go into a room, not see something that I need to take care of. I would just like to, yeah, have everything have a place and be able to just do my normal cleaning without having to move things around.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. Then there's parts of your home that you would consider cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Yes. Yeah. It is. It's similar to the previous one. It was something particular that is not just, for instance, your mail becomes [inaudible 00:35:05]. It's scattered around the house. This is something he is saving for possible use in the future and that seems more of the mentality of a hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. This last scenario I'm going to go ahead and read this one. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room and before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Again, in this scenario, do you believe this is more of a clutter problem or something more serious?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I would say it's more than just clutter again because it's acquiring things that don't necessarily have a purpose in the house and just acquiring so many of them that it's interfering with his daily life. I would say it's more on the hoarding side.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For this scenario, do you believe this behavior is similar or different to your own behavior?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "There are some similarities, not at that extreme, and I don't ... There isn't one particular thing that I go out and acquire for a collection of, like, antiques. I will purchase things that are kind of '50s era, even if I don't have a place for display or I have too many things to display. Sometimes something gets into my mindset that, \"Oh, this would look fabulous in my house\" but there really isn't ... I don't need anything more like that. There are some similarities.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Thank you. That was the third part of the Interviewer. This last part of the Interviewer is actually about COVID and its impacts. Once again, I will be asking you some questions and if you need any clarification or feel uncomfortable answering a question, just let me know.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How has COVID impacted your life? What specific behaviors have changed for you?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "To some extent, I am purging but not enough but I'm starting. That's a good thing. Especially since I am in my house so much that I kind of see it. Also, the fact that I occupy my office and I have so many things going on in my office at once, to some extent, it's messier than it was pre-COVID. It's had a multiple impact on me in different ways.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I was going to ask what you thought would have been progress for you, or baby steps?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Well, I think I made progress with the books. I am trying to go through the sewing room, and cleaning out stuff. But every time I look at something, I think I can use that. I really need to just decide, I could replace this if I needed to, so it's okay to let it go now to someone who could use it. I just have a hard time. I know logically what should be done, but emotionally, it's very, very difficult for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's a good answer. Yeah. Part of throwing things away is that they won't be able to be used anymore, and that'll just be the end of the item's life cycle.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you would rather give them away to someone where it can still continue to get used?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Thrift stores and places like that, would that make you feel better if you gave your stuff away to thrift stores instead of throwing it away?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, good. Back to the vignette, do you think that the person's behavior is similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Similar.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Similar? Okay. In what ways?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Well you mentioned antiques in this vignette. I do have some things that are, like I said, I have a lot of collections that I kind of treasure. But I know that to somebody else they're probably valueless. Although, I also know there are other people like me that might want them. I just know that, I guess they're providing emotional support to me in some way, or I wouldn't bother with them. Because I have friends who have no difficulty when something's been used and they're done with it, they just toss it. Even though I see value in it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "They don't have any trouble letting go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I do, and I don't understand that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. You would definitely say that it's more emotional?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay good. So you can recognize when something has reached the end of its use and you still wouldn't want to throw it away?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "That is correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know you mentioned that you wanted to get sewing back again. What if it was a sewing machine that had broken, and it was beyond repair? Would you be willing to throw that away? Or do you think that you would still try to get some use out of it?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah, I would pass it along.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So, what does your space look like? Are you able to use every room for its intended purpose or are there some rooms you just can't use at all?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "No, I sit in my living room and sleep in my bedroom, and cook in my kitchen. Use the bathroom. So, those are the rooms that I have. My table is not, I'd love to have it cleaned off and do jigsaw puzzles because I don't sit down at the table and eat. It has my printer on it, and then I have to clean off space so the printer can be used on the rare occasion that I use it. I mean there's just stuff everywhere and it drives me nuts.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, would you consider every part of your home to be cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And is it things in boxes that's making them cluttered or is it just furniture or books or puzzles?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Not really furniture so much. It's more stuff on the furniture.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Stuff. It's just stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's just a collection of miscellaneous items?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Calling it a collection is a very generous description.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Okay, on the flip side, what would you like your home to look like in an ideal world?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Oh, I would love it to be neat and tidy, and be able to open the door and invite anyone in instead of having to move stuff off the couch, so that somebody could sit on it. That I'd be able to say, \"Oh, come in. Have a seat.\" I would love to have that. Absolutely love to have it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and how important is it for to feel at home? How important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "How important are my things...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "For me to feel at home?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I have no idea how to answer that because there are some thing that if somebody came in and then got rid of them on my behalf, I'd be very grateful and other things, I'd say, \"Whew, I don't really want to get rid of that,\" and there's also things where I go, \"Oh, I forgot I had that.\" \"Oh, look at this.\" When you get to the bottom of a pile, it's like your compass on a mission of discovery. Whoo-hoo!\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, when you think about all your items, which would you say are most important for you and you spend the most time with?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I spend the most time with my laptop, actually.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah, that's the biggie for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But after that, do you, maybe, read a lot? I know you mentioned you like puzzles, do you have a large collection of puzzles?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I do have a lot of puzzles. The problem with reading is I had cataract surgery and lenses replaced. I'm extremely near-sighted, but I never had trouble reading. Now, I have trouble sitting down and reading. They were not able to correct my stigmatism, so even with correcting reading glasses, it's uncomfortable for me to read, and that drives me nuts. That is just a heartbreak for me because I used to read incessantly. I was an avid reader and, now, it's uncomfortable and it's not a wonderful thing, and that breaks my heart most of all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I'm very hard to hear that. That sounds like its been very difficult for you. So, then, you're mostly just using your computers and puzzles, you'd say?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yes, I would say so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Again, when you think about all your possessions, what makes them valuable? How do you determine when an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I guess sentimentality is one and then, it's like finding a plan, I know the whole idea of taking a picture of something and then you can preserve it, but then I have to think, well I take a picture of it, and then I have to identify it. Then I have to take the picture and then I take things to snap this, which is one of the... you can make photo books and things. So, I have all of these plans. \"Oh, I'm going to do that,\" so my kids and my grandkids can look back on family history and see all of this. Then I just don't click because it has to be perfect.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "It has to be just right and if I can't get it just right, then I get frustrated and I stop, because it isn't perfect.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "One way you value objects is based on their memory associated or the sentimentality of that object?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yes. Sentimentality and perceived usability, either immediate or possible future use of the living, which is where I really get into trouble. [crosstalk 00:20:24] How can you be of use some day and, then, some day comes and you either forget you have it or you can't find it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. We just have one left. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows their valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he finds them or forgets what he's looking for. He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and, sometimes, he does not show up at all.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "He, obviously, has a disorder as well. That would be obsessive compulsive, wouldn't it? Where he has to have antiques since he's buying new antiques?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, he could be a compulsive shopper. It would be hard to say it's OCD just from this one description, but it is possible.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah. That's certainly very extreme and I'm, again, grateful. You're making me feel better about myself. Yeah, I can't relate this to that. I can relate to this thought of the antique thing, but I don't really have any valuable antiques. I have some things that have been in my mother's family, like my kitchen table from the farmhouse where she grew up, but I don't think there would be any value as far as selling it to antique dealers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. No, that's understandable. Okay. I think that we've covered everything. I'm just really quickly looking over all my questions just to make sure. Okay. I'm going to stop recording now.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Then the next vignette is, John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they're valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "So again, does this person's behavior seem more like hoarding disorder, or is it more like clutter problems, and why?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "That definitely [inaudible 00:22:35] it doesn't sound [inaudible 00:22:47] so it's probably disordered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Should this person try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:23:04] probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And does this behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And is this behavior similar or different to your own, and why?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "It sounds different. [inaudible 00:23:32].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so the last part of this interview is about COVID-19. Again, I'll be asking you questions, please let me know if you need any clarification or are uncomfortable answering any of the questions.\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. So how has COVID-19 impacted your life?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I used to go down to the [inaudible 00:23:54] two or three times a week [inaudible 00:24:05].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Have any specific behaviors changed?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Probably. (silence) not really, no. [inaudible 00:24:29] more time with... I guess some different times [inaudible 00:24:36] on Facebook. I'm not [inaudible 00:24:41].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How has COVID-19 affected your acquiring habits such as buying things or acquiring free things?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I don't really buy [inaudible 00:24:50] get loads of free stuff, I do get [inaudible 00:24:50] actual stuff that takes up space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And has COVID-19 affected your difficulties with throwing away things?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:25:28] yeah, sometimes [inaudible 00:25:46] in a day and [inaudible 00:25:46] so kind of I guess, it's kind of helped. More packaging [inaudible 00:25:49].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. And how has it affected problems with clutter?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "It's really about the same. [inaudible 00:26:05] too many boxes to [inaudible 00:26:08].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And has COVID-19 affected your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And have you had more time to organize or declutter your space?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I've had more time but I haven't used it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And then how has COVID-19 impacted your overall physical health?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I don't know if anything's changed all that much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And has it affected your overall mental health or wellbeing?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right, all right. She didn't keep them anywhere?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Right, she did not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Caused a lot of trouble.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. Good. I have one more vignette to go through. It's about value and things that are valuable. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. Okay. Do you think this person has hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Not sure if it's hoarding or just organization.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I'm very like that, with things that I think are valuable, and I don't want to just get rid of them because they might have some value. Either to me or to someone else later.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "But I find a lot of times, when I want to get rid of things I think, well I can at least try to have a yard sale, because this is actually a valuable item, even though it no longer is to me or to my children, I still know that it has a monetary value. So it's difficult to let go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. With that kind of item, would you be willing to sell it? Or would you be willing to give it away in some kind of yard sale?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "If I knew it was going to someone that would appreciate it, I would be willing to give it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Good. How do you think your family would feel? If they heard you say ... Do you consider that some kind of progress? That you could give it away if you knew it was going to a home where it was going to be appreciated?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah, probably. They would think it was progress for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you consider that progress for you? If you were able to do that?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You don't sound too convinced.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I'm not. I'm really struggling with this. I have so much that I enjoy, even though I know it's useless to someone else. I don't know. It's very difficult to decide. Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. Okay. So could you please describe where you live now? What's the space like?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Well, my space is very small. It's a room with a bathroom and I share a house with ... well, I don't share a house. I just have a room with a bathroom and I have my little refrigerator in the bathroom. I have no place to cook. And so when I buy groceries I have to buy mostly takeout when I'm down here but this is my place in the city so that I can work, but now with COVID it's become crazy because the libraries are closed. This is just a place for me to sleep. It's got all my work clothes. It's got all the stuff I need for work. Stuff to get ready for work. It's got a TV in my Keurig and all my stuff. And stuff I use all the time. Then at my house up in the foothills has my long-term stuff and my furniture and everything else. And it's all my cooking and it's a full home, so I go back and forth between the two.\n",
      "This is basically I use it just to sleep and now with COVID it's horrible because they've closed every place else where I can go to work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I know. It's definitely horrible.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I had this specifically as a place to sleep when I go to work in the Bay Area.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. Let's see. Are there parts of your home that you consider cluttered in your view and what makes them cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "My living room. My table. My dining room table is full of stuff. And the stuff ... when I get up there, I open my computer and I lay out my mail and there's mail and there's stuff on the floor. And I get through stuff and then I cook and I put everything away. It's not like I just leave ... I'm not one of these really cluttered people where you can't walk around. So not like that. I'm not like that. But I do have piles that I'm concerned about because I just don't do anything with that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "So yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Let me see here. Okay. When do you think about ... oh, sorry. I'm lost. When you think about your possessions, there we go, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Oh what makes them valuable?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No? I know you were working from home, but has COVID-19 affected you or your family financially?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I think they're about the same. If anything they're [inaudible 00:27:13].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. All right. And how have you been coping since COVID-19 started?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:27:21] if anything I'm [inaudible 00:27:47].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Any specific techniques you've found helpful in coping with the loss?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:28:01].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Where do you seek comfort? Do you seek it from others, your items or somewhere else?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I'm not sure, [inaudible 00:28:36].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Have you sought treatment, resources or some kind of professional support during COVID-19?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Just occasional visits with my physician.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And has COVID-19 affected your motivation to seek help for hoarding behavior specifically?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "No. [inaudible 00:29:02] it's hurting [inaudible 00:29:07].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Has the person you are living with changed during COVID-19?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Not [inaudible 00:29:23], no. [inaudible 00:29:24].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And have you been keeping in contact with family and friends during this time?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Yeah, a little bit less than we used to, [inaudible 00:29:47].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And how often do you interact with them, whether it's phone calls or in person?\n",

      "Participant  004:\n",
      "As an adult, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And has COVID-19 affected your sense of isolation or loneliness?\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, great. So next I just need some demographic information so we can send you the $30 gift card for participating.\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what is your gender identity?\n",

      "Male.\n",

      "Participant  004:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. Okay. What is your estimated household income?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I'd say it's around 150,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What is your geographic region in the US? Is it Northeast, Southwest or Midwest?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I guess south.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And what is your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Bachelor's degree, I've got a professional certification, [inaudible 00:32:00] took a course there, [inaudible 00:00:32:11].\n",

      "Yes. Yes. And then the next information is for the gift card. So can you please spell your first and last name?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. And lastly, do you have a preference for a physical or electronic gift card?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "What kind of giftcard is it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm not sure.\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Okay. Digital is probably fine.\n",

      "Yeah, physical.\n",

      "The fact that I'm going to use them again. I mean, there's some left-in valuable memories, memories that are attached to them. And sometimes clothes that I can't wear anymore, I won't give them away just because they've got memories attached to them. Or I think maybe someday I'm going to wear them. But I have two full closets full of clothes. I've given some stuff away. I give stuff away all the time to Goodwill, but I still have tons of stuff. I have more stuff that I could ever use.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And so what do you think is trash for you? What would you discard?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I clean my bird cage every day and discard the papers under the cage. I throw away bottles after I use them. We recycle things down here, so I get rid of stuff all the time. Everyday I throw out bottles that I use. Newspaper. But I usually recycle the newspaper and use it. Food and discarded food. And then I throw things away after they're just beat up. I throw away purses. I throw away clothes when they're worn out. And a lot of times I'm given things as gifts that I hold onto out of probably more ... what's the word I want to use? I feel bad because I don't like them, but I hold onto them, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "But I shouldn't do that. I should just get rid of them. I wish I was a better ... just go through and just say, \"I haven't worn this anymore. Get rid of it.\" But I mean there are things that I've made. I took tailoring and I made coats that I know I'll never wear them again but I worked on my ass off on them, right? So they're still in my closet. So things that I've worked really hard on that mean something even though I don't wear them, they're there to bring a memory to me about something because as I get older, my memory is bad and sometimes I need tangible objects. I'm more of a spacial person.\n",
      "And so the way I work well if I have papers laid all out and I look at them and when I'm interviewing on the phone, I have my resume and I've got bios on the people that I'm working on and I've got something hold up or I'm looking online to see if they've written something that would be interesting in the conversation. I just pull. I pull from a lot of different things. That's kind of the way I operate.\n",

      "No. There's no full rooms that are like dangerous [inaudible 00:09:54].\n",

      "Okay. I know you mentioned your TV. Is there anything that's the most precious item for you in your house?\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",

      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. If you had to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Generally speaking it's utility I guess. How much use I can get out of it. How long it's going to last. How much space I can save [inaudible 00:12:38] versus [inaudible 00:12:41].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",

      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Well, one of the problems with throwing away things is I really believe, strongly, in recycling and reusing, so it's very difficult for me to just throw something away. In fact, I have a broken scale that used a nine volt battery, but the battery, I mean, it's years old and the battery had rusted onto the gizmo that the nine volt battery hooks into. It has the two round things on the end that snap. So, it's unusable. You can't get a weight without the battery and the battery is rusted onto the ends of it, and I checked with the local head. You can't recycle things like scales or a coffee pot that doesn't work anymore.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "You have to throw them away and I haven't been able to do that because I just think there should be something better to do with it. It's very strange.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "You'll be dealing with a lot of strange people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When it comes to discarding, you have difficulties throwing something away because you really believe in recycling and when you don't find the right place, you just hold onto it for when something will change?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah, probably, or just ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A guilt thing?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "One of the problems, as I said, I have something called spinal stenosis, which I didn't know till late last year, and it has impacted my ability to walk and to stand, and when you are sorting things and going through things, you have to be just, generally, standing up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "So, about 10 minutes is my limit for standing up and instead of saying, \"Okay, I'll take a break for 20 minutes and come back to it,\" I'll do 10 minutes and stop. That's an issue that I have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, sounds like it would be very difficult. You mentioned that you do think you have too much stuff and that you know that you need to be getting rid of some things, but what would you consider your most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Probably the photographs and there's a box of photographs. Then, I have a vase that my daughter made for me. Sentimental things. There's an ornament from kind of close to where I grew up that a relative was involved in, starting a Christmas Eve choir of men that go around and sing. They still do it. 170 years later, they're still going around the town and singing the Christmas carols on Christmas Eve. They start at midnight and go all night. I have an ornament from that. So, that is something that I want my children and grandchildren to appreciate. I guess it's things that I would want my family to, maybe appreciate is the wrong word. Maybe that's my problem, is a I appreciate it too much.\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Well, I mean, the first thing that comes to mind is situations like the show Hoarders, where it's the extreme. Then I had people on my dad's side, his siblings, some of them were real hoarders, and that on more of the extreme side, they'd have sheds and sheds of stuff. It was a mess and when a couple of them passed away. We had to just sort through some stuff. But I also have understood, just from my own personal living experiences, that it's not always that extreme. You can go through life having... to where it still affects your social life, and your mental well-being, just because you have trouble getting rid of things. You collect things, but you're not... from head to toe, every inch of your house is covered, but it still affects you and your house is still a mess.\n",

      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "First one, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something, or decides to move. When the items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in, he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized, but not usually cluttered. Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend a couple of minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them, when this happens he's rarely late in getting where he needs to be. Okay, so does the person depicted in this story have hoarding disorder, or is it more like clutter problems in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I wouldn't say so much hoarding. I mean, he does have some clutter issues, I've been known to do similar things with keeping boxes in case I need them later, or having trouble locating keys, and things like that. But the way you described it, it's more like he's just keeping boxes and his place is a little messy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I mean, he could maybe organize his things a little better maybe, and not worry about the boxes as much. I've learned from own experience that when you move you can go to home depot and get boxes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'll read this first one. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized, but it is usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he, eventually, finds them. When this happens, he's real late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Would you say that this hoarding disorder or is it more clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "He doesn't sound like a clutterer.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I can understand the urge to keep boxes. You always need boxes. People on this \"Buy Nothing\" group are always looking for boxes because there's people moving. No, I don't think he has a hoarding disorder at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I mean, he has one item that he keeps neatly in a closet. Doesn't sound like there's much ... Show me someone who has never lost anything and I will show you an infant of about three days old, because you put something down in a place you don't normally put it, I think everyone goes ... I would hope. I would imagine everyone has done that at some point or another.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Definitely not a hoarding situation, in my opinion.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then how would you say this ... Is it similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "It's different because I don't just have one closet with my stuff in it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I have a closet that's pretty neat. I'm the exact opposite.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right, we're going to move on to the next one then. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He's worried that he might get rid of a box and he will need it later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for him to walk in his house. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and, sometimes, doesn't show up at all.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Oh, that's definitely not clutter. It's hoarder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. The first scenario is that John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When the items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy in one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized but is usually not cluttered. Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "In this scenario, do you think John Doe could potentially have hoarding disorder? Is this a behavior similar to having clutter problems? Why?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I would say the fact that he is saving all sorts of boxes and all sorts of sizes, just in case, and I think you described it as he doesn't want to throw away something that he might need in the future, that signals to me some amount of ... I'm not sure if it's hoarding or clutter. I would say the hoarding mentality, losing your keys and finding ... I don't see that as ... Everyone does that. It would just be that whole thought of, \"I can't throw away this box because if I did, if I need it in the future, what would happen.\" That's the part that kind of signals to me that, yes, he has a bit of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Do you think that John Doe should change his behavior or seek treatment for anything?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "That's a question so personal for the actual person. It sounds like he needs treatment, intervention but maybe some tools to be able to separate from you can find boxes elsewhere when you need one. You're taking up an entire closet for that one potential need. To help him just get through that would probably benefit him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the next question is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "No. I mean, maybe ... you know what upsets me is when I lose something. I cannot stand it when I lose something and even the most little thing. If I lose it, I freak out and I don't know what that's about either. It's like they're just a material thing. But it's almost like I feel like I'm losing my mind and it drives me nuts. It just drives me nuts. And it just gives me comfort to know it's there whether I use it or not. It's weird. it's just a weirdness that I have. That's part of my clutter problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Let me think here. What do you think the most important difference is between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Well, hoarding disorder is when you let the papers pile up to the point where there's just stuff that you really just don't need. But you still want to go through it. It's like at some point it's collecting dust and it's just crazy. Like I'm looking in my room right now which is just nuts. And so I think when the piles start getting pretty high ... and this caused problems in one of my relationships. My old boyfriend who walked into the kitchen, I had piles up all over. he just took his arm and went boom. And just knocked them over.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I've had enough. I have had enough of this. It has caused problems in my relationships. Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Thank you. Okay. Where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I don't really. I mean, I've seen people who are ... I mean, I've watched these shows on TV. Those people make me want to gag. I don't think I'm like that. I'm not like that. But I do know I have an issue with ... having a clean house and an orderly house. That's not me. That's not me, and I don't care. If I were having a party, and I used to have lots of parties, then I'd clean up and stuff. But I don't have parties and I go home and I like my alone time and I'm not really entertaining that much right now. And I guess entertaining would be some reason for me to clean up but otherwise, I don't care. I just don't care. I mean, I care enough to be a part of this study, but maybe I need to know why I don't care.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. yeah. Perfect. Thank you.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Are these helpful or you just say, \"Perfect, thank you\"? [crosstalk 00:15:54].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, no. Yeah. These are very, very helpful. Absolutely. It's great. Absolutely.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Okay. Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. What do you think would happen if you lost it?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "The precious things?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, the photos from your grandmother and of your family.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I would just be bereft, I don't know what I'd do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right, yeah. Do you think you have too much stuff?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. How do you know? How do you decide when you have too much?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I don't have room for everything. I have piles of craft stuff in my hallway. I'm trying to clean out my sewing room, which is a spare bedroom. I moved all of that out into the hallway and I still have a big mess, and it's taking me months to get through this.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I did finally go through, I had a huge stash, I guess you'd say, of books. I'd finally gone through some of that and let some of those things go. But I'm really having difficulty with the craft items in particular.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, with the craft items. Yeah. What if you had to choose between your items? How would you choose, if you had to throw some of them away?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I guess I would just stick with the things I know that I want to do, let the rest of it go, if I can figure out how to do that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. Does your hoarding upset you? Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Can you describe a time when your hoarding got in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I don't really quite know how to answer that. I would like to get up and have the freedom to choose what I'd like to do for the day without thinking, I can't do that until I get this cleaned up, or I need to go through this pile and take it to the thrift shop. Every day, my mind is occupied with what I should be doing, rather than what I would like to do. Does that makes sense?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes. You would say it's more general, rather than one specific instance that you can think of?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. I know we talked about how one of your sons, it was really uncomfortable for him to come in. Does it upset any of your other loved ones?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Okay, cool. You would like to change your behavior because of your son's discomfort?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Partly. Mostly, for my discomfort. I'm embarrassed that people see that I don't have control over my life. I want the freedom of mind, I want to be able to get up and enjoy things, rather than looking at more to do. If that makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Then you add to it, my son is in school in Finland, so all of his stuff, guess where it is?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's in your house.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. It becomes, when you are the depository of family things, my mother would say ... She passed away in 2011, but she would say, \"It's just stuff. It's just [inaudible 00:10:51],\" and, somehow, you feel obliged to watch out for it and it goes beyond just sentimental to, I don't know what the word is that I'm searching for, but it's beyond sentimentality and becomes almost an obligation to preserve whatever the memory is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You feel like a sense of responsibility, maybe? Or?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Then I procrastinate about things. I have a whole box of photographs that I should go through and scan in and identify while I still have memory to identify. It's very easy to procrastinate. I'm very good. I'm a professional procrastinator.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. You mentioned you have a son, but how does your family and friends feel about your difficulties with clutter? [crosstalk 00:12:05]\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yes, my daughter is very, very unhappy about it. Fortunately, I'm very grateful to say that she doesn't seem to have the hoarding gene or, at least, she hasn't given in to it, I guess is the word I'm wanting to say. So, I'm grateful for that, but I know that it drives her nuts and she wouldn't invite anyone inside my house, and I wouldn't blame her.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). How 'bout your son?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "He's accepting of it because he's not home that often, so when he is home, he realizes he wants a place to stay. There's a dining area off my kitchen that [inaudible 00:13:13] private, so he sleeps there. If he doesn't sleep there, he has to find another place to sleep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "He pretty much has no choice in the matter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Can you describe your place a little bit? You mentioned it was a one bedroom. Do you live with a partner?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "No. No, no, I live alone, thank goodness.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Maybe if I lived with someone, maybe it would be neater.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's possible, but sometimes ...\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I could still hide things. I know that I would still hide things and try to hold on to things, but have it in the boxes, in the corners. My former husband was something of a pack rat, too, so between the two of us, it was a disaster.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, thank you for that, so the next story is a little different now. John Doe has clothes that he keeps in case he needs to use in the future. Clothes occupy most of his room, except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it's difficulty for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventuality finds them. When this happens, he's usually late in getting where he needs to be. For this one, do you think this person has hoarding disorder or is it more like clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I still think it's on the hoarding side. It's just more specific to a certain type of item, it's the specific to clothes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, do you think this person should try to change their behavior, in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, you can find ways that he could probably still collect or keep clothes but not to that extreme. Get organized better, so maybe just change a little and not having to change from one extreme to the other.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does this behavior require treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Not necessarily, I've seen people on shows like Konmari, or whatever, where she's gone into homes and changed people's lives. There's a lot of people that can help others that have been through it. But psychiatrists, they make a big a difference, it just depends on the person, I think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, of course. Is this behavior similar or different to that of your own?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I mean, I do collect a lot of clothes, but I've had a lot weight shifting ups and downs, but I tend to keep it all in the bedroom. I mean, I do keep it all in the bedroom, whether it's a combination of the closet and the floor, that's about it. Like I described earlier, from the basket to the laundry bag, and then the closet, and on hangers in the closet. But the stuff that I use the most is the ones I wash and then put in the basket, and then put in the... But I still have other clothes in the dresser, and other clothes in the closet. Probably not to the same extent, but a little bit lesser.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I mean, my laptop cost me a lot, I do a lot of work on that. My dog is, when it comes to living things. A lot of my stuff is boxed up in the garage right now, because when I moved in with my parents, I just put all of my stuff in storage. I don't really have access to too much of my stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you did to choose between any of your items, how would you choose a certain item over another one?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Probably how much time I use it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, time.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Electronics are first, and then...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say expensive items are more of a priority in that sense, or is it just time?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean because I use my iPad and my laptop every day, my phone. I've been moving from hard copy books to Kindle books because of my hands. Its just easier to hold a Kindle than it is to hold onto books, it's a problem to hold books all the time. A lot of my movies are now digital copies.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does your behavior upset you in any way?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, I try to avoid looking at the floor. Because I don't care for the disorganization, but I also don't care enough to do anything about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want to have to like the idea of it doesn't feel too... If I had to rent a storage unit and if I couldn't afford it, that would upset me. I got real lucky when I had to move in and my parents had a little portion of the garage to fit all my stuff, even though they can't stand it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay, so we're going to move onto the next section here. What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Hoarding is when you can't get rid of things, so not only do you collect, but you have a time a hard time letting go. To the point that your house and living areas become a mess, and you don't have much of a social life, or you can't have people over because your place, there isn't much room, or things like that. When I had my own little apartment, I wasn't able to have people over too often because it was real crowded with stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Thank you. So for the next part of the interview, I'm going to be reading you stories and I'm going to ask you questions and you just answer the questions to the best of your ability, okay?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So for the first story, John Doe has several boxes that he likes to keep in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized but not usually cluttered. Occasionally it's different for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he's rarely late in getting where he needs to be. Okay. So the person depicted in the story, in your opinion, do you think they have hoarding disorder or is their behavior like a clutter problem?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "No. No. Neither. Neither.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So why would you say that?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Because they put them in the closet. Keeps them out of sight. I sometimes, but I've been religiously breaking down boxes and putting them in the trash. And because I used to ... and I do keep several boxes in my garage that I think I'm going to use for Christmas presents and those are sitting out in the garage. But no. I don't think he has a hoarding disorder. No. Not clutter. No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay. And is this behavior similar or different to that of your own, in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I don't store boxes in a closet and I don't have that many and I do throw them away. And I have a designated spot for my keys, but I've been in problems where I've lost my ... oh god, it drives me nuts. I can't find my keys anywhere. But that is not an issue of hoarding. That's an issue of memory. It's not hoarding. It's memory. And that's my memory is getting ... because I'm 66. So my memory is starting to go and not fun.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I'm sorry.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "It's not fun.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Saving more ... No, it's okay. Saving more ... I would imagine one big difference is that normal saving will never or almost never save more than you could ever possibly need whereas someone with hoarding attributes is just saving everything no matter what. Every single out-of-shape container forever as opposed to maybe one in two you might be able to reuse again some day. That's probably what I would think is the biggest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I would imagine their car might look similar. I don't know. I would imagine that you might recognize it in some people but not on everyone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. That makes sense. Also, what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder? Where did you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I think I'm using that phrase generically as opposed to in a critical sense. I'm an attorney and I've been involved in some matters where one of the litigants was, in fact, a hoarder and so I have been inside of homes where it was a true... you know the bathroom had 15 blenders that she bought on sale or the 15 used styrofoam containers from takeout that were kind of clean. That's kind of what comes to mind. When I think of maybe hoarding disorder, that's where my mind goes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you did view these homes for your work, did it have any affect on your personal behavior or anything?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "At the time, I don't think it did because I don't think I recognized my clutter issues as being a subset of that same issue. That's been fairly recent. No. I think it perhaps even maybe made it easier for me to separate from that because this is a person that goes out and buys six blenders. It's an extreme. You have little pathways through a house filled with newspapers from the ground to the ceiling. That was so extreme that it was easy to kind of characterize that in that way and not put myself into that category.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. That makes sense. This is actually the end of this section of the Interviewer. Thank you again. Next I will read some scenarios and then ask you some questions after each one. Does that sound good?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Okay. Yup.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. I can go on to the next scenario if you're ready.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered, and it is difficult for him to walk in his house. Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think that this person could have hoarding disorder? Or clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Could be both.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, you think so? Do you think that they should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes, for the sake of work if nothing else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah, that was a good answer. Do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah. It sounds like me. If he can't get hold of it himself, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Do you think this behavior's similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Well, similar in that he keeps things he thinks he might use in the future. I never had to spend a lot of things I knew that I'd have to have for the next day, and I was never late for work or anything like that. That part of it is not like me. But the keeping the boxes in case you might need them, that sounds perfectly like me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. Okay. The next one is, John Doe has craft items that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. Craft items occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is usually late in getting where he needs to be. Okay. Do you think that the person I read about here could have hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Do you think that they should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I think he probably is stressed from not being able to find what he needs to get through each day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good, okay. Have you tried doing that? Have you found any progress? Or is that something that you want to try to do?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "It's definitely what I want to try to do.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, good, good. I think that's actually all. Those are all the scenarios, and everything we had to go through. So if you don't want to add anything else, or anything that you have on your brain right now, I can end the recording.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I think that's complete, after that last thing, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I need to quit trying to emulate everything that I see.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, no, that makes sense. Do you think that that friend, when she told you that, do you think that she's gotten better with not buying so much home décor things?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I think she has, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "She never had quite the issue that I did, though.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. If anything, you can still apply the same mechanisms, and it doesn't mean that it won't work for you. Even if, it doesn't matter if her problem is on a much smaller scale.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Right, right. Well when she said that, then I got to thinking that yes, that probably would help me. Because I see things and I think, I'm going to go try that. There's another crafty or woodworking item that I want to do, which takes time away from what I really should be doing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. When you work on these projects, do you normally complete them?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No. Because that's the other issue. I have all these grand ideas, then I get started and I lose interest.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, okay, yeah. You lose interest. Okay. Do you think that happens to you a lot?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I have several unfinished projects right now in my home, even though I've been home all these months and could easily have completed them. That's another issue. It's adding a lot of extra stress and guilt that I haven't used my time wisely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think it's because some of the projects you take on are really big and require a lot of steps? Do you think that they were maybe smaller projects with less steps, you'd be more prone to finishing them and feeling a little bit more satisfied?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Maybe. I'm not too sure. Because it seems like I can't actually start something and complete it, anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. If that's everything you have on your mind right now, I can go ahead and end the recording, if you'd like?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. Let me end it.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Have you kept in contact with family and friends during this time? How often do you interact with them usually? Either physically or virtually.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I have a son in New York that we talk to not nearly often enough but probably once a week. We hear from him maybe less now but once every two weeks. I have siblings that I speak to all the time. For a while, with extended family, all over the east coast we used to do a Zoom family meeting every couple of weeks, which is great. That kind of stopped. Yeah. I'm keeping ... The family stays in close contact.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Did you feel socially isolated or lonely prior to COVID? Have you felt more lonely during COVID?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Definitely more lonely during COVID because I am a fairly social person and I miss getting together with people. I can't believe it's been however many months and I haven't seen the people that I work with every single day. It's just weird to me. There's this whole group of people that you spend so much time with every day and every week and then it just stops. It's so odd.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Definitely. Have you experienced conflict during COVID or less or more conflict during COVID?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I don't think there's more or less. You know, I guess frustration over politics makes my life more conflicted. You know, I did a lot of protesting. No, I don't ... I think it's about the same.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. That's actually the last part of our Interviewer. Thank you for completing this Interviewer with me. Before we go, I would like to get some demographic and payment information so we can send you that $30 gift card.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Let me ...\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I'm part of ... You guys got my name from the other study that I'm doing with the university and so I have a credit card that money gets dumped into whenever I fill out a questionnaire or something. Is that different?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I believe it's different. We will be sending you either an electronic or a physical gift card.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I just need to write down some demographic information. What gender do you identify as?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What is your race?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "White.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. What is your household income? It could be a range if that makes more sense.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Household ... $300,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Where are you located? You said southern California, right?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Do you need it more specific? Do you want the city?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. It'd just be regional so like west of the United States.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so the next story is somewhat similar. I'm going to read it, okay? John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container that the item came in, he is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stack of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered. It is difficult for him to walk in his house. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He's always late in getting where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. Does the person depicted in this story have hoarding disorder or is it more like clutter problems, in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "It's a hoarding problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and do you think this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you tell me why in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Because its affecting social life, getting to places on time, and also him getting distracted, or like you mentioned he forgot what he was doing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is this behavior similar or different to that of your own, in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Probably different.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you tell me why in your opinion.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Because I don't have to move things out of the way to get to my- well that's not... just because of the way my... Where I currently live, because I live with my parents, my mom is a neat freak and OCD in that way, so my situation's more of a clutter problem. But when I lived by myself, it was half and half clutter hoarding, so I would have to move things. Not to exactly the extent you described but when I was in the kitchen, I'd always have to move things. I did have a small kitchen though, but I didn't have a dishwasher, and I had small... Everything was just this small situation, but my kitchen looked like it was all... Everything stacked up and a mess. My bathroom was fine but my bedroom and our living were in that situation.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "... guidelines. Their guidelines. Whereas up by my house, people are free for all. Hell, nobody wears a mask and nobody ... which I also don't like because there's a lot of creeps up there and I get worried-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For sure.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "... with a kind of ... what's the word? Not lackadaisical but nonchalant kind of nonchalant attitude of people. But they've just ... there's one store where I live and they don't require masks. It's the only store I've been in ... how easy is it to stand at the door and say, \"You can't come in unless you have a mask\", and they won't do it and it drives me nuts. So I get angry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I get angry too.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Because when there are easy methods to ... and there's a bunch of creepy people up there. There's a bunch of pot growers, and it's not my favorite place. So yeah. I get upset.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Definitely. It's very tough to deal with people like that right now, for sure.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And how hard is it? The masks are so cheap. You can just go buy a pack of five of them at the drug store and wear them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Exactly. Exactly.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And wear them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know. It's really not that hard. I know.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Tons of morons up here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Don't get me started.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I won't get into ... I hope you're voting for Biden.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, definitely. Definitely.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "He's about to get rid of social security and I'm about ready to retire, but wearing masks. I'm sorry. It doesn't stand for anything. So all right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Let me see. Let me see here. Have you had any specific techniques that you found helpful dealing with COVID-19? Is there any coping techniques that you've had?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah. You stay inside.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You stay inside. Okay. Perfect.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "You stay inside. Coping... I just wear a mask and if people are shitty, I ignore them. And there are a bunch of ... not a bunch but there are some creepy people and there are some real ... like people are way over the top afraid. They're way over the top.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. For sure.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And I think I see what's happening with regard to companies like Twitter. We're here in Silicon Valley, so these big companies are not ... they're not going to have people come into work till next July. And that's not healthy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No. I agree.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "It's not healthy and I don't believe the people that are at home are working that hard. I just don't. And the reason they like it so much is because they can goof off. So they goof off. It's just bullshit. I'm sorry. That's just the way I feel about it.\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "It's different. He has the space to [inaudible 00:18:07] whereas stuff is kind of [inaudible 00:18:22], some of it [inaudible 00:18:29] these extra clothes or-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. The next vignette is John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the items came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room.

      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. So do you think this person has hoarding disorder, or his behavior is more like clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "That sounds more like hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why do you think this?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Just because the fact that it's having [inaudible 00:19:35] he can't find stuff [inaudible 00:19:44].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you think this behavior requires treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Probably, yeah. [inaudible 00:20:03] if it's not [inaudible 00:20:08].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. And how is this behavior similar or different to your own?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:20:13] definitely not, [inaudible 00:20:19] floor space to walk around, [inaudible 00:20:22].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right. The next one is, John Doe has food that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. Food occupies most of his rooms, except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bathtub. Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he's usually late in getting where he needs to be.\n",
      "So again, do you think this behavior is more like hoarding disorder or more like clutter problems and why?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "It sounds like hoarding. [inaudible 00:21:01] hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So do you think this person requires treatment for his behavior from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Very likely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then is this behavior similar or different to your own, and why?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:21:37] it's probably similar [inaudible 00:21:43].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right, perfect, thank you. Okay, so this is the last story that I'm going to read you. Okay, so John Doe has several antiques that he likes to keep, because he likes them and he knows that they are valuable. He goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried that he might get rid of an antique that's worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room, before entering his bathroom, he must remove several antique items. Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them, until he eventually finds them or forgets what he's looking for. He's almost always late getting where he needs to be, and sometimes does not show up at all. In this case, do you think this person has clutter problems or is their behavior more like hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "It's still going to be more of hoarding if he has to move things. Well, when I hear things like, \"He can't the find keys,\" I think of a clutter thing, and if you have to move things around a little bit. If it's to the point where you have a whole lot and you can't... If it's moving or spilling over into the bathroom, I start to think hoarding, because that's functional, unless you've got a whole bunch of shelves in your bathroom or something. Similar where my kitchen was, I never had things spilled into the bathroom, but I certainly did it with my kitchen. My kitchen table's full of non-kitchen items. Just random stuff from the house, stuff I was collecting, or just stuff that I didn't want to put anywhere else, because I didn't know where to put it or just procrastinating of getting organized, or whatever. I didn't have much counter space, so every time I cooked I had to move everything, so I guess I'd call it hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think this person should try to change their behavior then?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Yeah, just so they can be functional and on time for things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you really think that treatment would come from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "It could be beneficial. I think with things like that, you could get help from either a psychiatrist, or you could first start with a life coach, or just somebody that's going to take on a similar role, like when you're trying to start a diet or exercise program.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, like a support, for sure.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "A support person, but if its something you're really struggling with then you probably need to see a doctor or a psychiatrist. See if its something you might need more help with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, for sure, and do you think this behavior is similar or different from that of your own?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay, so how have you been coping, would you say? Has there been specific techniques that you've found helpful?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I haven't been using been too many good coping methods, I've used, what people would consider... What the right word is, inappropriate? Eating, binging on TV shows, things that aren't the most beneficial health wise, or mental health wise. I do read a lot, but I haven't been exercising or doing a whole lot of things that are good for my health or mental health.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, where do you think you seek comfort from? Is it from others, your items, something else?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I used to get together with friends once or twice a month, but I haven't been able to do that. Right now I have my dog that I get comfort from her, from reading, but I'm in a lot pain so I am... That's harder, and when I'm less active the pain's worse. When I'm focusing on other things, I don't have as much time to think about the pain that I'm in. I find that when I'm working and engaged in stuff, my pain is... I have bulging discs and fibromyalgia so that pain is definitely real, it's not all in my head. But I can distract myself from my pain by doing things and stuff, but when I'm not doing things, I can't distract myself from it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it's definitely tough to do.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I'm sorry, I got distracted, [crosstalk 00:40:06].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, don't worry about it. Okay, I can just go back to the questions. Were you involved in treatment for your clutter problems prior to COVID-19?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, have the people living with you changed during COVID-19 at all?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I mean, so I have siblings that are a whole generation younger, because we adopted them and they're home from school. Now they're doing school from home, and they're social life is different because they don't get to do stuff with friends as much. A lot of us are driving each other crazy, and arguments more. I've been keeping to myself in my room. It isn't a whole lot different, when I lived by myself, that's what I did. Just being around the family, when we're stuck together for months at a time, we drive each other nuts. I try to just keep my distance right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Definitely, for sure. How has COVID-19 affected your sense of isolation? Has it made you more lonely or no?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, I don't have much of a social life even before that. It's not a whole lot different, but I used to at least get together with friends once a month. I've just sat more.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Like what I was describing, it could be similar because like I was saying, I had stuff that would spill over into my kitchen and living room. But I did have a really small apartment, but that doesn't mean if I had a bigger apartment it would get any better. But, thank goodness I didn't have a bigger apartment, because I know [inaudible 00:33:45]. But yeah, I'd say it could describe me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, okay. Perfect, thank you, so that ends the story portion. This last part is about COVID-19, and so I'm going to be asking you questions again. Please let me know if you need clarification or are uncomfortable answering any of the questions, okay?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How has COVID-19 impacted your life?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I went out of work when it started, because the schools closed and I was teaching at the time. I was a substitute teacher, so I had a long-term assignment but I wasn't a permanent teacher. I didn't get rehired when they reopened it, because the remote teaching stuff, so I was out of a job for four months. I gained 20 pounds because I was really depressed, stuck at home, and ended up... I would buy a bunch of stuff just because sometimes when I get stressed out, that's what I'll do. I'd eat a lot of junk food, and stuff like that. I finally got a job in July, so my stress levels went down a bit, but I still had some depression. When I'm not working I just seem to just be sleeping a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, do you think that COVID-19 has affected difficulties throwing away things? Has it made it worse to throw away things?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Well, I haven't really gone out. I mean, the stuff I do get I shop online for, but I don't know because I haven't really had things that I've gotten, whatever, things that I need to throw away. But when I do get new things, I have hard time throwing away the boxes they come in, because I think that, \"Maybe what if I have to return this? I'm going to need the box to ship it back in.\" Things like that. It's hard to answer that question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, of course. Do you think that now that you're home all time, do you have time to organize or is that something that's not [crosstalk 00:36:34]?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I should, but I haven't. I feel like I'm tired all the time and I lack energy. When I was doing the teaching, I seemed to be more physically active, and now I seem to just... I think part of it's the depression, I'm less physically active because I'm working from home, and so my body's a lot weaker. Like I said, I gained 20 pounds since it started, and I've been more anxious, and a little more depressed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "To have more [inaudible 00:13:37] space, and more [inaudible 00:00:13:50]. Not having to make a big deal in terms of [inaudible 00:14:00].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "No, I don't think so. I've done this at times, I've [inaudible 00:14:14].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So what do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Like it [inaudible 00:14:36] use your space, [inaudible 00:14:44].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So how is that the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I don't think [inaudible 00:15:01] I keep a bunch of stuff that is just not [inaudible 00:15:08] stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Asking them [inaudible 00:15:30], no, I guess not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. I do know you mentioned the show Hoarders. So where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I'm not even sure I've ever seen [inaudible 00:15:43] I saw a bit, and it's a good TV show, [inaudible 00:15:51].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Nice. So what do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Just these images of people kind of [inaudible 00:16:01] with stuff piled up, [inaudible 00:16:01] stuff around as much as they can, [inaudible 00:16:01] and otherwise it's just stuff piled up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So for the next part, I will now read some vignettes and ask you some questions after each one.\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. So John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the items came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized, but it usually is not cluttered. Occasionally it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be. So do you think the person depicted could have hoarding disorder, or is their behavior more like clutter problems, and why?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I guess more [inaudible 00:17:20] if they're keeping that extra stuff, I guess he's got the space so it's not a [inaudible 00:17:24] or the space the guy lives in is really small, [inaudible 00:17:24] not to get rid of the box [inaudible 00:17:24] maybe he's not going to [inaudible 00:17:52].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you think this person should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "No, not necessarily. If it's bothering him.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Is this behavior similar or different to your own?\n",
      "003\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Done. (silence).\n",
      "Okay. So as you know this study is investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs relating to having hoarding disorder. The first question would be, what term do you prefer when we are talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I'm not sure. I guess just whatever the standard is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We can do hoarding, clutter problems, anything like that.\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Oh, I guess clutter problems. I'm not sure if that's hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. The next part is more of a conversation. I'll ask you questions for you to answer, and feel free to ask questions if you need clarification. If any questions make you uncomfortable, let me know. You do not need to answer them.\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you please describe your clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Oh, there's a lot of stuff just laying around. [inaudible 00:04:50] I've got some used tissues, there's a couple bags of trash that need to go out in a few days. Let's see, in the living room [inaudible 00:05:04] there's mail thrown on the table, there's a couple of empty soda boxes that are just [inaudible 00:05:27]. That's about all I can think of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Oh. It was worse when I was a kid, because my mom was annoyed with it all the time. I try to be better about it, but its hard.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). How severe would you say that this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "It's not like anything out of the TV show, but my place is messy enough that I notice it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hm (affirmative). Do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah? Why do you think-\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "It is a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why do you think that?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I think it's [just that I don't have a place for everything [inaudible 00:06:43].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do your family and friends know about the behavior, and if so, how do they feel about it?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "I never talk about [inaudible 00:07:05].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. And you say they don't go to your house?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Not a lot. [inaudible 00:07:07] sometimes, but [inaudible 00:07:14].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. And have you ever sought to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Kind of I have. I know [inaudible 00:07:28].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And have you ever gone to a professional for help with this behavior?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "No, I don't think it's that bad right now, [inaudible 00:07:51] other than maybe a professional cleaner.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you please describe where you live now?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "In terms of the clutter, or in terms of the general-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like in general, what does your house look like? Like how many rooms?\n",
      "Participant  004:\n",
      "Oh, it's just an apartment [inaudible 00:08:11], it's in a secure building [inaudible 00:08:15] to key in.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have the people living with you changed during COVID?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. How have you kept in contact with family and friends?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Email, Facebook, messaging, telephone, Zoom.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Do you interact with them often?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Daily.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Daily.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Not everybody daily.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "But yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "But someone at least daily.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good. I know you mentioned that you were feeling a little bit lonely. Did you feel socially isolated or lonely prior to COVID?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Then you would say that COVID has affected your sense of isolation?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Have you experienced conflict during COVID-19? With measures or anything else?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. That was the end of this little section. Now, I want to go onto the section called vignettes, which is essentially, I'm going to read you a little prompt, then I'm going to ask you if the person in these prompts could have hoarding disorder, or their behavior's more cluttered rather than hoarding. Then if this person should try to change their behavior, do you think they require treatment from a psychiatrist? And if it's similar or different than yours. I can repeat all these questions at the end of each little story if you want me to. I just wanted to give you a heads up.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. The first one, John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container the item came in. He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he might need later. Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets, but there are no boxes in other rooms. His house is not always organized, but is usually not cluttered. Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet, so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them. When this happens, he is rarely late in getting where he needs to be.\n",
      "Okay. Do you think that the person here could have hoarding disorder? Or more clutter?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I wouldn't call it either one, honestly. It sounds pretty normal to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay yeah. Do you think they should try to change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Could he find a specific spot to keep his keys and wallet?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah. You don't think that he would require treatment from a physician or a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that this behavior is similar or different to your own.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Similar, I was never late for work or anything because of this. I do keep the boxes, but [inaudible 00:27:32] then because I keep thinking I'm going to put things in them to bring to the thrift shop.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. All right. So first question is how has COVID-19 impacted your life? What specific behaviors has changed?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Going into work. I can't go in and see other people. When I go out and run, if I'm not wearing a mask, people start cowering and yelling at me. It's ridiculous. I'm out on a trail six feet away from somebody. They're ... But you know, in all fairness, it hasn't changed my life that much because once I was working from home quite a bit before and I did lose my job last January, and partly due to COVID because they closed our San Francisco office because the company was having money problems anyway, but they closed the San Francisco office and everybody is working remotely for good, which I think is really bad. It's really bad. I think it's alienating people and people are having problems-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "... and eating more than normal. When I'm up by my house where I can cook, and that's not good. I've had some health problems because I don't know why. I'm having some right now. I just got back from the doctor. So it's caused health problems. And we have had horrible fires in the Bay Area. And so the smoke travel here has been horrible for the last couple weeks.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "This is like the year from hell.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "The year from hell.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's horrible.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Absolutely horrible.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. So how in your opinion has COVID-19 affected your acquiring habits, including buying things?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Well, losing a job affects you buying things. You just cut way back.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Exactly. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I actually just bought a couple things for myself. I'm collecting unemployment. And I got a severance and so I'm okay right now. But I'm certainly not out buying big ticket items.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Has it affected your difficulties with throwing things away?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No? Okay. Perfect.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "No. Mm-hmm (negative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How has COVID-19 affected your sense of connectedness or attachment to your items?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "It hasn't.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I mean, it doesn't affect it one way or the other.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Let's see. Oh, how have you been coping since COVID-19 started?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I was fine until I left my job. But I'm at the point where I'm almost ready to retire and I'm in the final interviews for a new job. I don't know what'll happen but I'm kind of just taking it, I don't know ... I'm not getting really upset about it. I'm continuing to live my life. And depending on where you're located, different areas are more ... like the Bay Area is much more rigid about their COVID-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Measures? Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "If I can't use it, and it's machinery or something, yeah, I'd be happy to pass it along. I have a collection right now of vintage linens. A huge collection of handmade linen doilies and bedspreads and tablecloths. I don't need them. My kids don't want them. To them, they're just old fashioned. But I cannot let go of them. I don't know what it is. I just have this hard time letting go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, no, it makes sense. Especially with something that, did you make those doilies?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "No, no. The things that my grandmother made and passed to me, I've kept and I've labeled them for my kids. But anytime I go to an estate sale or a yard sale or anything and there's vintage handmade things, I snap them up because I think, I don't want them to be thrown away or discarded, some people put a lot of time and effort into that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Even though I have no use for it. I do use some things. But I can't possibly use everything I have.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Really, I basically have come to the realization that I just need to avoid any place where I might be tempted to bring things home. If I don't see it, I won't do it. This is completely off topic for you and I'm sorry to interrupt, somebody said to me recently that she doesn't look at home décor magazines or websites or anything because it always gave her a sense that she needed more, or she needed to do something to her home. And I realized that I have spent years looking through magazines, books, and lifestyle TV shows and trying to update my life to go along with that, or things that I want to try in my house. I realize, maybe if I'm not looking at all that stuff all the time, I won't. I'll be satisfied with things the way they are.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah. I've stopped. I had a few magazine subscriptions that I have let lapse because of that. I'm not taking any kind of magazines anymore at all. Because I was afraid. I thought, perhaps, that it would help me not to be looking to change things all the time. I don't know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, no, that makes sense. It relates to how, obviously COVID is a much bigger scale. But you mentioned that because you're not able to go out, you find yourself buying less things. It sounds like the same thought process applied here. If you're not looking at all these things, then you might not be as prone to getting them or storing them.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Or just feeling like you need more things.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Correct. Yeah.\n",
      "002\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right. Okay, so my first question would be, what term would you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Probably clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, clutter...problems.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I mean, it's both, I see them as two separate but similar issues.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right, perfect. The next part is more of a conversation, so I'll just ask you questions for you to answer. Feel free to ask questions if you need clarification, and if any questions make you at all uncomfortable, let me know, you do not need to answer them, okay?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so can you can you please describe your clutter problems? How long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Probably since I was a kid, I've always been... I'd always just start with probably procrastination. I probably have, every once a year, or once every six months, I do one major cleaning weekend, whatever, and get it all nice and neat. That lasts for about a week, and then just its gets all messed up again. But when I was in high school, I got into a car accident and my back got injured, and so I have a lot of back pain. It makes it hard for me to do household chores, and things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For sure, I'm sorry about that.\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Part of it is just health reasons, and then I also have some depression, so some of it's mood. Because I do have some pain management stuff. Some things are managed but, other things are just mood, so I say it's half and half.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, all right, thank you. For the next question I was going to ask, how severe would you say that this behavior is now? Do you believe that your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I mean, I'm mostly functional, I work full-time. I don't really have a social life, but that's related to my health and stuff, but it is still a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, have you ever sought to change this behavior? Have you gone to a professional to help for this behavior or no?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Could you tell me why?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "I never really thought about it being so much of mental thing before, it's just a laziness thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, I understand. All right, how do your family and friends feel about this behavior? Have you ever had conflicts with people close to you about the behavior?\n",
      "Participant 2:\n",
      "Yeah, lots of things, arguments with parents, and things like that. They sometimes spent the long weekends helping me with getting it back together, and then only to have me get it all messed up again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel socially isolated or lonely prior to COVID-19?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Well, a little bit because my job changed to the point... See, in my last job, the woman ... well, the whole company changed. So our headquarter were in Mountain View. A company bought ... so I started with this company when it was LifeLock. LifeLock two weeks after I started got bought by Symantec. I worked for them and helped them for about seven months, and Symantec laid me off. And Symantec hired me back. And I worked for them for about a year and a half. And then Broadcom bought Symantec.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, wow. Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "So then the company split and I had been in the San Francisco office and wanted to stay there and they moved the corporate headquarters to Arizona which is where LifeLock was because it's cheaper. And so then they laid me off and they reorganized and they laid me off and it's the second time I've been laid off by the same company. So what I see is that before I wasn't happy in my job because everybody I worked with was in a different city. All my team was in Arizona or ... and that all was recent. That has all just changed. So all the changes were driving me nuts. And it was too far for me to drive to Mountain View and then they decided they were going to close the San Francisco office so I'm like, then I don't have a job because then my only option was to move to Arizona.\n",
      "So here I am in this horrible job market with all these other people and I'm pretty experienced. So I mean, I've had these major interviews with a company and gone to the final interview, but I don't know. I can't count on anything right now, so that uncertainty is not good.\n",
      "We're all living with uncertainty. I don't do well with uncertainty.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For sure. I don't either. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Uncertainty is not cool.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Absolutely not.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "And people ... there's just people that are prolonging the situation because they won't conform and do what needs to be done. Wear a freaking mask, you know?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. I agree completely. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Stupid ass.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know. So the next question is, have you experienced conflict during the COVID-19 measures? That could be with like family or with anyone.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Who needs it, really? But, I couldn't bring myself to throw it away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would happen if you lost it or it accidentally got thrown away?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Oh, I'd be very upset with myself. What can you say? That's just ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Another version of this question is, if you had to choose between your items, how would you make that decision? How would you choose?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "I don't know. I have no idea. Honestly, have not a clue how I would do that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. That's a fine response. I mean, it'd be a very difficult decision to make.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. Again, if you have to make it, you have to make it, but it'd certainly not be an easy thing if you have to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yeah, you'd have to do it and it's just, again, it's a matter of the feelings of guilt, or maybe getting rid of something that you should've held on to or that you should've appreciated more than you did.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's a good point. Okay. You mentioned that your behavior does upset you a bit, do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Hard to say, but what's gotten in the way of my daily life is the whole spinal stenosis thing and, frankly, my inability to get around like I used to. I used to take ... And, of course, coronavirus, because the gym that I go to that is part of my healthcare.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Therapy?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Well, no, the Medicare insurance I've got includes membership in a really good, local gym.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "With coronavirus, they're closed. So, I can't do that. So, that has, frankly, interfered with my ability to feel like I'm staying in shape and stay in touch. I used to take Thai chi, very intensive Thai chi, and I can't take that right now because I can't stand long enough to do even a single part of the form.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "That's very frustrating. There's more than just the clutter going on here. It's also my current physical limitations. It's extremely frustrating.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you would say more that, it is, now, your health has impacted how you get around your house?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it's become more of a burden on you?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yes, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's more noticeable that there's, oh, this is actually a more difficult way to live because of your current situation?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. You touched a little bit about how COVID's impacted your life, we actually have a set of questions that's, specifically, about COVID. You mentioned that you can no longer go to the gym and that you've had the surgery. You said in June, right?\n",
      "Participant 007:\n",
      "June, yes.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "The fact that you have to move things to even take a shower, that's even more extreme than I am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Do you think that this kind of behavior should require treatment from a psychiatrist?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Possibly. I don't really know about that, that's what I need to learn about.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Is this behavior similar or different to yours?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Part of it's similar, in that I keep a lot of craft stuff in thinking that I might need it. I have some stuff in almost every room. Although I don't have anything in my bathrooms and my guest room. But mainly it's my hallway, then my craft room. Then I have a pile of stuff in my living room that I'm constantly working on, trying to go through. I can use my kitchen and bathrooms and stuff with no issue.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Like I said, I never had problems with, well, I shouldn't say I never did. I haven't for many, many years had trouble with finding keys or anything like that. Once I decided where it was going to be, and always made sure it was there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. When it goes to getting to places, and your car keys and such, do you have a designated spot for that? Or do you just always remember where it is?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah I have a designated spot, partly because I can't remember where things are half the time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, okay. Then despite all the clutter and everything, that's always been a constant for you?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah, for the last 30 years, 40 years, probably yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Early in my life, no. I used to have a lot of trouble. I always felt like, this sounds terrible, because I hate to blame my mother. She was a wonderful mother. But I wasn't taught how to organize, as a kid. I only learned that later, through working and school. Yeah, organization's been a real problem for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I have two sisters, who are the opposite of me. They're very neat, very tidy. My mother was very neat and tidy. I just always felt that I never learned it, I don't know why.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, no, don't apologize, you're good. Do you think that your sisters did retain the information that your mother tried teaching you? Or do you not feel like your mother tried teaching you any kind of organization?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah. I was not taught any. In fact, my mom never, when we had to move her into an Alzheimer's facility a few years ago, we realized she had never kept paperwork. We had to reconstruct things. She never filed things. I just never learned that from her.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Was that a case of, she never filed them, and instead she just threw them away?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "005\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. To begin, as you know, this study is investigating individual attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder. The first question is what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. Sounds great. Thank you. Once again, thank you for creating those lists. The next part of this Interviewer is more of a conversation. I will ask you some questions for you to answer and feel free to ask questions if you need clarification. If any question makes you uncomfortable just let me know and you don't need to answer that question.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. First, can you please describe your clutter and how long has this been going on?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Describe my clutter? Things ... Is it best with an example? Like mail that has stacked up, that I haven't yet gotten to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah or how severe would you say this behavior is?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Moderate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Moderate? Okay. Do you think that this behavior has been a problem for you or for your family?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "It has definitely been an issue for at least I would say 30 years, maybe not as severe as it is now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change this behavior or have you ever gone to a professional or anything?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I have never sought treatment. Honestly, I think I am just now starting to see it as a problem or as something that might be able to be fixed. You know, I think in the past it was just I was messy. Now it's clearly more than that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Have you ever had any conflicts with the people around you such as a landlord or family?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Not a landlord but definitely with my daughter at times.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "She's living at home again and there's certain things that have not moved out of certain rooms that are on their way somewhere else. You know, it just makes it hard to use that room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Can you please describe where you live now? You might have mentioned it. Do you live alone? What is the space like in your home?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I have a home, kind of one and a half stories, that I've only lived here for three years and my daughter moved back home a year ago. It's got three bedrooms and the downstairs is kind of a play room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, no, of course. You would be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I am upset, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. You're upset currently because you can't get rid of them?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think you would be even more upset if you had to get rid of them?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. I see.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "It's crazy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Did you want to elaborate a little bit on that? On why you think it's crazy?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Well I want it out of my house. I want it out of my life. But I think I look at it and I think, well I might be able to use that, or that might be something that somebody wants. Even though my children have both told me they don't want any of it, and actually the son who is more organized in his life, he has said to me that if I die, he's just going to have somebody come in and just scoop it out, get rid of everything. I really do need to go through it all and make sure that I keep only what's really possibly of interest to the family and get rid of the rest of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, of course.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I'm getting to the age where I don't want to die and have all this extra they need to go through.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then what do you think would be the most important differences between what's considered normal saving behavior like collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I have so many collections, and overabundance of everything. So much of collections that they're no longer valuable, you know what I mean? Yeah, go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, no. Finish what you're saying.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I was just going to say, if I look at any one collection, I have so much of it that it's kind of lost its importance.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "I don't know how to describe that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, you did a good job. Then what would you think is the most important difference, if you started collecting something for value. Then now that you say you have too much of it. What do you think is that line, where it goes into collecting, into hoarding.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "When I don't even know where to put it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Let's see. Do you think there's a way to tell if somebody has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 006:\n",
      "Perhaps, if I shopped with them and they were constantly picking up little things, like I do. If they were constantly picking up things and they thought, I could use that, or that might come in handy. Then yeah, I would think that they have the same problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. That makes sense. I'm going to go ahead and read the next scenario. John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move. When the items are delivered to his house, he keeps the containers the item came in because he's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later. Stacks of boxes occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom, he must remove several stacks of boxes. His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.\n",
      "Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for. He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Similar to the previous scenario, I'm asking you the same question as do you think this person has hoarding disorder or do you think their behavior is more like a clutter problem and why?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "This sounds more like a hoarding behavioral issue because now that future need, even if it never comes to fruition, is completely occupying his whole life as opposed to a single closet. It's impacting his ability to function on a day to day basis.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think for this person should they seek treatment or should they seek some kind of resource to help change their behavior?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I would say yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Would you say that this behavior is similar or different to your own in this scenario or why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "I don't believe mine is ... I think I have some of those attributes but more along the lines of a closet, even though it's not limited to a single closet. It doesn't impact my ability to function every day.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "It is similar but not nearly as ... John Doe's is much more extreme.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. I'm going to read the next scenario. John Doe has boxes of papers that he keeps in case he needs to use it in the future. These boxes of paper occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom. Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bath tub and sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until eventually he finds them. When this happens, he is usually late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Same question, do you believe John Doe in this scenario has more of a clutter problem or do you think it's more serious?\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "For these questions, you are, in fact ... If I'm understanding it, you're drawing a distinction between a hoarder and somebody with a clutter problem or someone that's messy?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Is that correct?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 005:\n",
      "Okay. I'm not sure what the pieces of paper are but I don't think this is clutter. I think this is a problem. I think this is more of a hoarding issue.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Is there a reason why this one is or is it similar to the previous example for you?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Okay. So last story for you. John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and he knows they're valuable. So he goes out once a week and buys more antiques. He's worried that he might get rid of an antique that is worth a lot of money. Antiques occupy every room. Before entering his bathroom he must remove several antique items. Often, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he's looking for. He is almost always late in getting where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all. So in your opinion, do you think this person have-\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Clutter problems again?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah. Well, clutter. Yeah. Clutter. Because it's ridiculous. He has so many antiques that they impede his behavior and cause problems in his life.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Is this behavior similar or different to that of your own in your opinion?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Different.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And why would you say that?\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Because I'm not late to my meetings and I mean it's the same in that I collect clothes like that. I may collect ... but they're in my closet. And I put my keys in one spot. I mean, that's why I do it. Because I have a spot so I don't lose them. And there's just certain things you got to be careful of and they're major things. The keys are major to get you out of the house and get you out the door.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah. Of course.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "So yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "I mean, you would think that one episode of 30 minutes trying to find keys would cure that problem. The person would be like, I got a problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative). You would definitely think so. Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. Perfect. So that's the end of the stories. So we're going to go ... this last part of the interview is about COVID-19 and again, I'll just be asking you questions again. So again, any clarification please feel free to ask me. If you're uncomfortable answering any of the questions, just let me know. Absolutely no problem.\n",
      "Participant 1:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "P1: Yeah okay okay um so the next section that we wanted to move in to was kind of on a related note and we wanted to talk about some of the explanations that some patients have for their behavior with hoarding disorder with their patients we wanted you to think through some of the questions from the adopted version of that brown assessment of belief deal and we want you to kind of think from the patient’s perspective how your patients would respond to some of these questions so the first one that we have was what do you think has caused you to have these behaviors?\n",
      "Do you think these behaviors have a psychiatric or underlying biological cause?\n",
      "How do you think your patients or the research subjects that you see would reply to those to that question?\n",
      "Interviewee: Uh I think that that I think it differs depending on the education level the patients have you could get some pretty different answerer to that question um but I think that the general answer that most of my patients would say is that ‘I've always liked stuff I don’t know where that came from but I've always liked it’\n",
      "P2: And you think that that changes over the course of coming to understand they really have a disorder or do you think that that is pretty constant um I guess what I'm trying to get at is do you think that the process of getting insight changes this?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um I don’t know if insight would change that answer I mean certainly if they\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (1:35:43)\n",
      "Interviewee: Been through our group and we’ve told them that it is you know we we find that a lot of our patients feel a lot of relief um from having been told that there’s a lot of this you know that notion about you had a lot of cards in the deck that kind of predisposed you to developing this um they feel really relieved by that\n",
      "P1: Ham okay the next question that we wanted to ask was if you had to asked patients who argue that they need to keep these things that something bad will come from discarding them how do you think they would respond to that?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well that sounds like a very OCD focused question that’s maybe the researcher commenting on that I think a lot of our patients if we were to ask them about that like something bad will happen I think that if our patients have OCD hoarding then they will be like ‘yes’ and then if they have hoarding because of hoarding disorder they’d be like ‘what do you mean something bad is going to happen well maybe I mean I don’t want to be wasteful’ but I think that question wont make as much sense to them like if I were to ask you guys ‘why do you you know keep your old note or why do you keep a card that you know your partner gave you on your last anniversary like are you afraid that something bad will happen if you get rid of it?\n",
      "it be like well no I'm keeping it because I value it\n",
      "P2: So that kind of fear or anxiety based for you are a big part of the difference between OCD hoarding and hoarding\n",
      "036\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no, no. With are done with our listing so why don't you go ahead and give me an example, because we're going to go now into just the portion of the interview that's more of a conversation.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "For reasons I don't thoroughly understand, the State of Texas changed your driver's license requirements in terms of identification, and I don't ...\n",
      "So [inaudible 00:06:19] goes on I don't ... I live I Texas so I see it here.\n",
      "Now, failed to renew my driver's license for nearly a year and a half because they want the hard copy social security card, and I finally found my social security card two weeks ago and I was happy to come across it again.\n",
      "The other 1950 stuff and it's still there, still have it but I finally found it.\n",
      "So now I've got an appointment to go down and renew my driver's license.\n",
      "Now, had I been able to [relevantly 00:06:57] find that social security card?\n",
      "I would have my driver's license renewed some time ago.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:07:05].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you were unable to find a really important document because you had saved so many documents and it actually ended up holding you up?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "So many different places to boot.\n",
      "I got one in one stash and it just makes it so [inaudible 00:07:19].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:07:22].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That is a good example of where you might want a document and you just can't find it because you have so many.\n",
      "Could you start out by telling me a little bit about how these problems developed?\n",
      "When did you first notice these problems in your life?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "I'm not really sure.\n",
      "I just, grew up with them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So your whole life.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "My father had them.\n",
      "I can recognize that now but I didn't recognize it at the time.\n",
      "So on a ranch and you seldom throw anything you way, you throw ...\n",
      "Garbage someplace full of stuff and if you want it, you go look for it.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:08:08] pull them up and do something else with the [inaudible 00:08:10].\n",
      "That type of thing.\n",
      "It's growing up On a ranch [inaudible 00:08:15] and you're [inaudible 00:08:17].\n",
      "So I didn't recognize it as hoarding so much as keeping stuff.\n",
      "But it's a part of the environment, I can [guess 00:09:14]...\n",
      "Where you are determines if it's a problem or not.\n",
      "To give you [inaudible 00:09:14] my brother brought it home to me, for us ...\n",
      "I've got ... [inaudible 00:09:14].\n",
      "(silence)\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:09:14] but I realized-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You actually ...\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "... I don't have a shop.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Go ahead, sorry.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I still watch it now.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Since moving back to Florida, I watch it even more.\n",
      "I've always been watching Hoarders for years, but then it really picked up when [inaudible 00:34:27], \"Okay,\" and my mom was really pushing me to the point of aggravation, like it was getting on both of our nerves because I'm like, \"I want to do it this way,\" and she's like, \"No, I know how you are.\n",
      "You have to get rid of this stuff, or else you're just going to have it.\"\n",
      "Even now, she's like, \"Okay, you still have too much stuff,\" but just more so once picking up once I, like the last two weeks I was in Maryland and then now I watch at least three or four episodes of Hoarder, or cleaning YouTube accounts.\n",
      "Like [inaudible 00:35:00] on YouTube.\n",
      "Well that's her Instagram name, but I'll watch different cleaning videos of people cleaning their home and organize their home.\n",
      "I watch at least 10, 15 videos of those type a week just to keep myself focused, even though I could do a lot more.\n",
      "It's just to keep me focused.\n",
      "I watch it a lot.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:35:24]-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah, sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, you're good.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I talk a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, you're fine.\n",
      "I mean that's what we want.\n",
      "We want to understand your beliefs and your ideas, and how you manage this.\n",
      "So this next section's not really most people's favorites because it's talking about distress and the emotional side of it.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So does your behavior upset you at all?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Sometimes.\n",
      "When we moved, it was frustrating having to get rid of a lot of stuff because I don't have the space for it.\n",
      "Some things I'm like, \"Man, why did I donate that?\" I'm thinking of a couple of things I donates and I shouldn't have, and then also with the move, some of the stuff my mom accidentally donated that I wanted to keep, and my mom was like, \"Oh well.\"\n",
      "I'm like, \"Come on.\n",
      "If I donated your stuff by accident, you wouldn't like it,\" but we've collectively both donated each other's stuff by accident since the move, so ... [inaudible 00:36:36] was aggravating, but that's the only thing.\n",
      "I feel like when I move on my own, it won't be like that.\n",
      "I feel like any time you live with someone else, there's pros and cons.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "The memories that I have associated with them.\n",
      "I have some head scarves that my grandma gave me, and my grandma passed away three years ago.\n",
      "She gave them to me when I was in high school and I still have them, and then pictures.\n",
      "I have a stuffed animal from when I was five.\n",
      "I got it for my fifth birthday.\n",
      "It's on my bed right now.\n",
      "So, yeah.\n",
      "It's like the emotions that you have attached to them and then the different memories that you have with them, like some nail polishes, like, \"Okay, this is a color that my mom likes or my grandma,\" she would've liked different things like that, or, \"This is some jewelry or a bag that my grandma gave me or my mom gave me.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So the memories associated and all the emotions associated with the object makes them more valuable.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So the opposite side of that is what is trash for you?\n",
      "What do you discard and how do you know when it's time to get rid of something?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:19:21], like I'm learning if I don't wear it or if I'm not that size, then it doesn't make any sense.\n",
      "I'm a 16/18 now.\n",
      "Of course I don't want to be that size forever.\n",
      "I've been that size for several years now, but it doesn't make any sense for me to keep [inaudible 00:19:41] size 10 or a size 12 because I'm not that size yet.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:19:47], and then trash.\n",
      "I know what's trash.\n",
      "I'm not holding onto used tissues or anything like that, or if something rips and it can't be fixed, I'm not keeping it.\n",
      "If it's something that's raggedy, I'm not going to keep it because, yeah.\n",
      "I like a lot of things, I like to have a lot of things, but I like quality items.\n",
      "I don't hold onto things that look raggedy.\n",
      "Yeah, I don't do that.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:20:23] hold onto cheap things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's just in there because some people have a hard time processing the value of something [crosstalk 00:20:38]-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Yeah, no. This is for people on very different spectrums, so of course I understand.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So our next set of questions is what is the most precious item in your house for you, and why is it valuable?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Wow, that's hard.\n",
      "My most precious items?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So if you could choose one, like if your house was on fire and you have to grab one thing, what would you have?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Probably, what would be the one thing ...?\n",
      "Probably my purse because it has my passport, my ID ... something identification-wise.\n",
      "I'm just thinking about like, \"Okay, what's something I'm really going to need?\" I could just take my cellphone.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "My cellphone?\n",
      "That has everything on it, but now I'm like, \"Okay ...\"\n",
      "Yeah, my cellphone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So for her it's a problem because the stuff is making it difficult for her to get into the house.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "To get around.\n",
      "You put your first kind of- used to have all my closets.\n",
      "She had a place to keep boxes like a gag.\n",
      "At first the house was okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So the first person doesn't have this problem, because all his boxes are put away and out of the way.\n",
      "But, the second person has a problem they're all out and it's difficult to move around in the house and it's a safety issue.\n",
      "Does that sound right?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "That's how I think of it, yes ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And what about you?\n",
      "Where do you think you fall between these people in terms of your problems?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "My problem I would say, in between or I'd say probably closer to the fellow who has the closet full of box.\n",
      "I'd say maybe halfway.\n",
      "I used to block way in my room, if there's just space I can lay down on do some poetry signs.\n",
      "For my little walk around the neighborhood.\n",
      "So id say I've got a problem but it's under control right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So, you're kind of more between them but maybe even closer to the first person than the second person right now?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yes ma'am.\n",
      "To make a long story short I pretty much quit getting stuff from Amazon and the likes because there literally boxes here that we hardly ever use.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "So what about this person?\n",
      "We did John and Jane we'll do...lets se, what a good name?\n",
      "Peter.\n",
      "\" Peter has a lot of tools in his house that he keeps in case he needs to use them, tools occupy most of his rooms except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower, he must remove some of these items from his bath tub, sometimes it's difficult for peter to find his car keys and his wallet, so he'll spend so or 20 minuets looking fr them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens he is sometimes late in getting to where he needs to be\".\n",
      "Do you think that this is a person who has hoarding problems?\n",
      "Interviewer: Are there ways that you can help a patient try to gain insight?\n",
      "Is that something that you try to do?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think for those that are amenable to it a medical model can help.\n",
      "Understanding that this is a biological disorder that can progress with age and that can be treated with behavior therapy and sometimes with medications.\n",
      "That helps.\n",
      "I think not everybody’s amenable to that.\n",
      "Some people… So, you have to figure out what model of explanation is amenable to the patient.\n",
      "Some people the medical model is very helpful.\n",
      "For some people understanding that our goal as treating clinicians is not to empty their homes, but to make them safe, not to take away their sentimental attachments, will help them gain insight and ability to discard things.\n",
      "So, it is a little bit about kind of assessing what their underlying ideas about their own symptoms are and working towards an inroad there.\n",
      "Which is really kind of what the context of motivational interviewing is.\n",
      "Find where they’re motivated to make a change.\n",
      "Do you want your grandchildren to come?\n",
      "How do we make that possible?\n",
      "This isn’t for you, this is for your kids.\n",
      "Some of those things can help.\n",
      "But to be honest those folks don’t tend to stick around in treatment, they tend not to come in because this is not something that’s well recognized as an illness.\n",
      "It’s still seen as a behavior that is intentional or volitional, and therefore there’s a fair amount of shame and defensiveness around that.\n",
      "That isn’t insight per se because that’s cultural, right?\n",
      "That’s how society conceptualizes this disorder right now.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: To me insight is, despite kind of a recognized, societally recognized understanding of something, your view of it is different and limited, and I don’t think we’re there for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, what do you think causes a patient to fail to gain insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s biology actually.\n",
      "I really think that insight is neuronally driven.\n",
      "I think we can modify it to some degree and work with it.\n",
      "I think just like in schizophrenia it’s not volitional, and, as in schizophrenia, we don’t try to change patients’ minds.\n",
      "We try to work with them without endorsing their delusional states, also without directly challenging them.\n",
      "I don’t think that insight is a volitional thing that you can work on in therapy.\n",
      "I think you can modify it and shift it to a degree, but I really think it’s biologically based and maybe progressive actually.\n",
      "Lack of insight may be progressive.\n",
      "It may be a marker of severity of illness, I’m not sure.\n",
      "Interviewer: I know you mentioned the psychiatrist’s role in improving patients’ quality of life.\n",
      "How much do you feel like insight or the lack thereof impinges on an individual’s quality of life?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it can impinge on it quite directly.\n",
      "I think many of the people who die in hoarding houses lack insight.\n",
      "I think people who animal hoard and live in really fettered conditions with starving animals lack insight.\n",
      "So, I think insight is actually a prime motivator or prime cause of impaired quality of life.\n",
      "I think people with better insight are more motivated for treatment and are motivated for change.\n",
      "Whether they’re successful or not on their own is a different question, but they’re the ones who come in seeking treatment and are always trying to declutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A bigger clutter volume?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Is there a way to tell, we kind of talked about this a little bit but I just want to ask again.\n",
      "Is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "You talked about flea markets or people wearing those different color shirts, is there anything else you can think of?\n",
      "And the compulsive-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Well, occasionally I have walking the street or walking some place, I'm very aware of the person if they lean down and pick up off the ground either on the sidewalk or on the ground something that, some people have a phobia about picking up anything that is on the ground, particularly on the sidewalk in a public place.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "If I see somebody do that I have often thought, \"Oh, they save things like I save things.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Seeing that similar saving behavior?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Can you notice that when you go into their home or can you notice that when you're just speaking with them and they start talking about the stuff that they save?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Sometimes people do that.\n",
      "I usually would chime in and say, \"Well, if you think your habit is bad, you should see mine.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Totally.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Now we're going to go into another section of our interview.\n",
      "What I'm going to do is I'm going to read these stories.\n",
      "These are just little stories about someone that might have hoarding disorder or might not, so I want you after I read it to tell me whether or not you think this person has hoarding disorder or maybe they just have issues with clutter.\n",
      "That make sense?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy one of his closets but there are no boxes in other rooms.\n",
      "His house is not always organized but it is usually not cluttered.\n",
      "Occasionally, it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend a few minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens he is rarely late in getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Do you think that this person has hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And why do you think that?\n",
      "P1: So the last list prompt that we had was can you list reasons people might seek treatment for hoarding disorder\n",
      "Interviewee: So why they might not why they might not?\n",
      "P1: Why they might\n",
      "Interviewee: Uhuh well okay so I mean the obvious one would be because their forced to by some outside entities and I think that can be very concrete you may be evicted um your landlord is making you do this um you just discovered half of your floor has been eaten away by termites and you have to have they house fumigated and you can’t because your stuff is in there so really concrete serious things all the was to subtle things um kind of uh carrots if you will like ‘my daughter said she wont let me play with the grandkids anymore’ um or you know I I have a new boyfriend and I'm embarrassed to like bring him to my house so these theses external um you know reinforces again I think they range from really kind of concrete severe um things that could happen but then they range to more subtle features as well um those are I think they main reasons I think that people come in but then there are other ones too like ‘I'm worried what will happen to my stuff when I die’ that’s another reason I think that people come in um and I think those are kind of the main reasons\n",
      "P1: Okay\n",
      "P2: Okay\n",
      "P1: So with that we can get started with the interview and kind of the first thing we like to as everyone is uh what’s your background related to hoarding disorder and what’s your educational background and your past\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah one thing where that’s different I think like the one exception for that is that we have a lot of patients that are really worried about like the environment and not wanting to be wasteful but its its not tied to the specific object but it's more because they have a really strong belief that to be good citizens of this world\n",
      "P2: And they might have more INAUDIBLE (1:38:14) something will happen if I let this object go\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "P1: Yeah okay um so now there’s another question that we kind of already discussed about uh postdoc reasons and um something else that you’ve already mentioned that is another question that we wanted to ask is do you think that cultural forces that associating back to values and self worth consumption and material possessions play any role in the development of hoarding disorder what kind of role do you think that plays?\n",
      "Interviewee: Ah man I don’t know I don’t know I think it obviously has to be part of it and you know as the world is changing but you know hold on let me give you guys an example of why I always get stuck on this um I was speaking with a woman who just completed a stent with doctors without borders and so she's working in like rural Ethiopia and this woman came to her clinic and was um crying and really really upset and was like ‘nobody can help me with my husband’ um and and it’s the way that it works in that part of Ethiopia two level homes and basement the ground floor is where all the animals would stay at night so all the goats and what not wouldn’t be picked off by wild animals um so then the family lives up on the second level and so with one woman went on to describe the fact that her husband is collecting all sorts of like containers and like extra clothing pieces and potential building supplies and like all of this stuff that when it was described to me sounds sure a lot like what my patients tend to acquire um and collect and save um and and he basically filed the entire bottom level of their home and so the reason she was upset was that they had already had like three of their goats killed because they were no longer within the protection of the of the home and so is is because of materialism?\n",
      "When you obviously have to have access to stuff right so but we live in a world where even if your on like a deserted island you could start to collect coconut shells or whatever I don’t know I I don’t know I don’t know not a concrete answer but I think that’s the big question that we have\n",
      "Interviewer: You like that?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I do because I think you can do a lot with that as far as the chaos that’s going on in their mind you could really illustrate that you know sometimes a conflict.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, the second choice we have is vector art which is um more limited in terms of like the cartoony style um which I think is a style that you would see commonly a lot on those explain YouTube videos they have kind a like approach as well.\n",
      "And the then last one is um kind of looking more at a comic art style which kind of relates to also [32:24] __ what we were discussing superheroes as well as having some more of these this type of, the picture is probably describe it better than I could um in terms of like the coloring um.\n",
      "Between these three, is there a style that stands out to you?\n",
      "Speaker: This one.\n",
      "Interviewer: The line art.\n",
      "Speaker: Hands down.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I think so too.\n",
      "Speaker: Definitely not the third one.\n",
      "Interviewer: Definitely not the third one.\n",
      "Speaker: Throw that one away.\n",
      "Interviewer: Throw that one away…\n",
      "Do you think that’s something that’s um would be maybe dependent on the kid’s age?\n",
      "Speaker: It certainly could, but I don’t know the first thing I think of is kind of like what you said earlier it’s like um you know are we taking this seriously or are we making fun of it, or what are we doing here.\n",
      "It’s confusing and very stimulating and like I don’t know.\n",
      "That’s just not…\n",
      "Speaker: It’s like you’re almost, like you’re almost being dumbed down like you feel like it.\n",
      "33:20: Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Like you’re not taking it seriously.\n",
      "I see what you are saying.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know as an adult I know how it makes me feel and I’m thinking for a child that’s yeah I don’t.\n",
      "My son would probably be like are they trying to make fun of like this is weird, why are they doing this.\n",
      "I think it would confuse him.\n",
      "Yeah, that’s just me I like this the best.\n",
      "Interviewer: Awesome!\n",
      "Um in terms of a setting, do you guys have an idea on where they should talk?\n",
      "So you have places at home, we have school, a doctor’s office, you have the outdoors, anything else like what kind of comes to mind?\n",
      "Speaker: Like what settings?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah like what setting?\n",
      "It could be one setting, it could be multiple settings.\n",
      "What are your thoughts on um what we should do in terms of that?\n",
      "Speaker: Multiple settings, like what would occur in their daily lives like school would be a part of it you know like these little things can show the little thoughts going on in their head as they are confronted with different things you know that might bother them through the day um, and I mean um like for my son you know recess what would happen during recess maybe something might you know disturb him there or just I don’t know.\n",
      "Speaker: Well maybe extracurricular things like if they are involved in sports or music after school you know because certainly that’s the end of the day and that’s when everybody symptoms are getting worse even..\n",
      "34: 54 Speaker: Oh yeah when they are coming home from school.\n",
      "Speaker: Homework, it’s like the armpit of the day.\n",
      "Um so yeah maybe extracurriculars, sports um other than that or whatever they happen in ballet class or whatever happens in the other three mentioned.\n",
      "I can’t imagine anything else that would really be um maybe from a Tourette syndrome standpoint trying to be quiet in a quiet place like a movie theatre, church…\n",
      "Speaker: Library.\n",
      "Speaker: Library, yeah um you know a play, a planetarium.\n",
      "These are all real challenges for these kids because they can’t just.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you came out of your house and sold your house, was that distressing for you?\n",
      "Did you have a hard time with that?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "It was very tough.\n",
      "To this day I think I left stuff behind I think I should've brought with me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you think about it?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I went back, I went to Golden, I went back to visit a neighbor that we had, lat time I was there.\n",
      "There's my house.\n",
      "Well, it was my house, it's not longer my house.\n",
      "Visit the neighbor across the street, nice guy.\n",
      "He got older [women 00:35:33] buts till looking.\n",
      "He can't pay the bank rates anymore, he doesn't have the lease for it.\n",
      "But anyway, the garage door happened to be opened, I looked in the garage, and there's ... A lot of my stuff is still there.\n",
      "The bench I had made was still there, the yellow cage metal cabinet I had was still there.\n",
      "I could see a lot of my stuff was still there in the garage and somebody else was using it.\n",
      "So I kind of felt like I wish I was using it but I'm kind of happy as I recognized, it was being used.\n",
      "So it's mixed emotions.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So you still think about the stuff that you left behind and some of it you wished you'd brought but it helped a little bit to see that it was still in use, but also and at the same time you wish that you had brought it with you.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Kind of.\n",
      "If I really had my wishes I'd still be healthy and happy in Golden.\n",
      "My wife would be happy and healthy and around people and we would be one of these old couples wondering around that everybody giggles at [crosstalk 00:36:34].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's so tough.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:36:34] sick reality is [inaudible 00:36:34].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, it sounds like you are doing very well for yourself given the cards that have been dealt you.\n",
      "It sounds like you really have a community there too between your family and then the Senior Center, which is nice.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "It is, it really is.\n",
      "I feel blessed to be here.\n",
      "Didn't have anything like that in Golden [inaudible 00:36:51] and I'm encouraged of couse every the most [inaudible 00:36:56] things change.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:36:59] hard to [inaudible 00:37:00] back to work for about a year and a half before we both gave up, I was an engineer for him and I had to go back and look at the work they'd done on my file so I couldn't literally quite understand how they'd done this or that.\n",
      "The only thing that made me giggle was they ended up splitting my department in half hiring three men to take my place.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I guess that's a compliment when they have to hire three people to replace you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's kind of this idea of need and if you or someone else will need it?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Yes, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "On the other side of that question, what is trash for you?\n",
      "What do you discard and how do you know when it's time to get rid of something?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Wow, that's a good question.\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "Plastic.\n",
      "I had this thing that I don't like anymore plastic.\n",
      "I did live with a person for four months, it was everything has to be in plastic, and I was just like, \"No.\n",
      "I'm not going to buy or use any of the one time use plastic if I can help it.\"\n",
      "What's the other thing?\n",
      "I know the plastic is the main thing.\n",
      "There's got to be something else.\n",
      "I'll come up with it.\n",
      "Probably anything that's really outdated.\n",
      "I have correspondence from 30 years ago.\n",
      "It's ridiculous.\n",
      "Somebody handed me stuff that was mine from 30 years ago.\n",
      "I said, \"Wait a minute.\"\n",
      "That's not good.\n",
      "I'd rather be mobile and not have that stuff follow me around.\n",
      "I guess anything outdated and totally irrelevant.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you say irrelevant like outdate, is that like outdated clothes, appliances or just like is something that's not necessarily useful to you anymore?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Well, I say I'm writing a book about my life, then I don't get very far, because it's based on letters I lost, letters I got back, letters I wrote, and letters somebody found and sent back to me.\n",
      "It doesn't get...\n",
      "Some of that stuff from 30 years ago, I think it probably just has to go out the window and into the garbage, but there it is.\n",
      "I think, yeah, but it's going in the book.\n",
      "I'm going to write the book.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's kind of this like you're torn between keeping something because it's for a project, but it's kind of been around so long that it's not necessarily valuable anymore.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Someone else in line, I couldn't believe it.\n",
      "Why did you save that?\n",
      "Then I thought, \"Well, let's examine it.\"\n",
      "It something I need help with and I don't have a clue really about...\n",
      "Maybe it's a calming effect when I can go through something and say this is how I was before, this is a letter of proof that I did this and I did that.\n",
      "Maybe I just convince myself that it need not be garbage.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Out of every single item, what is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Oh my goodness.\n",
      "That's a hard question.\n",
      "I have lost a lot of stuff, because I gave up that one house.\n",
      "I said it's just stuff.\n",
      "\"Just stuff.\"\n",
      "I did say that a lot.\n",
      "Now that people keep everything in their phone, it's almost like the phone is becoming...\n",
      "Because I can put a document in the phone and I can put a date, a time and something, wherever I assume it's gone, and I can keep the context, the list, the date, and times in the phone so I hate to say it, but I think it's becoming the phone.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Honestly, that's quite modern times, I think many people would say that too.\n",
      "What would happen if you lost your phone?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "I've done that.\n",
      "It was like cutting your arm off.\n",
      "I was like, \"Wait a minute, where's my phone.\"\n",
      "I had to get through that and cross the bridge when I came to it and make an order, go order a phone and the whole thing, report it, cut it down, shut it down, pray to get it back.\n",
      "It wasn't so long, but it was very torturous.\n",
      "Now I understand when people tell me that they're going through something like that.\n",
      "I really understand it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "Let's say you had to choose between your phone or your gardening or something like that.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "How would I choose?\n",
      "You mean time use or use of item or how would I choose?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Something has to go, how would you choose which item?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Something has to go.\n",
      "Shoot.\n",
      "I might need to consult somebody.\n",
      "I might need help with that.\n",
      "I'd have to call up somebody and say, \"Look, be ruthless with me and tell me what has to go.\"\n",
      "An outside observer who's objective would be helpful with that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's interesting.\n",
      "This next section is going to be like distinguishing hoarding disorder and ideas of what it actually means to be diagnosed with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between someone with normal saving behavior and someone with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "What are the differences?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Let me think about that.\n",
      "One difference might be... I think a distinguishing mark might be when it's ongoing and doesn't get better.\n",
      "It's hanging on.\n",
      "It's lingering.\n",
      "The person is kind of judged by your friends and family like you're not trying hard enough, but it's actually kind of putting all your energy into it and you're actually trying, but it looks like you're not trying.\n",
      "People are saying, \"Wait a minute.\"\n",
      "That might be true.\n",
      "When it's ongoing is the main thing I can think of.\n",
      "Interviewee: That’s hard.\n",
      "I don’t determine value in any concrete way.\n",
      "Some of it is you ask the patient about what they think the real value of it is, and that gives you an assessment of insight in addition to assessment of value.\n",
      "But actual value can be assessed, and I do assess it using cultural norms.\n",
      "For example, junk mail for most people in the society that we live in would have no actual value.\n",
      "Sentimental value is something that’s a little harder to assess, and it’s harder to apply cultural norms, and so some of it is volume, some of it is the person’s own thought about how sentimental something is or isn’t.\n",
      "But the value is tricky, actual value is tricky, because it’s not just monetary.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Another phrase, “difficulty discarding possessions results in accumulation that congests and clutters active living spaces.”\n",
      "I know that we’ve talked about this.\n",
      "Does home size play into this at all?\n",
      "Interviewee: Home size does play into it.\n",
      "Although you’ll find that people who really have hoarding disorder will fill up almost all of the spaces regardless of the size of their home, and I think what… There’s two things that matter, home size is one.\n",
      "In a single room occupancy hotel you’re going to have more trouble with clutter than you are if you live in a mansion.\n",
      "That said, the difficulty discarding is still the issue, and means rather than home size, I think, is the biggest problem.\n",
      "People who don’t have means may, even if they live in a big space, still have clutter because they don’t have the means to organize it, put it away, hide it.\n",
      "They don’t, you know… People who have means may do better in organizing things, putting them away out of sight, etcetera.\n",
      "Some of that is insight.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah, it's hard to remember that.\n",
      "I see what you're saying is that you're writing at home, you're not that social so to you it hasn't really affected you at all?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it affected your hoarding in the way of discarding?\n",
      "Have you been discarding more, have you been discarding less?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It has.\n",
      "It has, because I really am home 24/7 or whatever the expression is.\n",
      "I'm becoming more aware of stuff that I don't need that surrounds me and I have begun to slowly get rid of some things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "That sounds like a positive thing from COVID.\n",
      "What about your acquiring habits, do you acquire a lot, do you buy a lot of stuff?\n",
      "Do you-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I hardly buy anything.\n",
      "Books have been the thing that I have acquired most recently and for the last 20 years.\n",
      "I have to be one of Amazon's best customers.\n",
      "It just has gotten to a point now that so many of my books that I've purchased, I haven't read and now I'm beginning to realize that I'm never going to be able to read them.\n",
      "Always before, I would say, \"Oh, you know, I'm going to take a whole year off and read all these books.\"\n",
      "Well, it's getting to the point now I realize that I don't have that time left.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "So I'm not buying books.\n",
      "I buy one or two.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You're noticing that before you kind of had this potential to read things or go through things but now you're having realization that you might not have the time to get to all those things after all.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Do you think COVID has affected your sense of connectiveness or attachment to your items or is it pretty much the same?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Well, it's kind of, but it's not COVID per se, it's just that I'm getting older and I have enough nice things and we have, we're both as I said, readers and have bought a lot of books in our time, but not crappy books.\n",
      "Books we buy are very scholarly or are the best literary fiction that is written.\n",
      "Our books are really good books.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Interviewee: Well so who do I think about who is in our trial and who is in our research protocols it is older females who are sterility educated but economically lower SEF\n",
      "P2: Mhm\n",
      "Interviewee: They tend to be like higher levels of loneliness like maybe they have um a few core group friends but there are interpersonal relationships that you maybe would typically expect that they no longer have so perhaps estranged from family and what not um they tend to be white do I think that those are only\n",
      "Interviewee: are they more located in the country?\n",
      "Interviewee: What was that?\n",
      "P2: Are they more located in cities or uh suburbs or the country?\n",
      "Interviewee: No I think they are everywhere and I mean that defiantly comes from my I mean we would like in CITY (53:35) hoarding patients would come out of the woodwork like you would advertise for like a washing study and you would have all these hoarding patients um a I’ve had a harder time recruiting hoarding down here in CITY (53:49) than I have anywhere else and I think part of that has to do with that our city is over sixty-five percent Latino\n",
      "P2: Hm\n",
      "Interviewee: And do I think that we don’t have hoarding in those populations?\n",
      "I don’t think so I don’t think that that’s the answer I think it has to do with perception issue you know a lot of these like first generation or even second generation lets say let's take the Cuban immigrants for example they have fought tooth and nail for what they have and now I'm going to come in a tell them that it’s a problem that they can’t move easily through their home of course they are going to be resistant to that they are not going to self identify with that so I think there a big part of that um I I think that we don’t understand enough about what hoarding looks like in other ethnicities and then certainly also from what we know of um the epidemiology studies is that there is no gender difference and if I focus on my young adults there is no gender difference so somewhere in there\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (55:17) seek treatment yeah\n",
      "Interviewee: All the dudes are getting lost\n",
      "P2: Mhm\n",
      "Interviewee: But it's not just seeking treatment like that’s why I keep emphasizing like not just our treatment study but also our research protocol in both of those places we see primarily females older females\n",
      "P2: So do you think that’s a that’s a question with insight or identifying as a person with a problem with clutter or hoarding do you think it’s a higher level of stigma?\n",
      "Interviewee: All of the above probably right and then I think there’s probably another factor which is that I mean don’t know maybe more of these dudes are like living with partners who are cleaning up after them and basically keeping the clutter at bay?\n",
      "I don’t know\n",
      "P2: Interesting um so I just want to bring this up because uh I I don’t want us to get crunched for time I know we can talk up until 12:30 and we both want to be respectful of your time but I think that probably we’re not going to be able to make it through all of our questions and I'm wondering if it's possible to uh just get as far as we get and the schedule another time with you to to continue or follow up?\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure we can do that\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How have you coped with COVID?\n",
      "You said that you're not that social so maybe you haven't experienced feeling isolated or neglected from not having as much social interaction, would you say that's true?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Since I don't socialize it really hasn't impacted me at all.\n",
      "What does impact me about COVID is watching the T.V. news.\n",
      "That will make me depressed but it's not the type of depression that incapacitates me, I just feel very low and very unhappy for the people who are either losing loved ones due to the virus or just the circumstances that they have to accept because of somebody in their family that has COVID.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "It's the T.V., kind of the media, has maybe had more of an effect on you negatively?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How have you dealt with that?\n",
      "Do you just stop watching it now?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "No. I'll watch it but if it's really hard to take I'll just get up and leave the room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How about your-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "NAME watches the news.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I was going to ask how about your partner, how does she feel similarly about COVID or is she a little more-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "No, she's been affected more by it because she sings in a church choir.\n",
      "She doesn't go to church because she's a church goer, she goes because she loves to sing.\n",
      "She belongs to the church choir and they, all these choir members are interesting since the church doesn't convene they really missed the singing so they have been meeting up in a parking lot or some place up at the church and singing in the evenings.\n",
      "They social distance and they stand out there and sing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, that's nice, at least.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Things like that.\n",
      "And she's involved with refugees that have settled in our community.\n",
      "It used to be that she took these people to go grocery shopping or to go to where they could get free foods and stuff and now she's pretty much, not pretty much, she does it by herself because they know who she is and who she's getting the food for, and then she just leaves the bags of food at the front door of the houses where these people live.\n",
      "So, it's affected her more because of her involvement in the community than it has me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha, because she's more community involved, more social, it's affected her more.\n",
      "You kind of doing your same sort of gig per usual?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "I think mostly from family friends, from being in my 26 year marriage to someone that I had to ask repeatedly to move things, to get help, and the person said, \"No, I was raised this way.\n",
      "I have to accumulate.\"\n",
      "I would fight that battle.\n",
      "I would say, \"I see, okay, you don't want to clean it up.\n",
      "You can't do it.\"\n",
      "Finding out that his father and also people on the paternal side were that way, I said, \"This is what this is.\"\n",
      "Trying not to example it too much to your daughters, but sometimes of course doing so.\n",
      "Yeah, lots of familiarity with everybody struggling with it basically.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When you think about...\n",
      "What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "I think insecure person, needs some help, and I think it's tough.\n",
      "I feel sympathy, because I know it's tough.\n",
      "I think that person is having a tough time, and it's not an easy win-win situation where you have a sense of resolution.\n",
      "That's what I usually... I mean I've been hired by one lady to help her, but I began to see it was almost to help her so yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "When she hired you, was she a friend that wanted help or how did she find you?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "She was a person who hid it well, that was a contact in the community I used to live in, in the north east of Gainesville, and she said nothing about her collection.\n",
      "She said, \"I need help moving, I'm a renting a truck later.\n",
      "I'll rent a pod and a shed, and I'll put everything outside.\n",
      "I have an elderly relative, I'm alone, I can't do this.\n",
      "I'll pay you to take my hidden things and my visible things and all my things.\"\n",
      "I didn't know how important they were to her.\n",
      "Then recently I volunteered to clean someone's apartment and that was another experience.\n",
      "I got there, we knew this man, but we didn't know the man kept multiple items that belonged to his mother and multiple antiques and multiple furniture and multiple clothes.\n",
      "We didn't know till we go there.\n",
      "It was the same, I thought, \"Well, this is what it looks like when you don't get help and you're 67 years old and you've been collecting your whole life.\"\n",
      "It's sad and it's unmanageable and it actually makes other people very mad I learned.\n",
      "In fact, I took some of his stuff.\n",
      "I said, \"What am I doing?\n",
      "Well, I need this.\"\n",
      "It sounds funny now, but at the time they were like, \"Wait a minute.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That kind of leads perfectly into our next section which is discussing distress in regards to your behavior.\n",
      "It sounds like your behavior upsets you.\n",
      "Do you think it's getting in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "And she says, \"No, and if you open the closet door you'll just see more magazines.\n",
      "I [inaudible 00:29:31].\"\n",
      "And that's to me an example of ... I could really say, \"Yes, it's my Aunt Helen.\n",
      "She's my father's younger sister.\n",
      "My father's younger brother is able recognize this place.\n",
      "Subsequent to in Alex.\n",
      "it's a whole another story.\n",
      "There's a nice lady called Dr. Rhonda Patrick, she's in a different fied of science than you are.\n",
      "She's [inaudible 00:29:59] and herself a research scientist down in California and she encouraged people like me to get the DNA test because she had done a tool help to check your DNA for propensities.\n",
      "She'll do her primary research with nutrition, and health [agents 00:30:18].\n",
      "To make a long story short, I did it and sure enough going back to Prometheus, which is a little different service than hers, yep, I got that and... I have a younger brother who has the same problem.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:30:33] California.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you know that it is genetic because everybody in your family seems to have problems with it.\n",
      "Have you noticed in his children?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:30:45] people, yes, ma'am, for sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel you ever met anybody outside of your family where you thought they might have this problem or you suspected that they might have this problem?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "No, ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever seen-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:31:05].\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "You got to give an example of where it's a problem because my brother ...\n",
      "It doesn't matter.\n",
      "You probably don't even-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no. Go ahead.\n",
      "Please give me the example.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "So my brother has a house in Turlock, and his wife left him.\n",
      "He can be nasty.\n",
      "He's nastier than I am sometimes.\n",
      "Sometimes [inaudible 00:31:21] or we go to visit him, he's got this nice table he and his wife had.\n",
      "You could seat 12 people, at it sort of entertain for the church there were a lot of people over.\n",
      "He had this so full stuff that's the stuff he keeps on the horizontal surfaces, that there's only room for him to sit from this good light to read.\n",
      "If I want to sit there and eat a meal with him, or read a book or something.\n",
      "There's no room for it.\n",
      "So we get to fight over the one space that's open to sit and read.\n",
      "It's [inaudible 00:31:59].\n",
      "So I don't visit him anymore, for other reasons but that's one of them.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:32:07] I'm not quite that bad or not that far either.\n",
      "When I was is Golden, I was living by myself.\n",
      "My kitchen counter was so cluttered with stuff.\n",
      "You could put something down, and disappear into it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "People would comment about that, but I did keep the kitchen table open enough that a few people could sit there if needed.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Look at my [inaudible 00:37:28] that's what I was.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How has-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:37:32].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, how has your life been impacted by COVID?\n",
      "Can you talk to me about that?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "So it's been impacted about as much as some.\n",
      "I've remained in the [even 00:37:45] section.\n",
      "Which means, what's impacted me the most is restrictions on where I can go and what I can do.\n",
      "There are a lot more of these in Texas, are pretty much voluntary.\n",
      "If you want to be a good citizen you'll wear a mask.\n",
      "If you don't want to be a good citizen you don't have to.\n",
      "You walk around and talk to people you can talk to.\n",
      "And I don't want that [inaudible 00:38:09] that's impacted me a bit.\n",
      "Where it's really impacted the very most though is I used to help spend time[inaudible 00:38:16] A used book store, a walk away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Over here, What I really get done here, I think it's a combined Harris County Public Library.\n",
      "Combined Lone Star Community College library, it's one building on the Lone Star community college campus there're other campuses in this library [inaudible 00:38:43] Library selections and there's a used book store there run by friends of the library, so people can donate their used books.\n",
      "We try and sell the used books[inaudible 00:38:56] I'll take it to the library.\n",
      "So, it gives me great satisfaction for books that are no longer loved or room for it to place in your [inaudible 00:39:05] We take them in there, we sell them and we get money to help run the library.\n",
      "Feel real good abut that, I really like using the library because I can change a book, give it back to them I've got more reason to give I can't find them in here.\n",
      "I had literally thousands of books in my basement, I used to be a ferocious reader.\n",
      "I don't read like I used to, I'm not nearly as fast, my comprehension is down, my retention is down.\n",
      "But I used to really read.\n",
      "Still like to read, but it's not the joy that it was.\n",
      "Anyway, I still hear about the cause of the problem such, to know the martian closed down the library, book stores and [inaudible 00:39:54].\n",
      "And it's not there just makes it inconvenient, [virtually 00:40:04] it's still there but it's not open for anybody.\n",
      "The library is still closed.\n",
      "So that [inaudible 00:40:04] out to be my...There's the senior center, friends are looking at old movies, talk to people we had exercise classes all the other stuff that goes on at the Senior Center.\n",
      "Now it's open again but it's not like it was back down there, it sure was my habitat.[crosstalk 00:40:24] to be there as much as anything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel like COVID has impacted your clutter or your hoarding problems at all?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Do I know somebody who's gotten better?\n",
      "Just a few friends and family that I've felt have gotten a bit better at their hoarding goals stuff.\n",
      "I'm not sure.\n",
      "It actually helps someone else and in helping someone else, it helps me.\n",
      "That was the only thing that helped me, because I would be able to see, \"Oh, look what she did.\n",
      "She gathered like 55 oil paintings and then she had nowhere to put them, and she put them in her shed.\n",
      "She asked me to help her clean out the shed and I went, 'Uh-oh.'\" When you help someone else put the trust into collecting, gathering, you say, \"Oh, wait a minute, I do the same thing.\n",
      "Maybe I need some help.\"\n",
      "It's helpful and you can see the difference only when you see somebody with a worse problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How would you...\n",
      "Sorry, what?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "That's the only time I can see the difference.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you say hoarding disorder looks like?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Similar to your question earlier, except...\n",
      "Let me think.\n",
      "It doesn't mean that it's just appearance related, because it's on the inside to.\n",
      "It's like an emotional.\n",
      "I know what it is.\n",
      "It's an emotional...\n",
      "This one lady told me that with her it was purely emotional.\n",
      "She just had to have it.\n",
      "She just had to have several antiques.\n",
      "I don't have pure emotions about several antiques, but I have... I think it's inside the person and I think it's in me too, trying to show up something and they're trying to have several things, because there's a scarcity, for lack of a better word, there's a feeling of scarcity.\n",
      "Oh, no, I don't have this so therefore I better have three or four or five this go.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Kind of going back, this is similar to the question that i asked for, and this next one is going to be too to see if you had time to think about it, is there a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I think probably no, probably not, because it's easy to sort of hide your extra stuff I think if you're not a person carrying things about.\n",
      "I used to carry a little, not too much with me.\n",
      "I still do that though, but yeah, I always think I'm going to get stuck somewhere that I need at least two things to read.\n",
      "Yeah, I think the answer is probably pretty much no. You can't guess, because it's their stuff, without it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It seems like you kind of know a little bit about hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Where have you gotten information about it from?\n",
      "041\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so before we get started, as you know, this study's investigating individuals' attitudes and beliefs related to having a hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Our first question is, what term would you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and difficulties discarding?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "\"Clutter.\"\n",
      "\"Clutter.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "\"Clutter?\" Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:00:19] and \"clutter.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "The first part is going to be demographics.\n",
      "They're not really interesting questions, but they're just going to be simple.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Oh, I'm familiar.\n",
      "It's fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Female, and I identify as female.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then your racial identification?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Black.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and then do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "No. Just black.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Then what was your highest degree or level of education you've completed?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Master's degree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then what is your household income?\n",
      "You can say it in a range.\n",
      "It doesn't have to be exact.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "For myself?\n",
      "I mean I live with family, but I am a student again.\n",
      "I'm starting nursing school, so I don't have income.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that's fine.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I live with family, so ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Which geographic region best describes where you live in the US?\n",
      "So we have northeast-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Florida.\n",
      "South.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "South?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "And I live in Florida.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right, awesome.\n",
      "So this next section of the interview is more conversation-style.\n",
      "It's broken into a few different segments of topics relating to clutter-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:08:19].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So this first one is behavior and treatment-seeking.\n",
      "If you could please describe your clutter problems and how long they've been going on?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Since college, so like 2006.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:08:49], yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you say it started when you graduated college or during college?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "During because I started college in 2006.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How severe would you say your behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I think it's very mild.\n",
      "The worst it ever got was last year.\n",
      "Yeah, last year.\n",
      "For two, three months, I had a lot of stuff, so it was trouble to walk around, but for the majority of my life, it's been organized but just not being able to find things.\n",
      "It wasn't messy where you couldn't walk around; it's just, I have a lot of containers to put things in, and everything was in a container, but it wasn't like like-with-like items.\n",
      "It was like I would have pens one place, [inaudible 00:09:45] one place ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think your behavior is a problem?\n",
      "Why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "The most precious...that's a good question.\n",
      "I don't know if I have one that I hold above the others.\n",
      "I mean I would say one thing that I really like is my ticket stub collection because it's relatively small.\n",
      "It used to be relatively complete I don't worry about it quite as much anymore but I guess that's one type of memory thing that I can relive.\n",
      "I'll tell you something funny about that.\n",
      "I bought a small book and I put my ticket stubs in and I only went maybe four years into my ticket stubs and, many of them, if you'd asked me if I'd seen this particular event I would have said nah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you don't even remember.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah so I don't even have the memory that I wanted to retrieve.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "But that's kind of funny.\n",
      "I don't know it's that's in terms of... I actually did sell some ticket stubs for $500 each, believe it or not.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "This was a number of years ago and they probably over paid and I don't know if the market is still that good but one of my friends had tickets to a similar show and I sold two for her for $500 each too.\n",
      "I could probably give you a smallish list of my collections but I don't know which one I would put higher than the others.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well I mean, that's good.\n",
      "You did give an example that you do like a lot.\n",
      "Going back to the ticket stubs and all that, what would happen if you lost it?\n",
      "Would it be a traumatic event or would you be okay?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No I don't think it would.\n",
      "I think at this point I'd be sad.\n",
      "I don't think it would be a tragedy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I think one reason I'd be sad is because I didn't sell them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the loss of the money would be upsetting.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The loss of the money would be upsetting but other than that [crosstalk 00:30:30] you'd be okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah, you know I do focus on that to some extent because of the experience of doing things like that.\n",
      "Can I give you one more hoarding success story?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I'm going to say when I was maybe 10 years old, I could have been younger, I got a... there was some kind of Bullwinkle club item.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Do you know Rocky and Bullwinkle?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay, good, you're a real [inaudible 00:31:09] kid.\n",
      "So it was some Bullwinkle secret marching society or something it came in an eight by 10 envelope, there were maybe 10 pieces of paper in there, I'm not sure how many.\n",
      "And early in my eBay career I sold that envelope of 10 pieces of paper for $200.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "P1: Yeah so um just to go ahead and get started we want we have a little informed consent that we just like to uh read to you before we get started with the actual interview so you’re volunteering to participate in a research project conducted by NAME (10:23) at UNIVERSITY (10:26) um you’re going to be one of about thirty or so people participating in the research your participation is voluntary um and there are no direct benefit to you in participating, the biggest risk in participating is a violation of confidentiality you may withdraw or discontinue participation at any time without penalty and if you declined to participate in the study no one will be told um if you feel uncomfortable during the interview session you have the right to decline to answer any question at all or end the interview uh the interview will last about sixty minutes and notes will be taken and an audio recording and dialog a subsequent transcription of the dialog will be made if you don’t want to be recorded you will not be able to participate in the study um all information that could identify you in the transcription will be removed and the audio recording will be destroyed after transcription occurs uh the researchers will not identify you by name in any reports use any information obtained from this interview and your confidentiality as a participant will remain secure um these precautions will prevent your comments from having any negative reproductions on you.\n",
      "Do you have any questions about that at this time?\n",
      "Interviewee: No\n",
      "P2: And then the second part of the interview is very free form and will just be a conversation I probably should have explained that to you before we got started but um yeah so we’ll do one more this and then we'll move on and get to talk in a little more detail about all of this I'm really excited to hear what you're about to say I don’t know uh just because you’ve already kind of jumped into the issues that we really want to hit on\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah like I said I'm really not not doing your lists very well i'll be better with this next one (laughing)\n",
      "P2: That’s okay that’s okay\n",
      "P1: Um before we go to the last one is there anything else you wanted to add to to ways that a person could identify someone you know you mentioned the clutter the strong attachment to objects and extreme disorganization and then um a sense of optimism or potential that may or may not be present\n",
      "Interviewee: Once again that one I wouldn’t I would not put on a diagnostic list it's just something that I think about with these patients a lot so the other thing is also like a squishy thing and it has to do with the way they talk so there’s that INAUDIBLE (31:25) that not quite as severe its not at all as severe as you would see with someone with psychosis but you know they fact that everything takes longer with these patients including having them complete a structured interview um is interesting it’s not diagnostic but it's something that is very salient to me about these patients\n",
      "P1: Mhm yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s great.\n",
      "And the second one was educational.\n",
      "So if you think of a picture, a vision in your mind of what that would look like?\n",
      "Speaker: Educational there would be… just the joy of acknowledging things that were so clear.\n",
      "You know things going back to like the briefcase, you know if the handle was crooked my son would concentrate on why the handle was crooked instead of everything else that was going on.\n",
      "When he got passed that he was aware of things and it was very nice to see him not worrying about the crooked handle on the briefcase.\n",
      "So it was very, it was educational to me because I never knew that his problem was stuck on the little things that concerned him.\n",
      "Because I didn’t really understand OCD\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "So with that being said, your last word was overjoyed.\n",
      "How would overjoyed look?\n",
      "Speaker: Again a little boy is sitting with the little caption above him going “Wow” because being focused on what he was focused on, he wasn’t focused on anything else.\n",
      "It would be joy.\n",
      "Interviewer: Joy that sounds great.\n",
      "The goal of CBT is to reduce anxiety.\n",
      "If someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life, what would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: If anxiety became a problem?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, if someone asked you how anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life, what would you say?\n",
      "Speaker: It’s in everyone’s life, constantly anxiety is there.\n",
      "How we overcome anxiety is the problem.\n",
      "I mean when someone cuts you off on the road, you know you get anxious and wonder when the next person will come in.\n",
      "It shouldn’t interfere with what you have to do, but it does.\n",
      "Interviewer: So based on that answer, what is important for other patients to know about that?\n",
      "Speaker: Anxiety is always there you know it has to dealt with and it has to be able to come quickly, as far as I’m concerned.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you tell me if there are any specific skills or areas that CBT targets?\n",
      "Speaker: I just know it held my son back on dealing with certain problems because he was stuck on what he was looking at.\n",
      "I really don’t know how to answer that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So do you feel like CBT targets a patients thoughts, feelings, or actions?\n",
      "The cognitive behavioral therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "I mean no actions are wrong however anxiety gets you stuck and there’s no action.\n",
      "I don’t know that much about it, I can say it’s a result because of my son.\n",
      "Interviewer: So that being said, are there any questions you wish you’d asked before starting CBT sessions?\n",
      "Speaker: I wish, the first day I wish I could’ve said is this really going to work.\n",
      "But as it went on, I got to see that it works and how it works.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So are there any other questions, other than that, that you wanted to ask before you started CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: I wanted to ask; yes I mean I wanted to ask why so many different therapists had to be part of it.\n",
      "I didn’t know that because when I had therapy in my life it was always with one person, not a whole group.\n",
      "And the group was really good because they had different ways of going about it, explaining it.\n",
      "And ways of dealing with it.\n",
      "But they all hit the focal point and it was amazing.\n",
      "Interviewer: So what was your involvement in the CBT treatment?\n",
      "What would be useful for other parents to know?\n",
      "But more importantly with the first question, what was your involvement in your son’s treatment?\n",
      "Speaker: I got a clear sight of what was wrong with him.\n",
      "I didn’t see it as clear as what the therapist was showing.\n",
      "When he was getting stuck and when he just had to move on.\n",
      "And I didn’t know that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So is there a way of doing that in which you don’t scare off the parents?\n",
      "Speaker: Umm I don’t think you can… scare off the parents because you have to do it.\n",
      "You have to I mean what are you going to do?\n",
      "Not do it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right\n",
      "Speaker: I mean… just oh well that’s too scary I’m not, that’s too much work.\n",
      "I’m not going to do it.\n",
      "My kid is not that worth it.\n",
      "No, you are going to do it, you know.\n",
      "You have to but at least you know, you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah ok.\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense and talking about um the parent video um one option we had was talking about what parents can and can’t do to help.\n",
      "Is that something that should be discussed in these videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: What they can and can’t do to help like while we are here?\n",
      "Or…\n",
      "Interviewer: Probably in terms of like interacting with your child, what’s useful?\n",
      "What’s not useful?\n",
      "Speaker: I think that’s good….\n",
      "Because I feel like a lot of times we do exactly the opposite of what we should do.\n",
      "We coddle them.\n",
      "Its ok you’ll be fine...umm\n",
      "Speaker: ‘I’ve learn a lot of things that I was doing yeah that were just completely counteractive and I was like…\n",
      "Speaker: Umm I don’t know what you think\n",
      "Speaker: But as a mother you tend to just yeah.\n",
      "Maybe just let them know that be prepared to break some habits.\n",
      "Be prepared for um some of your basic ideas of parenting maybe challenged, you know because it does.\n",
      "Things you thought all along you know you are making it better.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah you do not want to make it better.\n",
      "It’s like the opposite.\n",
      "Like you… It might make you sick I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Having embracing what you are learning through therapy.\n",
      "Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "I do want to go back briefly to when we talked about the parent video um in terms of we mentioned having if there was a parent focused video, the parents would probably be the stars of those.\n",
      "Would you also want kids in there for the parent videos?\n",
      "And like how would that look?\n",
      "Speaker: I would maybe um… would these be cartoons or totally definitely?\n",
      "Speaker: Don’t, for parents.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well I guess that’s the question too.\n",
      "For parents, if we are doing a parent style video would you have a preference between like these?\n",
      "Speaker: Um…\n",
      "Interviewer: or like [49:43] __.\n",
      "Speaker: I mean yeah.\n",
      "I think you know one of these is ok for the parent also but…\n",
      "Interviewer: The line art?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah but um I mean I would want to maybe see interviews of actual patients if they were willing to…\n",
      "Interviewer: For that\n",
      "Speaker: If they are willing to do it and their parents you know for the families that have gone through it and just kind of talk about their story briefly.\n",
      "I would want to see that.\n",
      "Interviewer: Anything to add.\n",
      "Speaker: Umm no I just think it’s going to be adults.\n",
      "We do not need to get all fancy.\n",
      "They just want the information\n",
      "Interviewer: information, right.\n",
      "Speaker: You know\n",
      "Interviewer: So, um overall take home message of the video, if you had to really concisely sum it all up in terms of what absolutely should be in the video, what should that be?\n",
      "Speaker1: Umm\n",
      "Speaker: [50:40] ___ …. Probably that you know um expect you are going to come in here with problems, expect a challenge, except hard-work, and hope that the outcome is you know a smoother, a more easily operating mind of a child.\n",
      "You know that there’s been significant resolution to a problem that it isn’t just let’s go to out appointment and go back to our normal day.\n",
      "That it’s going to be a lot of work for everybody.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "It's going to be difficult for both of us to get rid of our stuff and at least NAME has nephews and nieces that will inherit her things.\n",
      "I still have five living brothers and sisters and nieces but I'm completely estranged from all of them except one niece.\n",
      "My problem in COVID, it's made me think about this.\n",
      "I'm going to have to start thinking and I have started to, what am I going to do with all this stuff.\n",
      "I don't want to have a tag sale because, again, people being on my property would give me a nervous breakdown.\n",
      "Also, you're expected to sell things for just a few dollars and the kind of things that I would have to sell are not worth just a few dollars.\n",
      "I'm really in a predicament.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "COVID has made you kind of think about all your items that you have and what your plan is to get rid of them or who to give them when you pass?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Well, that's good that's kind of made you think about that.\n",
      "Has it affected your physical health or your mental health or anything like that?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Well, I normally take an antidepressant, if fact two of them, because I'm clinically depressed.\n",
      "So severely enough that if I miss my pill for whatever reason, my pills.\n",
      "then I become depressed very quickly.\n",
      "When that happens I'm almost paralyzed.\n",
      "I always make myself get out of bed, there's never been a time that I have said, \"No, I just can't face the world today.\"\n",
      "I do get up, but oh, gosh, I don't get anything done, because the attitude is, \"Why should I do anything, I'm just going to die.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "I think a lot of folks with depression struggle with that.\n",
      "That is kind of what it is, we live and we die, so what's the point, but that's nice you can be on antidepressant and seems like that probably helps.\n",
      "I don't know if this makes you feel better but a lot of, depression is the highest comorbidity with hoarding so a lot of folk that are struggling with hoarding are also depressed.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It's an interesting thing there.\n",
      "Hasn't COVID affected your family financially at all?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "No. We're both on Social Security and NAME does freelance work.\n",
      "She was a professional editor so she still does freelancing.\n",
      "I just live off of my Social Security.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you guys are good there, that's good to know.\n",
      "[crosstalk 01:04:52]\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I have Medicare and Medicaid and she has insurance carried over from her previous job.\n",
      "No, financially we're in good shape unless really something drastic in the world were to happen.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah, it is good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. This next section is going to be kind of talking about like the space and your living area.\n",
      "Can you please describe where you or how you live now?\n",
      "Do you live alone?\n",
      "What does the space kind of look like?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Today it's kind of really messy, but sometimes I get it all cleaned up.\n",
      "I have no file cabinets or anything so I have a storage and I end up making the 22 mile round trip just to go to the storage.\n",
      "How that goes is I am going to store this, wait a minute, why I am storing this?\n",
      "Why don't I just throw it away?\n",
      "Why am I paying $41 for storage?\n",
      "It's almost like really self-discrimination.\n",
      "I'll tell my daughter, \"Yes, it's just stuff, blankets, and that stuff in storage is yours.\"\n",
      "She herself tends to like gather certain things.\n",
      "I think it's usually furniture.\n",
      "What I have is like one stool, one bed, temporary guestroom, part of a closet.\n",
      "I'm not overboard on the clothing that I know of, but it's not in order like it needs to be.\n",
      "I have like the documents, the papers, the mail, the stuff I need, but I think I'm going to mail some on Tuesday.\n",
      "Yeah, carry bag, separate bag, and shopping bags so that I can think what category it is and put it away.\n",
      "I have that which is not neat.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's all in your home that you live in right now or that was in the storage unit?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "My home, yes.\n",
      "I have a temporary guestroom where I use to have a rented room and it was a little bit better.\n",
      "I'm trying to think if it was better back then.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like there's some parts of the home that you don't use.\n",
      "You don't use the guest room, because it's a storage space?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "I sleep in the one bed, one stool, one lamp room unless somebody's coming to here, which hasn't happened due to the virus I guess.\n",
      "Prior to the virus I would vacate this room if somebody needs it.\n",
      "There's an older person that's the homeowner and then there's now me in a different section in this little guest room so that's what I have.\n",
      "Actually, I did throw away some stuff.\n",
      "Some times I congratulate myself, I threw away some stuff.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "There was a contest.\n",
      "I could generate some things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You are currently living alone or are you living with other people?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "One other person.\n",
      "The homeowner person who is 79 years of age and sometimes technically has been told her health issues need to be checked on, can be the same as a person actually certianly, but I leave and come back.\n",
      "I'm not doing what you call too much quarantine, self isolating the last four weeks.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you like your home to look like if you were able to change it?\n",
      "Interviewer: What do you mean by means?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well money, insight, help, family members, etcetera.\n",
      "So I mean we certainly see people who have enough space such that their clutter is confined to one or two rooms, and then we have people who live in huge spaces in rural areas where their entire space is full of stuff.\n",
      "And there it’s that, sometimes, either they don’t have the ability themselves to move things around, the insight, the desire, there’s nobody else living with them, or they have severe hoarding.\n",
      "So space does play a part, there’s no question, but I think… and you have to take that into account when you’re looking at somebody with a big home or with a lot of space, especially when you get into that tricky zone, which is, you know, the mild to moderate level.\n",
      "Severe hoarding you’ll see in all levels of space.\n",
      "Again, the key issue is difficulty discarding, and when I see somebody who has a really big home I ask them, you know, “If there was nobody controlling your stuff, what would this house look like?” or, “In the spaces that are exclusively yours, can you use them or are there spaces that just have stuff in them that you no longer use for their intended purposes?” So sometimes people will turn bedrooms into junk rooms rather than a guest room, for example.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok\n",
      "Interviewee: And that’s ok if they go in and out and use it as a workroom, but if it’s got stuff in it and they never walk into it then that’s an indication.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Do you see differences in how much free space an individual needs to live normally?\n",
      "So, you know, what is a comfortable amount of space?\n",
      "For example, some people like to have open counters, while others prefer to have knickknacks and things.\n",
      "Could this be a similar, but more extreme difference?\n",
      "Interviewee: Not sure I follow that question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Severe.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Severe.\n",
      "Well, the one thing I don't do is food.\n",
      "Food goes out.\n",
      "Food goes in the trash or the garbage.\n",
      "You won't find...\n",
      "Well, occasionally a candy wrapper, non-sugar, sugar-less.\n",
      "But then it's handy that I can... I put a trash can at each end of the sofa, and there's a trash can in every room in the house.\n",
      "So when something needs to be thrown away, I don't have to look for a trash can.\n",
      "May sound weird, but I [inaudible 00:08:25] on, is one end of the loveseat.\n",
      "The other end is a mess.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "What's the question?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How severe would you say that overall clutter problems or hoarding disorder for you is now?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, compared to some of those things where there's old bodies and animals running around and whatever, I would say mine is moderate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Moderate.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Pardon?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I was going to say, do you believe that it's an issue or it's a problem, your clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Oh, definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And I know you mentioned that some of it is kind of some issues with space and you mentioned the back room.\n",
      "Are there any reasons-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Oh, and the original sewing room that I sort of outlined for myself when we first moved into the house.\n",
      "There are aisles of about 12 inches in a circle around the boxes, which go up about four feet in a configuration and it has fabric in it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there any other...\n",
      "Oh, sorry.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there any other reason for why clutter problem, clutter issues, I'm sorry, are a problem in your life?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Why they're a problem?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Outside of what you mentioned with space and with these aisles and your relationship with your husband.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I can generally find, generally find whatever I'm looking for.\n",
      "I don't have to go out tools and [inaudible 00:33:47] piece of fabric.\n",
      "I can generally find it.\n",
      "It may take me a while.\n",
      "I use what I call the Herod method: go and search diligently.\n",
      "I don't know what anyone else does it, but that's my religious background.\n",
      "Are you familiar with the story?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of...\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "The wise men came and asked the king, and the king said, \"Go search diligently for the young child that I may worship him also.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I thought you had said Herod; I just wasn't entirely sure.\n",
      "But yes, I am familiar with that story.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But the King James Bible and many Bibles up to a certain point use the word diligently.\n",
      "So I will search diligently.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Searching diligently for things.\n",
      "Interviewee: Um but that’s what we do with hoarding so I think that it is a huge problem in a situation like a person who lives in a studio with their partner and they have that living space cluttered up do they have more severe hoarding or less severe that the person who is rich and has fifteen storage units and two homes that they have filled up but their current home is spick and span and beautiful\n",
      "P2: Mhm\n",
      "Interviewee: INAUDIBLE (58:51)\n",
      "P2: Literally our next question was going to be for you to talk exactly about that issue so you're\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh --\n",
      "P2: Like we’re thinking along the same lines yeah so how do you how do you do that how do you decide how do you operate with that criteria and this is literally how do you do it in your practice?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah so is this like for the treatment or like our groups that we run um I'm super flexible with the clutter criterion because I just think that if somebody’s telling me that they are distressed and impaired because of their attachment to objects regardless to whether that results in clutter that is at the level the is required based on the DSM I will let them in for our research study it’s a lot more challenging um so you know because people want to know if oh you define hoarding disorder like it is in the DSM then you have to make sure that they meet that way so basically what I've been doing is doing like a shadow um definition which is to really hone in on the difficulties discarding as the kind of primary diagnostic criterion because it its and issue our field is going to have to grapple with in um and I think especially as we start to look at hoarding across the globe I think these where it's going to be particularly relevant um if you put me living in a camper trailer it's automatically going to feel more cluttered even though I'm not a cluttered person right you know then if you put me in a special you know five bedroom like mansion space and how much access we have to space is something we have to think about I don’t think there’s any clear cut answers right now and then the other diagnostic criteria I have a huge issue with um is the acquiring um so identifying acquiring as uh the specified and I just I'm just like ‘hang on a moment’ okay so we have a patient who has full blown hoarding but the don’t have acquiring so they say no to acquiring nine time out of ten those patients are either actively avoiding any sort of situation where they may be tempted to acquire or they’ve run out of money okay like they literally can’t like they are barely feeding themselves and their family um or there’s some other like kind of extenuating circumstance like I've never purchased things and then you find out all their like of our magazines disappear from that waiting groom every time that patient stops by and so I think that its is it doesn’t allow for a nuanced description of uh the acquiring issue in hoarding and just because you are avoiding something does not mean you do not have a problem with acquiring you have a really big problem with acquiring but we live in a very materialistic world so your constantly exposed to stuff so those are my two bones that I have to pick with (laughing)\n",
      "P2: With the criteria yeah what about this issue of telling hoarding from other mental health disorders so you know there are several types hoarding some of them mentioned are obsessive compulsive disorder also depression sometimes that patients get very upset\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah. I made the mistake of mentioning...\n",
      "Forget why I was in there.\n",
      "I had the key, car key in my hand, I was sitting behind the wheel of the car.\n",
      "For a short instance, I did not know what to do with that key.\n",
      "She leapt on that and made me go and take the simulation.\n",
      "I flunked.\n",
      "My eyes don't move real quick.\n",
      "Sometimes I ponder things before I do them, even though I know what it is I'm supposed to be doing.\n",
      "It's slow.\n",
      "It comes.\n",
      "It's not lost.\n",
      "But behind the wheel it could be rather dangerous.\n",
      "Another one of my very big frustrations with me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The pondering things or generally the driving?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Both.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Both.\n",
      "You said you reached out to psychiatrists, psychologists.\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change hoarding disorder behaviors in any other way?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "No. There's someone, let's see, what's the book called?\n",
      "Take [inaudible 00:17:46] Treasures.\n",
      "Treasure...\n",
      "Many Treasures, something.\n",
      "He has something where you start a small group and commiserate with each other.\n",
      "I thought about that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What, about starting a group?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "We help each other.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you ever do that or is that just something that you had thought about doing or something that you're considering doing?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Just something that crossed my mind that might be fun to do.\n",
      "But if I met here at the house, I have to figure out a place to fit.\n",
      "That would not be necessarily appropriate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It would be difficult to find a place to sit?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "In the living room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Why would it be difficult to find a place to sit?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, because the end of the sofa is filled with stuff.\n",
      "Magazines, which I might need someday and I haven't finished reading them.\n",
      "Newspapers that I want to keep.\n",
      "Not real, real old ones, but ones I haven't taken a recipe out of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "So newspapers and magazines that you might need have recipes or other information you might want?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Things that I'd like to keep handy, but they aren't handy because they're a mess, under something.\n",
      "But as far as trying to get help, I haven't done much of anything else.\n",
      "I know there are people who come to your house and help you with that, but I haven't gotten into that yet either.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But you're kind of aware of some different options?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm going to switch gears and talk about relationships with family and friends, if that's okay with you?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know that you mentioned that your daughters have kind of told you to get rid of some of your stuff.\n",
      "How in general do your family and friends feel about your hoarding disorder or your clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I don't know how they feel.\n",
      "I know my daughters don't like it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. So next I want to move to talking about some of the explanations that patients with hoarding disorder have for their behavior.\n",
      "I know we had you list some earlier on.\n",
      "Are these explanations, in your opinion, post hoc reasons to justify pathological need?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t know.\n",
      "That’s what my lab is trying to figure out.\n",
      "I don’t think there are false explanations.\n",
      "I think that they may not be the… they may not get at the biology underlying the disorder, but I think that people do save for lots of reasons, sentimental in addition to other things.\n",
      "And that different people with hoarding disorder have all kinds of different attachments to things.\n",
      "And so I do think there’s an underlying biology that drives most of it, maybe not all of it, but I also think that that biology might express itself in different ways.\n",
      "And that visual memory may be part of it, and for some people sentimental attachment may be part of it.\n",
      "And so I think the answer is kind of in between yes and no for that one.\n",
      "Just because there’s an underlying biology doesn’t mean that the reasons that people give aren’t valid.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So in your experience, how do you think patients would respond to this question from the Brown Assessment of Beliefs?\n",
      "“What do you think has caused you to have these beliefs?”\n",
      "Interviewee: Behaviors, it would have to be for this, not beliefs.\n",
      "Interviewer: Beliefs, behaviors, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: Or difficulties.\n",
      "How do I think patients would respond?\n",
      "I think there would be a whole variety of answers.\n",
      "Many of them would say… I mean a lot of people would attribute it to childhood trauma or some traumatic event.\n",
      "People will say that it is, you know, wanting to remember a loved one.\n",
      "Some will say that they… They will give reasons that have to do with why they keep things, not causation.\n",
      "I think that if you asked somebody about what you think has caused it, I’m not sure that they would be able to answer it in that direct way.\n",
      "I think they would say, you know, “I need to do this because I have memory problems,” or “I want to remember my mom,” or “I need to be sure I won’t need something in that newspaper,” or “I need to read everything before I discard it.”\n",
      "But I don’t think that they’ll say something along the lines of, “No I was born this way,” or, you know, “it’s genetic,” or anything like that.\n",
      "I think they’ll give kind of individual reasons.\n",
      "Interviewer: How do you think they’d respond to kind of the second half of the question?\n",
      "“Do these beliefs or behaviors have a psychiatric or psychological, neurological cause, or are they true?”\n",
      "Interviewee: True?\n",
      "That’s part of the BABS?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I'll take a good clean mud to that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, I'm sorry to hear that that happened to your house.\n",
      "So it sounds like that silk that you were holding in your hand, you said was your most precious item?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, it was then.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Because she got married eight months later, seven months later.\n",
      "And I didn't want to find it again.\n",
      "I finally decided what I wanted to make.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "But as far as what I couldn't-\n",
      "PART 3 OF 4 ENDS [01:09:04]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "As far as what I couldn't throw, my most precious ... I don't know what.\n",
      "There's nothing that stands out as my most precious item.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Maybe people can because in and of themselves, I don't own really anything that has intrinsic value.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, but it sounds like that that silk was valuable at the time because you're going to use it for your daughter's wedding, right?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I found my hips are larger than my top and because of that, I need plenty of room in the skirt.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "You try on these slender dresses, it doesn't work.\n",
      "So I was going to make mine, and I finally decided on what I was going to do with it.\n",
      "I tried on many a dresses, and it just wasn't happening.\n",
      "So, I made my own, and that worked.\n",
      "This is quite an aside, but someone came up to me and said, \"Oh, I see you decided to buy your outfit.\n",
      "You're mother of the bride after all.\"\n",
      "Oh, what a compliment.\n",
      "But that's eight years ago.\n",
      "10, 13.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Long time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It had been a while ago.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "If you had to choose between your items, how would you choose?\n",
      "So if you had to choose between keeping something and throwing something away, I guess, between a few different things, what would be the criteria for choosing what would stay and what would go?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I suppose whether it was relatively, immediately useful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "If it was immediately useful?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I don't mean instant, but within several weeks.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Something that you would use within several weeks?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What would you say are the most important differences between what would be considered normal saving behavior, such as collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "A lot of people don't even have books.\n",
      "They don't read.\n",
      "So we have lots of books.\n",
      "Just a number of them.\n",
      "[inaudible 01:12:06].\n",
      "Say that question over again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's kind of a mouthful.\n",
      "I'll repeat it.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah, I understood what it was, but my brain didn't absorb it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's completely fine.\n",
      "So what would you say are the most important differences between what someone might consider to be normal saving behavior, like collecting, and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "P2: That is really interesting I will be really interested to hear what you find um just kind of concretely how do you operationalize that in terms of when you look at a patent in front of you and you have to make that determination how do you make it clinically?\n",
      "Interviewee: You mean like differentiating between the collector and the\n",
      "P2: Mhm or the clutter the cluttered person who you know um who has a lot of stuff versus a hoarder versus somebody who has difficulties discarding but as you said maybe doesn’t have control over their space how do you when you're sitting with a patient um and you're not sure how do you determine if their saving behavior is normal or abnormal?\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm yeah I think I mean uh partially what we want to do with this data is to try to get better at differentiating that so they way we recruited for that study was to use really strict exclusion inclusion criteria if you’re in the hoarding group you have to meet for DSM five criteria for hoarding disorder okays so it's pretty strict how we define that inclusion with the healthy controls you have to have to not meet that diagnosis and you have to be below the means of that SIR okay so with in the like normative healthy range of on the saving inventory revised and then for the collectors the only criteria we used for them was that they could not meet the criteria for hoarding disorder which most of them did not meet for two reasons one they didn’t have the clutter and then two they had difficulties discarding but only with respect to the thing they collected let me tell you there are so many weird collections out there (laughing) that alone was fascination um like they guy who collected fire hydrants he had a hard time he had extreme difficulty discarding his fire hydrants (laughing) but he did not have a difficulty discarding anything else\n",
      "P2: Okay so perhaps these is INAUDIBLE (50:29) making this distinction there is an element of knowing being able to value some things over others\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm but we’ll see if that holds true right because we’re going to look at the data dimensionally and and I would not characterize collectors a healthy\n",
      "P2: Great so perhaps it’s a spectrum as well\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah for sure and and ya know that’s good that’s we did a INAUDIBLE (51:06) study on hoarding and it at least looking at the least and looking at difficulties discarding and clutter it is a dimension\n",
      "P2: Great\n",
      "Interviewee: Tts is a spectrum it's not that there is a latten taxon on hoarding versus non hoarding\n",
      "P2: Great okay what about in terms of demographics of patients with hoarding disorder what do they tend to look like when you think of a hoarder when you picture them what would they typically be just in terms of oh age race economic status perhaps region background if they are real or urban\n",
      "P2: Um I'm laughing because these are all complicated questions um and I'm not talking to the media so I'm not trying to be INAUDIBLE (52:01)\n",
      "P2: Yeah and it’s a confidential interview so don’t be like I said the idea is to gage where people where the field is and what we know right now what we what are INAUDIBLE (52:10)\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah no no no I understand\n",
      "P2: Well we don’t need an evidence based citation for what you're about to say\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you think there should be a central location like if should be centralized in one place or another because I’m curious in terms of the because we obviously have the doctor’s office when you come here for therapy, but as you alluded to throughout there are always challenges going on and these symptoms and their fear of all these different domains of um children’s lives?\n",
      "Speaker: I think it’s great that if you just show like a... like a shorten version of a day in their actual lives like what they are doing outside of the office because what you are essentially doing is here you are giving them skills on how to deal with their issues in their life, in their world on a day the day bases so if you just, it’s like a day in the life of you know a child.\n",
      "You know, getting up, getting ready for school, getting to school, doing school.\n",
      "I mean you don’t have to get all involved just a little clips you know.\n",
      "Speaker: So now I think of it like similar, but um where maybe being the office is kind of like the center or what would be in the middle of the video and so you show some examples of what life is like having some of these disorders [36:56]\n",
      "school or whatever problems and then you show the imagery of here and then you show more positive imagery, like first the beginning might be a little slightly negative you know that image of the brick against the brain you know and then here it’s a cotton ball or whatever happens some of those similar images turn positive after their experience here.\n",
      "That’s kind of the flow I see, but I’m not in this field so I don’t know anything about it.\n",
      "[Laughs]\n",
      "Interviewer: Well of course, that’s obviously why we are asking…\n",
      "Speaker: I know nothing about it, but that’s just kind of if I were imaging it if I were to… That’s kind of how I would want to see it.\n",
      "Speaker: Or even running across the same thing but dealing with it differently you know like being able to…you know...if they run across an obstacle and then they come across that same obstacle but they’re able the…\n",
      "Speaker: Like show the obstacle in the beginning and show it after and then show…\n",
      "Speaker: how they change…yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, and how to deal with that.\n",
      "Interviewer: For things like that and I guess for general too and for talking about CBT and like how it works what would you guys say should be spoken about or talked about?\n",
      "…… So for an example, should they find out about the CBT explanation of how anxiety works?\n",
      "Speaker: Should they be shown?\n",
      "Interviewer: Or shouldn’t be\n",
      "38: 23 Speaker: Oh into a\n",
      "Interviewer: video\n",
      "Speaker: video\n",
      "Interviewer: in one way shape or another.\n",
      "You’re not...\n",
      "You’re shaking your head.\n",
      "Speaker: I would think just mention it because if you are at the point where you are looking up coming to this program, you already know about anxiety, you already know about OCD, you already know about Tourette’s, you already know about all the other things that you’ve already been there.\n",
      "You just want to know or are we going to deal with these diagnoses, are we…is this going to be covered under what you are doing.\n",
      "I personally wouldn’t think you need to go into any great explanation\n",
      "Interviewer: about how\n",
      "Speaker: of any of these diagnoses.\n",
      "Speaker: That may take away from or\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah cause’ I think, I would imagine the point they are saying is ok you are going to need to go here, you already know what you are dealing with at that point, it is not brand new you know.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Other than books?\n",
      "Well, let's see.\n",
      "Say that again.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "So, outside of books, are there any other places you've heard about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I watched a program.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "What's the name of that?\n",
      "It was a veterinary outfit out in Texas, and people would go in and get the animals where there'd be too many animals in a space, trash, and poop, and all sorts of gross stuff.\n",
      "I don't have any gross stuff, but they would get them out.\n",
      "Then they would show the house.\n",
      "I hear about bodies that are found.\n",
      "You'll think about two brothers, one day, one of the brothers disappeared, and then the other brother was, the day he died.\n",
      "He got dead.\n",
      "Then when they got in, they found the other brother.\n",
      "This is from television.\n",
      "I didn't watch but one or two episodes of that hoarding.\n",
      "I don't know what the title is of the program was, but those people.\n",
      "It turned my stomach.\n",
      "So where else have I heard about how they ...\n",
      "Of course, I saw it in my mother.\n",
      "Showed evidenced of it in my one daughter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, when you think about the words hoarding disorder, what comes to mind?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Someone who can't throw things away or give it away, who's so tied up in her own value that she's got to keep it all.\n",
      "\"Oh, isn't that a neat ...\"\n",
      "Makes me think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So being so caught up in, can't give things up.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Your own important.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Caught up in your own importance?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that this gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Me having so much stuff?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah, definitely because I can't find things that I want to do.\n",
      "I've put them in a box, and I can't find what I want to do.\n",
      "So I spend the time looking for something instead of doing it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "So, you're spending all this time looking for it instead of doing it.\n",
      "Can you describe a time that you can think of that hoarding problems got in the way of something you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "No. Nothing stands out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I know you mentioned that you used to own a shop.\n",
      "Am I correct?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It was a gift shop.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "A gift shop.\n",
      "Did any of these kinds of issues get in the way of that?\n",
      "Or work in general?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "No, not actually, because I knew that people who came into the store would not like to see a jumble.\n",
      "They would not like to see dust.\n",
      "We made sure that things were taken care of, and were neat and tidy.\n",
      "You can't spend time looking for things when someone calls and says, \"Do you have?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You have to know where it's at?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just the list for now, we could always go into it I think [crosstalk 00:03:45] it'll probably come up later.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah I think I would say [inaudible 00:03:51] the question is why do I collect, right?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay so, I'm a little under rested but I should be okay and what did I say?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You said to remind you of an event so far.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay, right and...[inaudible 00:04:07] some other...why do I collect?\n",
      "I guess I do like, I do appreciate, some of the beauty in some of the things I collect.\n",
      "So I like [inaudible 00:04:35] art and various kinds of art.\n",
      "I think I have a feeling that I want to be able to go back to that thing, even if it's a book.\n",
      "So while I read the book [inaudible 00:04:57] always be there for me.\n",
      "So, maybe preventing a loss of the experience.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So just saving it for later just in case, or?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay so reminding you of an event, appreciation of beauty, and preventing a loss of experience or being able to go back to it sounds like that's your list.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that's great.\n",
      "Okay, the next question's a little bit different.\n",
      "So, please list all the ways that a person could identify someone with hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "A messy home space...maybe someone who doesn't pay attention to their appearance because they're more concerned about all their things.\n",
      "Someone who is more self-centered, perhaps.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "And someone who talks about their collecting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, you've mentioned messy space, someone who doesn't pay attention as much to their appearance, someone who may be self-centered or someone who talks about their collecting.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Those are great.\n",
      "Okay, would that complete your list?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I guess, I feel [inaudible 00:06:54] speak from my experience and perhaps my mother and my brother.\n",
      "Well one thing I guess that my brother does, he's fairly inquisitive and he is talking about the things that he keeps getting.\n",
      "So, was that part of...that's talking about the collecting so that's pretty much it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So, our last listing question is, please list all of the reasons that people may want to seek treatment for hoarding.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "If it takes over their life, if they want to have more personal connections and their collections or collecting is keeping them from getting to that point, running out of money, and did I say running out of space?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, that's another one.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "And running out of space, no more room on the bookshelves.\n",
      "I think that's probably about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so taking over life, wanting to make more personal connections, running out of money and space.\n",
      "So that completes your list?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha, so the budget for sure.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is trash for you?\n",
      "What do you discard, what things are you-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Very little.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Very little.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Very little.\n",
      "When I print, I'm a writer right now so after I write something and I print it out in order to read it or to edit it, I'll print it out and I use both sides of the paper and then I may not even throw it out then which in the last several months has been causing me a lot of heartache, because my place where I write is so full of papers and books that then when I have to get my hands on something I have to go through all these papers which should have been thrown out because I've edited and done what I wanted to do and it's no longer applicable.\n",
      "I should throw it out but for some reason I just hang on to it and if there's a page that has a space not used, I will sometimes cut it away from the part that is used and I save half a page of paper.\n",
      "I have stacks of these little bits of paper that I use to take notes.\n",
      "For some reason, I got into the habit and this is many years ago, of keeping notes on scraps of paper.\n",
      "Instead of using a notebook or a pad of paper I keep all this stuff on scraps of paper and I mean, I've got not only piles right now in front of me but I have, when I finally decide to clean up I will, instead of going through and sorting them out I'll just put them in a paper bag and store them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "It sounds like what you're telling me is you don't really throw that much stuff away and you'll even save scraps of paper that have a little bit of space even though maybe it would be a better idea to throw it out, because then you have a lot of papers to sort through?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Let's-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "The same thing goes for paper towels or napkins.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:26:59].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Always just saving little parts?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I don't waste any part of a paper towel.\n",
      "If I dry my hands on a paper towel that paper towel is saved.\n",
      "I put it some place in the kitchen so that I can get my hands on it to dry my hands on it again because by the time I use it again, it's dry.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Then this is actually a great transition.\n",
      "We can talk more about your space and your living area.\n",
      "Seems like you don't throw a lot of things away, does that mean you have a lot of clutter in your home?\n",
      "Can you tell me about what you space looks like?\n",
      "Speaker: And also have to be self-aware, aware like oh well now’s the time I need to [04:23] __ those skills you know….\n",
      "It’s hard.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right… So the goal of CBT at least in this context probably is to reduce anxiety or at least be able to live with the anxiety umm if someone asked you how anxiety became a problem is someone’s life how would you respond?\n",
      "Like what information will be important for other potential patients to know.\n",
      "Speaker: On how to recognize or…\n",
      "Interviewer: However, I mean whatever you believe would be important to kind of know about anxiety coming about, becoming something that is uh problematic that needs to be uh challenged.\n",
      "Speaker: I think one of the biggest things that knowing that it can either stand alone as a diagnosis or it can also be [5:16] ___ a from another diagnosis.\n",
      "And you know things that can kind of interweave that um and to know that it can manifest itself in so many different ways you know it’s not like, oh you have this kind of rash, you have chicken pox.\n",
      "You know, it’s it’s that’s pretty black and white or you have [05:35] ___ , its so many like greys and just you know everything from sleeplessness you know, I wonder if somethings wrong they can’t sleep, to um appetite being affected, you know friendships, all kind of things.\n",
      "So I think it’s important for people to know that it can either stand alone or it can be so involved in other diagnoses and um the best thing to do is to be aware and educate themselves as much as possible on how it can be a broad spectrum.\n",
      "[06:10]\n",
      ".\n",
      "Interviewer: Anything you’d like to add to that?\n",
      "Umm [06:15] __ what’s the question again?\n",
      "Interviewer: Sorry, so it’s a bit of a complicated one um, what’s you know when anxiety becomes a problem in someone’s life?\n",
      "Like what should people know in terms of how to address that, is there anything in particular that’s really important for individuals?\n",
      "Speaker: That it, I mean, I feel like that you don’t ignore it or you know you don’t just think oh well it’s just a passing thing I think you um… I think umm… I don’t know… we’d just do the best you can, I guess in trying to address it.\n",
      "And not let it get worse.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you guys tell me about from your perspective um certain areas that CBT really targets or skills that it builds?\n",
      "Kind of going off this discussion of kind like how anxiety can become very impairing like it can stem, it can manifest itself in many different ways.\n",
      "Speaker: Um that’s a little hard, I guess just because I am at a point where I haven’t seen that yet.\n",
      "(Laugh)\n",
      "Interviewer: Sure, sure\n",
      "Speaker: Um I’m hoping it will teach self-awareness and the um the ability to really kind of recognize … one’s own thought and feeling and then hopefully understand the appropriate behavior that needs to follow or not follow as a result of that and what’s and keeping appropriate for the setting if that makes sense, but um that’s what we hope for him and that they don’t let anything come to debilitating in their life and to also recognize when to they need to reach out for help.\n",
      "To recognize when maybe a line been crossed and ok I need to say something, you know\n",
      "Speaker: Like they are slipping and they do reach out and or you know be able to reign it in somehow.\n",
      "039\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Can you tell me a little bit more about why, you said that you have never thought of seeking treatment, why is that?\n",
      "Do you not think that your hoarding is as bad as the people you were just describing or why not seek treatment?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I know my hoarding is bad and right now I have a relationship.\n",
      "I've had a relationship with another woman for, coming up next month it will be 44 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, congratulations.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "She doesn't like the fact that I hoard.\n",
      "For instance, we have a basement in our house and it's practically unusable because of all the things that I won't throw away.\n",
      "She makes noises from time to time that, \"Please make an effort to get rid of some of your stuff.\n",
      "It would be nice to use the basement.\"\n",
      "Again, I don't feel that it's something that I need to, I honestly don't, I mean, I've gone to, have sought therapy about other issues in my life three different times.\n",
      "One person was very helpful for me, but in general I end up entertaining the therapist because I've had a very unusual, very rich diverse life and, in fact, the last therapist even told me that she looked forward to our meetings so she could hear my stories.\n",
      "She had the nerve to actually tell me that.\n",
      "I suspected it, but when she actually admitted it to me then I quit immediately.\n",
      "Anyway, two of my therapists I've gotten very little help and I really don't think that a therapist or a psychiatrist could help me at all.\n",
      "I don't think it's the kind of behavior that's amenable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You don't think so, your hoarding, you don't think it can be fixed?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "I don't.\n",
      "I really do think that it is something that was just burned into you as a kid for various reasons or that it's genetic.\n",
      "My father had a terrible hoarding problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I was just going to ask if you had any family member that had had it.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We were ranchers but then we moved to Arizona and had our own house down there.\n",
      "He had a shed that was about a size of a small house and that shed was absolutely chocked full of stuff he'd pick up mainly off the road.\n",
      "His idea was that, \"Well, maybe I can use this sometime.\"\n",
      "That's a lot of my reasoning.\n",
      "He never got over it, he eventually sold that house where the shed was, but then he started where he moved to a ranch in a different part of Tucson, he started another shed.\n",
      "It was not as full as the old one but it was the same kind of thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "We don't go often and we're pretty careful, we're always masking.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "How has or has covid affected your family financially?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "So far, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now our last section is still about covid.\n",
      "How have you been coping since COVID-19?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I worry about everybody.\n",
      "I've had friends who were affected and so it's pretty much... we can't do things.\n",
      "We were supposed to go to Canada for a month and well, we couldn't, so that was very disappointing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Where do you seek comfort?\n",
      "Do you seek comfort from your items or from others?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:45:14] Not from my items, no. I guess my interactions with humans other than on the phone or neighbors that we might see in the parking lot.\n",
      "What was I going to say...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You were talking about interactions with people.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I miss having the freedom to do whatever I want.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Have you sought treatment resources or some other kind of professional support during covid?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No. I haven't felt the need to do that from covid, no. I think there was one point where my wife was getting a little stir-crazy, I don't know if it was the weather was keeping us in more than usual or just missing human contact.\n",
      "I think we've reached a point where we have sort of a mix of making contact, distanced contact, with a few close friends and my son, our daughter came to visit for a few days.\n",
      "We're [inaudible 00:46:42] a vacation for two weeks this weekend.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, how nice.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "So we're trying to get something to keep us out of [inaudible 00:47:02] horrible, horrible place.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Did you feel socially isolated or lonely before COVID-19?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "Has covid affected any sense of isolation or loneliness?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah, I miss being able to casually see somebody.\n",
      "I was involved in my local YMCA [inaudible 00:47:32] couple of activities and I miss...\n",
      "One of them had more of a comradery than the other, it was a one-on-one type of situation, the other one was a class situation, but, you know everybody's...\n",
      "Some of the same people that was nice.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "But I've kind of learned to do that one exercise, the class one, on my own at home.\n",
      "I give myself a harder workout so I've adjusted to that.\n",
      "The other activity I miss very much and I dream about it on a semi-regular basis.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So some things you've learned to adapt to and other things you still miss.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And my last question is have you experienced any conflict during the COVID-19 measures?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah so so I I fell into hoarding when I was actually before I went to graduate school so I was biochemistry major as an undergrad and I was headed to medical school to go into psychiatry and then like my senior year I I in the spring of my senior year I was like ‘I don’t I don’t think I want to go to medical school’ so I took some time off and worked in a lab for the NIH with a guy by the name of NAME (38:23) um NAME (38:27) has since passed away but he was one of he’s a real great in the OCD world um you know like NAME (38:35) and um NAME (38:39) and NAME (38:40) and and a ton of people that their post-doc training with NAME (38:44) and so you know he had a focus on looking at the serotonin transporter gene so there was a genetics lab kind of more neuroscience slash genetics portion and then they also did family studies of patients with OCD um but I kind of got interested in the OCD portion even though I was there to do more of the animal studies with uh the serration transporter not that INAUDIBLE (39:15) but I became really fascinated by these patients with OCD and their families um and and even early on and this was like forever ago right this was 2001 yeah like 2001 2002 2003 um there were these patients that were you know with in the pile of heterogeneity of OCD that weren’t behaving how all the rest were so they were they didn’t respond to treatment psychotherapy as well they they messed up all of the genetics results (laughing) they were just a huge pain in the butt and so NAME (39:55) was one of the first uh labs to really adopt NAME (40:03) and NAME (40:05)’s saving inventory revised to so with in his sample of OCD um we started looking at hoarding behaviors um so fast forward I decided to not go into neuroscience and not to go into medical school and I instead got my PhD in clinical psychology and I did that at UNIVERSITY (40:26) um with NAME (40:27) who is actually an anxiety researcher but um NAME (40:34) was great because he let me do whatever I wanted to and what I kept gravitating back to was OCD and then this like mystery group of patients um which was the focus of hoarding um so yeah so that’s my background so I'm a clinical psychologist and after I finished my PhD I did all of my clinical internships and my postdoc up at UNIVERSITY (41:01) uh with OCD and related disorders program up there and I've been down here at UNIVERSITY (41:03) for the last eight years\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So tell me about where you live now.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I live in Cypress, Texas.\n",
      "I live in a single family home in the recent development called Bridgeland.\n",
      "It's one of the biggest ones in the area.\n",
      "My son-in-law was the project manager for this development and the company he was with fell on hard times, it's a bit of a story and you can probably remember when Sears bought Kmart.\n",
      "Kmart had [inaudible 00:21:32].\n",
      "There was kind of a similar thing and-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you live in a room in their house?\n",
      "You live with-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I have a room in her house but the [inaudible 00:21:44] my son-in-law was ...\n",
      "He was a manager for the project that built this development.\n",
      "The roads and stuff to Cypress, they were his designs, but anyway, it's a new ownership of the company, they have strong differences and now I get in the story too much.\n",
      "Anyway, he's done what he's required to do and he has his own company now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "He's a developer.\n",
      "But my biggest heartburn is how much he wastes money.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What do you mean by that?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:22:14] good point.\n",
      "Now one bedroom and we're asked to [inaudible 00:22:19].\n",
      "It's a four bedroom house.\n",
      "I have one.\n",
      "There's two and half beds on the first floor, there's two and a half beds on the second floor.\n",
      "There's a [crosstalk 00:22:34].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you say ...\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I don't go upstairs very much, [inaudible 00:22:37] stairs but I have a room-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you mainly just have your room downstairs?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I'm sorry?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You mainly just have your room.\n",
      "Is your room cluttered now?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "It's not so cluttered that I can't walk around, but it is cluttered because every horizontal space has stuff on it.\n",
      "Do you do FaceTime?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, not for this interview but that would be interesting to do for a future interview to see your space, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:23:00] tried to take a video [inaudible 00:23:04].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, why you don't you try describing your room for me?\n",
      "What kinds of stuff have you saved and where is it located?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I've got a closet full.\n",
      "I've got stuff.\n",
      "I have a couple boxes in the garage of stuff, but I have several boxes of stuff upstairs in the attic section and I have a bedroom that's maybe, I'll just say, 18 by 24 maybe sectioned it up, and [inaudible 00:23:38] length of the window.\n",
      "So I have stuff by every horizontal surface.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What kind of stuff do you have in your room?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I have extra drawers, I have boxes.\n",
      "Some of the [died 00:23:56] objects and I want to give that away.\n",
      "There's also a computer, monitor, keypad, and mails.\n",
      "It's ordered, sorted, filing cabinets and a little set of storage desks.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "It was a joke in the family.\n",
      "None of us ever thought that this was something that you could get treatment for.\n",
      "And as I say, I really do think that it's something that's inherited or really ingrained in you and I'm not at all convinced that any therapy would help.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There is a lot of evidence that hoarding does have a genetic component so that's a good intuition that you have there, and it makes sense that you would think that given your father struggled with that as well.\n",
      "There are actually, in the lab that I work in, my boss has developed an intervention specifically for hoarding and there's actually a lot of evidence that it works.\n",
      "If you were ever interested, you could definitely seek it out, if you like.\n",
      "Of course, you have to believe in it and all that but I'm definitely happy to hear your opinion on that.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm 77 now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "At best, I probably have 20 years to live and I am thinking about getting rid of a lot of stuff.\n",
      "In fact, my partner and I are both book lovers and have thousands of books.\n",
      "We sell our books on Amazon and we've already sold 1,000 books, but we have several thousand to go.\n",
      "At some point, these books are going to have to be gotten rid of.\n",
      "Book people don't...\n",
      "You can't give books to libraries, they don't want them.\n",
      "No matter how priceless they are in the sense of... I have a lot of art books so my books would be, I think, very valuable to a library.\n",
      "I've tried to give these books to libraries before and they don't want them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, you save books, you save bags, you save boxes, are there anything else that you save?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "For a while I was really into buying shoes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Shoes, got it.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I started having a love affair with shoes when I was about a sophomore or junior in high school and discovered that you didn't have to wear saddle shoes or brogans, that there were really nice stylish imported fashionable shoes so I started buying really good and unusual shoes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You started collecting that, huh?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Okay. No, that's all [inaudible 00:09:14] said [inaudible 00:09:14] although it's valuable for help for my care of that stuff and it is valuable on the ranch to have this stuff.\n",
      "Where I am it's not valuable to [inaudible 00:09:23], it's a hanker.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So where you grew up it was actually an asset to be able to save stuff and then have it when you need it, but then when you kind of, moved out of that environment it stopped being helpful for you.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you were even able to identify your uncle when you didn't know where he was by the fact that his yard looked just like your father's yard.\n",
      "Do you want to get that?\n",
      "Should I hang on while you get the phone?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Okay, thank you, I've got two phones here actually...Hello?\n",
      "[inaudible 00:09:45] completely hung up [inaudible 00:09:45].\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "I lost track of where we were in the conversation.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so you were explaining to me that this was a problem that you've had your whole life, but it isn't really a problem for you.\n",
      "It is more that you-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:10:17] That's why it's problem, right?\n",
      "It's a problem if it's situationally dependent [inaudible 00:10:23] it.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:10:24].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sorry, Participant 036.\n",
      "I'm hearing this echo on our call.\n",
      "Could you maybe move the phone-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:10:30] get that away from my truck.\n",
      "Is it better now?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's much better, thank you.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you've experienced this kind of thing your whole life, when did it start to become a problem in your life?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Well, I bought a house in Golden, Colorado I had a wife.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "And, she was the one that started to bring her own stuff.\n",
      "I brought five washing machines, abandoned washing machines to bring them home to take to the motors out, and stuff like that.\n",
      "My wife brought it up to me and said, \"this is not normal.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it was really your wife that first made you feel like it was a problem because you were bringing home all these washing machines.\n",
      "How many washing machines do you think you brought home?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Well, we brought home two and I kept trying to untiL she got done talking to me, I didn't dare bring home any more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "So she nipped it in the bud for you there.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Till this day, I want to strip all the plastic off appliances and stuff.\n",
      "You never know when you might need a small screw.\n",
      "Unfortunately you can't find a small screw in the three dollar coffee can full of small screws, depends what you're looking for.\n",
      "So it's not very practical what I recognized.\n",
      "So I stifled myself and I don't do it anymore but [inaudible 00:11:55].\n",
      "Interviewee: I would be super interested in that um and and very much game and so yeah even also in sifting through these interviews if I can be help for that especially since you know NAME (1:55:02) will be providing more of like an MD perspective and then I would be providing more of like a psychology uh clinical psychologist perspective so that could be helpful in that\n",
      "P2: That be INAUDIBLE (1:55:13) when we get to the data analysis stage that would be very very helpful I think\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah and then the the last piece that I’ll say that we can kind of like you know file away an and remember for the the the future is that um you know if you do end up going towards the like patient interviews um that’s the part where I also you know I don’t have I have three graduate students who are working with me um but I have an army of undergraduates and some of them are the ones that do the hoarding groups um and so there they know about hoarding they’re trained and also they are clinically very adaptive because I selected them for the group so we could also think about that they may be able to help with the interviews that would be like a concrete way\n",
      "P2: Yeah that would be helpful and we’ve also kind of wondered and this is perhaps another issue for another day um we’ve wondered how difficult it would be to recruit hoarders for these interviews um and have thought about perhaps seeing if we could recruit collaborators to help us find hoarders to interview so if you would be game um for that kind of role of collaboration with us as well we can talk about that you know we’d have to obviously figure it out before logistically and in terms of the IRB um but um that might also be helpful depending on how our recruitment goes\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah for sure for sure absolutely yeah and I mean you guys are just up the road so um so yeah\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (1:56:51) speaking yeah\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah that’s great well nice to make contact and nice to meet you guys\n",
      "P1: Yeah definitely\n",
      "P2: Yeah and thank you so much again for your time with the interview we I think both enjoyed it and appreciated you your insight\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah sorry if I was long winded\n",
      "P2: No no no not at all um its great and it's great that there are you know um there is definitely a spectrum to which degree people are kind of engaging with these issues and so we’ve had interviews with people who are relatively unwilling to engage and are like of like ‘why are you asking these questions?’ and then we have other people who are like ‘yes I think about this all the time’ and it's always gratifying to have that and we always get a lot out of them um\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh cool\n",
      "P2: We appreciate your time and thank you\n",
      "Interviewee: You're so welcome\n",
      "P2: And we’ll be in touch over time to follow up with the next steps\n",
      "Interviewee: That sounds great\n",
      "P2: Thank you so much for your time again\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay bye bye\n",
      "P2: Take care bye\n",
      "Speaker: And I also wondered too as far as siblings go like, they kind of do need to know what’s going on if they are of the right age, because then if they are just wow wow they have fallen on those traps too, they are like wait a second why is everyone doing something different you know and I haven’t necessarily been on this or maybe I was briefly quickly told something in the car, hey we are going to start doing this from now on, you know or whatever and that’s very important that they don’t feel left out, plus that they are fully engaged and can also help with the whole [19:03] ___.\n",
      "Speake 1: Right\n",
      "Interviewer: Very much like a family system.\n",
      "Speaker: Absolutely.\n",
      "It affects every single person.\n",
      "Speaker: True\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you, any either of you have any friends or family that have gone through similar experience or have gone through CBT before to your knowledge?\n",
      "Speaker: Not that I know of\n",
      "Interviewer: Not that you know of.\n",
      "Do you, have you ever recalled seeing anything about CBT in popular media, like in shows, or movies, or in books?\n",
      "Speaker: Umm, I don’t know.\n",
      "I don’t know.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I don’t recall.\n",
      "Speaker: No.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok\n",
      "Speaker: “As good as it gets”, but he really didn’t go through therapy he just started.\n",
      "I don’t know if you have seen that movie.\n",
      "Interviewer: Oh was that a movie.\n",
      "Speaker: Uh?\n",
      "Interviewer: No, I haven’t seen that movie.\n",
      "No. Speaker: No, anyways, Jack Nicholson.\n",
      "Speaker: I remember that movie.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "20:01: Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, he as OCD and he finally was realizing it, and he went finally go get therapy and he busted into the office, but they really didn’t do [20:07] ___.\n",
      "Speaker: mmmh, with Greg Kinnear\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I remember that.\n",
      "Interviewer: So one question that we’ve been asking is um if you could have three words that describe what CBT is, what would those words be?\n",
      "…. Three words.\n",
      "Speaker: That’s hard\n",
      "Speaker: Well, I think challenge is one cause’ we always, we gotta challenge ourselves.\n",
      "It’s our big thing.\n",
      "Speaker: I guess I was thinking more of three consecutive words that mean, that could go together but my first thing that really made sense that came to my head was like reformed thoughts and behavior and it seems like a process of learning to reform and retrain and I’m not really settling on three words, am I.\n",
      "Interviewer: No, no those are three words.\n",
      "Just the first three words that kind of just come to your head for that.\n",
      "Speaker: Reform, or retrain.\n",
      "Really reform I think, thought and behaviors, because that’s kind of what’s happening hopefully.\n",
      "Speaker: I guess for us is you know challenge yourself.\n",
      "Umm push past the anxiety and do it anyway cause’ if you don’t it will just get worse.\n",
      "Interviewer: Maybe not necessarily for your specific [22:01] __, but like when you think really broadly of CBT, is there anything that pops out in your head, that just comes in your head and you’re like that’s what I think of.\n",
      "Speaker: Controlling your thoughts and behaviors.\n",
      "Interviewer: So like control.\n",
      "Speaker: mmmh.\n",
      "Interviewer: Control…..\n",
      "So like challenge, fight control, and then reform thoughts behaviors.\n",
      "OK, do any like pictures come to mind when you think of those things or broadly CBT, like do you have an image in your head?\n",
      "Speaker: No, my only image so far is really just my child sitting in the office or us sitting or speaking, but I guess if we were to think beyond that….\n",
      "I don’t know….\n",
      "I got conjure up something….\n",
      "Do you have any images?\n",
      "Speaker: Of CBT?\n",
      "I don’t know just hand washing standing in front of the sink, I don’t know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yes, more of an abstract concept, you know.\n",
      "Speaker: yeah, in the abstract concepts…\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, great.\n",
      "So, now we're going to move on to the next section of the Interviewer which is more of a conversation.\n",
      "You could just answer the questions like you would any normal conversation.\n",
      "So, the first section of questions is about your behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Could you please describe your hoarding and how long it's been going on?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'm going to say it probably started when I was a pre-teen, maybe even younger, in my single digit years.\n",
      "So my mother I would say was a hoarder, she was a child of the Depression and I remember collecting comic books and I think my mother gave me the idea that they were valuable so it was good to collect them.\n",
      "So, back then I don't know how valuable they were but that became my mode of operation.\n",
      "So, I would collect the comic books, I would collect the baseball cards, I would save them.\n",
      "So I was saving a lot of stuff and when I got older I started buying records and I bought a lot of records and I bought more records than a human being could probably listen to or need and part of my reason was, okay I'm going to make money with this.\n",
      "In some ways I did but the collecting aspect of it probably outweighed any monetary benefits so if I had not learned that collecting was a good thing I wouldn't have been in the position that I was then and still am in to some extent.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Of wanting and sort of needing to try to get a return on my problem.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so it started off as a monetary thing but it just grew and grew into more of a collecting instead.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah, I don't know where the separation [inaudible 00:11:16] where I separated it but then I think money may have driven me more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and how severe would you say this behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I don't acquire much anymore and I am...one of the things my wife and I [inaudible 00:11:51] have occupied my time in the last four or five days was actually cleaning out our garage where I had so many things that I shouldn't have still had.\n",
      "I filled up almost whole garbage can of mailing envelopes [crosstalk 00:12:10] which I saved because well, I'm going to need the mailing envelopes to mail some of the stuff I have.\n",
      "I didn't need as many mailing envelopes as I had accumulated.\n",
      "It was a mess and right now you can, as of today, after the Vietnam Vets pick up a lot of books and clothing, other things that I had been saving for years and years and were [inaudible 00:12:38].\n",
      "Now you can actually walk in the garage and it's not cluttered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Conflict... Well, I live in a condominium and our condominium association won't schedule our meetings, I don't know if that's a conflict because I think they could somehow figure it out but it's not much of a conflict.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay well-\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I think a lot of times we find that the peoples' behavior is not safe and putting us at risk and that's created conflicts for us.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So like not socially distancing?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah, not socially distancing, not masking, not caring at all about that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, that's unfortunate, yeah.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Small confrontations with people but nothing dangerous.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So that was actually my last question.\n",
      "So now I just need to ask you a couple of demographic questions just for research purposes.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what is your gender identity?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I'm of the male persuasion.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and sex assigned at birth the same?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sex assigned at birth?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And race?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "White male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Ethnicity?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "A mixed breed.\n",
      "What choices were you going to give me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you identify as Hispanic or Latino?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "No, okay.\n",
      "What is your household income?\n",
      "You can give a range if you prefer.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "We're both retired and it's hard for me to gauge but I'll say $50,000.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and your geographic region?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Northeast.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And your highest level of education?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I have a bachelor's degree.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "The other thing is books.\n",
      "I have, at one time in my life, done some Bible studies and there are books.\n",
      "With the fact that I'm a sewer and there are books.\n",
      "I'm also interested in music.\n",
      "I have several hymn books.\n",
      "A Bible in most every translation you want.\n",
      "Why I order it, I don't know?\n",
      "I have the opportunity to do so at a cut rate price.\n",
      "When I [inaudible 00:05:00] issue and that is the interpreter's Bible, Interpreters Study of the Bible, something like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "It's a 16 volume set, which I can hardly lift, because there must be 3,000 pages in some of those books.\n",
      "It's still there and I've used it several times.\n",
      "It's written on a level my brain does not absorb any longer.\n",
      "I need to find someone to give them to.\n",
      "That would clear up 24, 30 inches of space.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A good amount of space.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "One thing I need to do, I don't talk that much.\n",
      "Just get some water.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'll let you get some water and then we can get to the first prompt.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It's usually handy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "We'll go ahead and move on to some other questions.\n",
      "These ones won't be the list ones.\n",
      "And so for some questions, they may not really feel like they apply to you or they might be really short answers.\n",
      "Some of them might be longer, and that's fine.\n",
      "You've already kind of explained some of the different clutter problems, so things with fabric.\n",
      "I know we talked about some things with books, with tools and not putting those away, that not everything has a place.\n",
      "Was there anything else you wanted to add to that?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "What causes the clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "I wasn't very clear.\n",
      "As far as what your clutter, excuse me, what your clutter problems are like.\n",
      "I know, again, you described some things with fabric and-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Is there anything else?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "They're in boxes, but the boxes are forcing me out.\n",
      "I can't seem to make decisions.\n",
      "Decisions are difficult.\n",
      "Because I know I won't use this again, probably, probably.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you said that this-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "But just in case, I will keep it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you said this has been going on at least since high school.\n",
      "Do you know if it started earlier than that?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "It was in what they all called junior high back then.\n",
      "I know back in junior high I wouldn't put things away necessarily.\n",
      "My sister is much neater than I am.\n",
      "And we actually literally put a piece of tape down the center of our room, and I was not to have anything that crossed that tape.\n",
      "So this is, let's see, ninth grade, eighth grade.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Eighth grade, okay.\n",
      "How severe would you say that your clutter problems are now?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "How what?\n",
      "Interviewer: Were you involvement in any way in the CBT or the therapy sessions?\n",
      "Or outside of sessions were you involved with his treatment?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, I think as a parent you’re involved in every moment of your child’s life.\n",
      "And I did learn to be much more patient, and I just, I did learn to not be so impatient with him.\n",
      "Then he’d work things out in his own way and once they showed him the path to go through, he took it.\n",
      "He’s a very smart boy and it was wonderful.\n",
      "Interviewer: What would be useful for other parents to know?\n",
      "Speaker: That I thought it really was a disease that was incurable but it’s not.\n",
      "Interviewer: Sounds amazing.\n",
      "Sounds like there’s hope.\n",
      "Have you ever read or heard about any scientific research about CBT and is it something we should talk about in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: That’s complex now, what’s the first part again?\n",
      "Interviewer: Have you ever read or heard about any scientific research about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: No\n",
      "Interviewer: But um, If you were to, do you think that’s something we should talk about in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "I have a blank of ok “what is this?” Just explaining what it is.\n",
      "Interviewer: Did you know about someone else’s experience with CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: No but I knew some of his friends had it after he went through the therapy and I wound up seeing one of the here.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "What would be useful for those individuals to know?\n",
      "Speaker: That’s hard to say because I’m a parent of one.\n",
      "I only know these other boys from watching them from a distance.\n",
      "So I don’t know how severe it is with them, compared to my son.\n",
      "But I know all the boys (14:03) ___ were very smart and this just allows them to be even quicker and smarter.\n",
      "Interviewer: So now that we’ve talked about the CBT and your perspective of it, we’re going to start talking more so about the video that we’re going to start developing based on the feedback we’re getting from you all.\n",
      "So first, we want to decide who will be in the video.\n",
      "So what characters do you think we should include in the video?\n",
      "Do you think there should be any non-human characters, like animals?\n",
      "Do you think there should be superheroes?\n",
      "Do you think parents, friends, or doctors should be considered?\n",
      "So, what characters are you thinking of?\n",
      "Speaker: I’ve had eleven operations since I’ve lived in this city for 24 years.\n",
      "I watched many videos of what was going to happen to me and the majority of them were boring.\n",
      "I yawned right through all of them.\n",
      "Some of them I wouldn’t even pay attention to, and maybe because you see the lab coat walk in and you see them start with their papers and start to speak and it’s like I’m lost at the very beginning.\n",
      "With kids, superheroes are great.\n",
      "You know if you think about that because everyone relates to Spiderman or Thor or anyone you come up with.\n",
      "It’s like ok, but this guy (15:24)\n",
      ".\n",
      "To see someone in a lab coat, like I’ve watched so many and with their tablet in front of them it’s like, I wouldn’t go there.\n",
      "I…If there was a way to do it, I think a parent could be added just to show shock.\n",
      "It’s like a kid doing something and a parent being in shock, like they never knew they could complete that so quickly.\n",
      "You know, just being positive about it.\n",
      "Interviewer: What about friends?\n",
      "Would friends be a character you would want to see in the videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Friends, yes.\n",
      "Not doctors.\n",
      "Interviewer: So no doctors?\n",
      "Um, when it comes to if an adult is watching this video, do any of these characters change for you?\n",
      "If it’s an adult watching it, an adult who’s the patient, does he even care?\n",
      "Speaker: I think with mature people working on it can make it fit adults and children.\n",
      "Like the superheroes fit.\n",
      "Every adult understands almost every superhero.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah. So, I think about it at least once a week, but I'm like, \"Okay, maybe I can get my dad to send me something, but who knows?\n",
      "I guess we're estranged.\n",
      "We're estranged, so sometimes he'll do the right thing and sometimes he won't.\n",
      "It's like he wants me to do all these different things and I'm like, \"You're my dad.\n",
      "You should be doing these things for me.\n",
      "Why should I have to do all these things for you first?\", you know?\n",
      "But that's neither here nor there.\n",
      "Continue with your questions.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, I'm trying to think [inaudible 00:25:37] the next one.\n",
      "So for this next thing is distinguishing hoarding disorder.\n",
      "How would you say the difference between normal saving behavior and hoarding disorder is?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Like a person doesn't realize that their items are impeding on their personal life.\n",
      "They don't realize that the things are not benefiting them; they're more so taking away from them, like their interaction with people.\n",
      "At least for me, I mean I live with family so I wouldn't be really having people over anyway because my mother is very particular about who comes over [inaudible 00:26:28] have dinner parties and stuff, so very rarely are people in my room but I know that when I do have my own place, that's one thing I want to make sure, like I don't let my living space get out of control where it's like piles of clothes, buying a whole bunch of stuff that I don't need.\n",
      "That's one thing I want to make sure I work on while I'm still living at home.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:26:58] can't rely on my mom for when I have my own place because my thing is, I used to always buy like, \"Oh, this is on sale,\" and, \"Oh, it's only this,\" so I'll buy a gazillion of these things and I never use it.\n",
      "It's just sitting there, or you just donate it.\n",
      "I'm like, \"Okay, you buy stuff and then you return it.\"\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Just knowing that, \"Okay, you only need so much.\n",
      "If you're not going to use it in a year, do you really need it?\" That's what I'm thinking.\n",
      "Some people that hoard or that clutter, it's like, \"You're buying all that stuff, but are you going to use it within a year's time?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "That's how I try to think of it as.\n",
      "\"Are you going to use this up?\", or, \"How is this benefiting you?\", whereas someone who's hoarding, they're not thinking of the pros and cons of something.\n",
      "They just want it right now.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that's a pretty good comparison.\n",
      "So what would you say hoarding disorder does look like, and how is that the same or different from your behavior?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so other than these two rooms with the clutter would you say that the rest of the house is cluttered or is it usable space as well?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No, none of the house...at this point in time, the garage is no longer clutter because the floors are clear and you can see the shelves.\n",
      "No, the only clutter I would say is mine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So then is your home the way that you would like it to look or are there any changes other than, of course, the decluttering that you have been doing?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "That's the only thing that really needs to be changed.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How important are your collections and your things for you to feel at home in your space?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I still have certain collections that I'm attached to.\n",
      "I guess I'm becoming a little less attached to some of my collections.\n",
      "I used to have I'm guessing about 1,000 record albums.\n",
      "I sold all of those, almost all of them, a few years ago, maybe five years ago.\n",
      "This is, I think an important fact for you, my mother died five years ago approximately, a little less than five years ago.\n",
      "She was sick, she needed home care before that so during the point where she needed the home care we had to declutter her house.\n",
      "And then when she died we also had to completely declutter her house.\n",
      "So I think that taught me that I didn't want my children to have to go through what I went through.\n",
      "At this point in time they still would unless my wife just hired the dumpster [inaudible 00:22:28].\n",
      "That's kind of one thing that drives me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So your motivation is for your children not having to go through what you went through with your mother's things?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Right, and one of the other things that encouraged me was something that happened maybe 20 years ago when I was selling another collection that I had was the impermanence of it and the fragility of it and the knowledge if I kept [inaudible 00:23:07] going to disintegrate so I'd rather let somebody else give me a few hundred dollars and let them worry about disintegration.\n",
      "I guess that's another part of the practical and monetizing aspect of my collecting and hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Now we're going to move on to a section about value.\n",
      "When you think about your possessions, of course you've mentioned monetary value and the experiences that you had with these objects.\n",
      "What else makes them valuable to you?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does your daughter and son-in-law help you to keep your room from being cluttered or do they mostly just leave your space to be your space?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "They leave my space to be my space.\n",
      "The only thing they really do in here is ...\n",
      "They don't do it themselves, but they did do it, but they have a cleaning lady who comes in once a week to clean the house, and she comes through too.\n",
      "She like to reorganize things for me very articulate.\n",
      "That's surprising.\n",
      "I took my space, I close the door, I don't see any intention to it.\n",
      "We're both happy that way.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So when you think about your space now and the stuff that you have in it, what is the most valuable?\n",
      "What is the stuff that you save now that you value the most?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Oh, gosh... I don't remember writing an answer on the top of my head.\n",
      "I haven't really thought about that so much, but if I got forced to ...\n",
      "Gosh.\n",
      "I purge stuff once in a while out of necessity and I'd say the most valuable stuff I have in here might be things liker my birth certificate, and my social security card.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It doesn't have to be valuable monetarily.\n",
      "It could also be valuable just to you.\n",
      "So maybe one way of thinking about this is if I were to say, \"Show me the thing that is the most meaningful for you.\"\n",
      "What items in your room would you show me?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I'd have to look hard to find it but I have pictures of children, and my wife as my since she [inaudible 00:26:03].\n",
      "Those are probably the most valuable to me because it's unlocking a bunch of memories.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So yo would most value the items that are attached to the memories of your family?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yes, ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And when you go through your stuff to decide what you've just old me, sometimes you have to purge stuff.\n",
      "How do you decide when it's time to do that and what stiff is okay to purge?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "I really don't think I may have much use for it and maybe somebody could do well with and somebody could take it down to give Goodwill and give to them or Angels [attic 00:26:37].\n",
      "There's various charities around.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:26:42].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So is it-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "One thing I did do though, ma'am I haven't told you about [inaudible 00:26:47] serious weight problem.\n",
      "I was 320 pounds and managed to get down to 185.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow, good for you.\n",
      "That is not easy.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Well, then i just ballooned back up to 230.\n",
      "So weighed this morning, now it's 209.\n",
      "So I am working at it,\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Good for you.\n",
      "Speaker: It’s almost like um having to reinvent the wheel because the wheel is there, and you have to have it function like the wheel, its gonna have to do the job of a wheel, but it can’t necessarily have that same shape the wheel has always had and move the same way the wheel has always moved.\n",
      "So we are gonna have to come up with a new way, a reformed way how are we going to take this object which is the brain of the person and we are going to help it get to the same end goal and may be work around and function slightly differently so we can get there and not get hung up.\n",
      "Umm, so that’s kind if the first logical thing that comes to mind, I guess for me is reinventing the wheel in some way.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s a good piece of imagery too, the wheel.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I’m just not that creative, honestly.\n",
      "Speaker: That’s ok\n",
      "Speaker: I just can’t think of any images as far as that goes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah I mean it’s a very abstract concepts.\n",
      "You know, cause’ it’s kind of like why we are curious of these words like how they, how they imagine it cause’ a lot of times it might just be your personal experience comes to mind.\n",
      "Speaker: Right which can be a little different for each person.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, as I said in the beginning the main purpose of this is to develop some videos basically for CBT for parents and for kids.\n",
      "So, I have a few questions about that that I would like to go over um so keep in mind that these videos are geared technically towards individuals 10-16 year olds, but also their parents too which is why we want the feedback from both groups regarding what these videos should be.\n",
      "Um so, in terms of the characters, who should be in the video?\n",
      "Who should star and who should be speaking in these videos.\n",
      "Speaker: I would think the star would be a child that has already gone through the program and is like I’m here to tell you what you need to know.\n",
      "You know, because I’ve been through it and I’m a kid and I can speak your language.\n",
      "Speaker: Right, or more than one kid like you know just.\n",
      "They don’t have to actually I mean, I guess they would be like actors or something, but you know I mean… cohorts.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, like different children that have different diagnoses like one could be like you know I have OCD and anxiety, you know one could have Tourette’s and OCD or you know um\n",
      "Speaker: Right, like these are my hang ups, these are my issues and how they can vary and how they overcome them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, so depicting like really individualizing it, and really depicting it, Yeah that’s a very important component.\n",
      "Speaker: But something that you know anybody coming into the program can relate to, something from one of these characters.\n",
      "You know at least.\n",
      "Interviewer; Do you think there should be um parents in these videos at all?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t think so.\n",
      "Interviewer: You don’t think there as essential.\n",
      "26: 48 Speaker: I would think yeah, but maybe not as like… the starring feature of the film, but I think to have maybe them sitting with their child in the office, you know what I mean or something, so they know that the parents are gonna have to pretty much be with you umm the whole time you know, but maybe not as the main star.\n",
      "Yeah I would think the parent should be present because that’s what it is when you are here.\n",
      "Speaker: You are very involved, that’s true… But who is this, who is the audiences?\n",
      "Interviewer: So the audience would be 10-16 year olds to start with and the parents as well.\n",
      "Speaker: Oh ok yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: Well I don’t know I would probably do two separate ones you know\n",
      "Interviewer: For each of…\n",
      "Speaker: for each… yes exactly\n",
      "Interviewer: Right\n",
      "Speaker: Kids their perspective, parents see the parent’s perspective\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "And especially, if more of the answers were to be that he can't find his keys because of clutter, then it would be more appropriate, but since most of the answers, at least the way I answered them, feel that it's hoarding.\n",
      "It's a hoarding behavior and not a clutter behavior, then it's even more obvious to me it's hoarding because his not being able to find the keys isn't a matter of moving the boxes out of the shower for instance, because you normally wouldn't keep your keys or lose your keys in the shower anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I don't really think that's a very good part of the story.\n",
      "I could see throwing something else in there but keys are not one of them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Because you think that folks tend to be pretty good about remembering their keys?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Not that they tend to be good about, a lot of people can't remember where they put the keys, but it's usually, it just has to do with memory and with putting the keys down in a place that they normally don't put them, therefore, they don't remember.\n",
      "They usually, people that I have known that can't find their keys, in fact, I have a friend right now who just day before yesterday called me and said, \"Participant 039, I can't come because I can't find my keys.\"\n",
      "Her house is practically bare, she hoards absolutely has no hoarding tendency or clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You're saying that it's not exclusive to people that hoard so maybe a different item would be good.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'll definitely note that.\n",
      "Thank you for that perspective.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I would definitely come up with something else because keys is just not appropriate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Good idea.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This last section is going to ask you about COVID.\n",
      "How has COVID impacted your life?\n",
      "What has changed for you since COVID started?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Absolutely nothing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I'm writing a novel and I spend too many days, I should take a day off and just relax in the garden if nothing else or start getting rid of all the crap that I have.\n",
      "I have actually started to do a little bit, but it really hasn't impacted me because I'm not a social person.\n",
      "Occasionally, NAMEe and I would go out to a restaurant to eat, but now we can order out and go pick up food at these restaurants and I just as soon eat at home anyway.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "It really hasn't impacted me at all.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "In fact, I kind of have to remind myself.\n",
      "In fact, I went to take my dog up to have her groomed this morning and I forgot to put my mask on.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Now, and I'm not totally to blame, we've outgrown this house.\n",
      "We either both need to get rid of a lot of stuff or move to a bigger house.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Maybe the former.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Tell me about your partner, your relationship with her and how it affects, how she approaches it?\n",
      "Seems like she's pretty active in motivating you to get rid of stuff especially because you have guests over and things like that.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "She's actually very easy to get along with.\n",
      "She doesn't nag me about it, but occasionally she'll say, \"Okay.\n",
      "You've got to get those piles out of the living room.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "\"You promised me that you wouldn't clutter the living room.\"\n",
      "And I did promise her, so then I'll clean things up.\n",
      "But on the other hand, we have the big low table in there and it's got as many of her books and magazines on it as I have books.\n",
      "I'm not the only one that makes piles or clutters things.\n",
      "The funny thing is that when people come to visit us, bar none, every single guest says, \"Oh, your house is so comfortable.\n",
      "You're one of the few houses that I go to that I'm completely comfortable in.\"\n",
      "We're bursting at the seams here, so it says something about people, in general.\n",
      "The friends we have are not just like us, so I've come to the conclusion that people like the sense of a house well lived in and even though it's cluttered it's cluttered with things that you the owner like and feel comfortable with and it feels like a home to them.\n",
      "Some people have actually said that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, because it looks actually lived in, right?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "But then it becomes that kind of level like that's great that people are saying that, however, it's clearly getting in the way of you living your normal life.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interesting.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "We both, [NAME 00:34:58] is my partner's name.\n",
      "She used to know some people, well, she still knows them, but they used to have a house up in Massachusetts and occasionally we would go up to visit them.\n",
      "Well, they and this was a huge rambling house, but talk about the feel of clutter and a house lived in.\n",
      "Again, everybody that visited them said the same thing.\n",
      "The [LOCATION 00:35:35] house, oh my God, it's such a rambling old house and it's such a mess and clutter of things but it is so comfortable.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Specifically, because again, it's pretty much the same object, in this case boxes.\n",
      "He has more than one but yet they're different enough that he thinks that for whatever reason, whether he sends out a lot of things or not, if they are different sizes so if one box doesn't fit whatever he's going to send out he'll probably have another that will be even better.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It does say that he's worried that he might get rid of a box that he'll need later, but it says stacks of boxes only occupy one of his closets, but they're not anywhere else.\n",
      "Were you, when we were just talking about clutter, you said, \"Oh, there's like a pile of some stuff that would be more clutter, whereas if there's a lot more items in a lot of other places then it's probably hoarding.\"\n",
      "Do you think that this person has hoarding just having boxes in one place?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think it's the beginning of something that probably will escalate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "I'm going to read another one.\n",
      "John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house he keeps the container the item came in.\n",
      "He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he will need later.\n",
      "Stacks of boxes occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom he must remove several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "His house is extremely cluttered and it is difficult for him to walk in his house.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and his wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he is looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Do you think this person has hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I think it's a combination of both.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Can you tell me a little bit more?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Well, because he keeps these boxes I would say that's hoarding and I would say that because there's stuff located all over his house to the point that he can't find his keys and maybe not ever, or at least for the time that he needs them, that's due to clutter.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Well, this room where I write my book is...\n",
      "Well, I was going to say it's going to get to the point where I won't be able to use the room for all the clutter, but that's not true because my computer is here and I have to use my computer.\n",
      "I have so far kept open a space from the door directly to my keyboard table and a table, kind of a desk, it's actually a table that I use as a desktop.\n",
      "I've left enough space to get to it, but all around me are bookcases full of books.\n",
      "There's a hutch that has space for books and it's full of books.\n",
      "The drawers I recently cleaned out the drawers so I could put things in the drawers, however, I ended up piling bins and books and all kinds of stuff in front of the drawers of this hutch so I can't use the drawers even though some of them are empty.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "It sounds like you do have a pretty considerable amount of clutter, huh?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there any spaces that are open?\n",
      "Are you able to use your kitchen for its purpose, your bed for its purpose or are you kind of-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "The kitchen and the bathroom are pretty void of clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "The living room is pretty good, simply because my partner says, \"You just can't clutter up this living room because we do have guests from time to time, so you've got to keep it clear.\"\n",
      "I'm pretty good about keeping it clear.\n",
      "We don't have that many guests so sometimes I do start piling up stuff and realize that I am making piles so then I take them away.\n",
      "I don't like to sort through them and take, throw some things away and file other things, I'll just pick up the whole pile and move it to here into the study or into my bedroom.\n",
      "My bedroom is pretty cluttered.\n",
      "I have three bookcases in it.\n",
      "I have a piano keyboard.\n",
      "I have a couple of jelly cupboards that I use as a dresser or to store my clothes, but usually I can't get at that those jelly cupboards.\n",
      "Then they end up, anything that I wear if it's not in the closet which I can access, they're thrown on a bin that's in one corner and a basket in another corner.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Seems like you still have functional use, you're not completely unable to use things for their intended purpose but it's a struggle to get around things.\n",
      "You can't reach every area in your home.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "Tell me about-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "The thing is, when we bought this, my partner bought this house, it was a small house and it was okay for us.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so that's what I was going to ask, two bedroom or?\n",
      "Interviewer: Mm-hm.\n",
      "Are they actually true?\n",
      "Interviewee: So “true” is not going to work for hoarding either because it’s not a “true,” right?\n",
      "That’s for delusions.\n",
      "This is where I’d have to dock the BABS.\n",
      "I would change that to saying, “underlying medical or biological cause” not “psychiatric, psychological, or neurological.”\n",
      "I think you’ll get some people say yes, they think it’s an underlying, there’s an underlying biological cause, and I think some will say, “No, I think it’s because of how I grew up.”\n",
      "I think that varies along with just about everything with people, right?\n",
      "Which is that people with more medical or biological or scientific sophistication will have some understanding that this might be a medical or biological problem.\n",
      "And others will not have any awareness of that.\n",
      "And some of that has to do with the fact that this disorder is still not really well known or understood by the lay community or by the medical community as being a biological psychiatric problem.\n",
      "So I think most people will say, “No, it’s not a psychiatric problem.”\n",
      "And I think that is actually something we should adjust in the BABS to really fit our population.\n",
      "I think we’re going to have to look at it, because the BABS was really written for psychosis.\n",
      "Interviewer: [inaudible 21:49] Alright.\n",
      "So the literature surrounding hoarding disorder describes hoarders as often having low insight.\n",
      "How do you define insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Insight is the awareness of what your symptoms are and how they impact you and the world around you.\n",
      "Insight doesn’t have anything to do with the causes of the symptoms.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "I’m going to read another question from the BABS, so how do you think your patients with hoarding disorder would answer this question?\n",
      "“How convinced are you of these ideas or beliefs about the value of things and the impact it has on your life?”\n",
      "Interviewee: Ok that’s going to have to be reworded also.\n",
      "“How convinced are you that you need to keep these things or that some bad will come of discarding them?” A version of that.\n",
      "I think that has to do with varying levels of insight.\n",
      "Some people will say, “I know that I can get rid of it, but I just can’t bring myself to do it.”\n",
      "Some people will say, “I know I need this and sometimes I’m convinced of it, and sometimes I know that I can get rid of it,” and some people will say, “I have to keep everything.”\n",
      "I think that particular thing is an insight question essentially, and it will vary by people.\n",
      "I think we’ll get more of the, “I know at least some of the time I can get rid of it safely,” than the, “I always need to keep it.”\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So you think that that low insight subgroup is –\n",
      "Interviewee: Not going to come in for treatment.\n",
      "Interviewer: Would you say that it’s… that you think prevalence wise or population wise it would probably be a 50/50 split?\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think it’s a spectrum like this.\n",
      "I mean I think there’s some people with very good insight and high motivation, some people with very poor insight or almost delusional, and then most people are kind of in the middle.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know you said that your husband had problems with collecting and stuff, how did that impact your relationship on both sides?\n",
      "On your side and his?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "It was a fight every day about the behavior, and then I would give up.\n",
      "I would say, \"I can't change other people.\"\n",
      "I didn't know how bad it was going to get.\n",
      "I would create one room in which nothing was allowed to be in that room, and then sort of deal with it that way.\n",
      "Then he created a workshop and built it up, nobody was supposed to go in there.\n",
      "I guess it solved slightly by separating rooms out.\n",
      "That's what was happening, because I guess he was happy to own several acres and seven or eight sheds.\n",
      "Where he lives now that's what it's like.\n",
      "I think it's a problem just about every day or every week, you want to face it, you want to do something about it, but nothing gets done.\n",
      "I think it's a major contributor to ongoing problems all the time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How did it effect raising your children and how your kids behave now?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "One of them, she won't admit it though, maybe one of these days, she took psychology.\n",
      "I'm like I can see why you took that.\n",
      "She gets better all the time.\n",
      "If you gave her a choice, I mean we both used to go dumpster diving together.\n",
      "Let's go get something.\n",
      "Let's find some stuff, okay.\n",
      "Actually, she did find one thing that was very valuable.\n",
      "I couldn't understand why she did that, because her dad very much and me somewhat and grandpa, people around here.\n",
      "That's okay, you can go ahead and gather that.\n",
      "Her uncle was a coin collector and collector of old toys and just had everything.\n",
      "I think that influences your babyhood, your childhood and then well, she's only 27 right now.\n",
      "She got a long way to go, but she's moved seven times and the last time it was had to throw everything away.\n",
      "Well, you know what?\n",
      "It might be good.\n",
      "It's stuff and you had to say goodbye to it.\n",
      "It's like heartbreaking for some people.\n",
      "They really don't want to keep moving and throw away their things.\n",
      "I think it influenced her quite a bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are they also actively like trying to change this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Excuse me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are they actively trying to change their behavior so they're not collecting as much?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "That's a good question.\n",
      "I have not asked.\n",
      "I say things like, \"How are you doing?\" I'm afraid to ask her if she's actively changed anything.\n",
      "I would say the little one, the 27 year old, she's appearing to from what she tells me on the phone, yes, having I think forced by circumstances, yes, not by counseling or anything like that, but because she had to.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "We're getting towards the end here, but one of the last questions is would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "Interviewer: So, I kind of want to go back to the first time you learned about CBT, and um what context was that, was it here, was it elsewhere?\n",
      "When did you first here about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: I first learned about it, we are down here from [LOCATION REDACTED], we live in [LOCATION REDACTED], umm I am a neurologist up there umm spoke about and we were recommended to a therapist that was practicing it and then from there we were recommended to a therapist that specialized um specifically using habit reversal []\n",
      "Tourette, and um we drove to [NAME REDACTED] in [LOCATION REDACTED] and started doing some pretty intensive therapy over there and that ultimately led to diagnosis of OCD and that led us down here so it’s kind of been like one thing after another, but I’d say our neurologist in [LOCATION REDACTED] was the first time I’ve ever heard about this and that was probably… I don’t know maybe three, three four years ago maybe the first we kind of heard of.\n",
      "Speaker: Um Probably in college I mean as far as very loosely I mean, I heard of it because I had been a psych major prior to going to nursing school but, um but it wasn’t, I really didn’t know what it was about until we started therapy.\n",
      "Interviewer: When you first heard about it were there any questions that you had about CBT, and if so what where they?\n",
      "Speaker: Umm…I needed some specifics you know, I really didn’t know anything about it umm….\n",
      "The doctor just kind of loosely, you know talked about it but it wasn’t enough for me to really feel like [10:38] ___ so I did some research on it.\n",
      "I didn’t really umm… I though ok this seems cool you know, I hope it’s helpful you know for people but I just that was about it and I thought you know we will see if the proof is in the pudding.\n",
      "Interviewer: Do you remember what you’re a doctor was saying about CBT the first time you were speaking with them, does anything come to mind in terms of ?\n",
      "Speaker: I just remember him saying that and this may have been more about habit rehearsal therapy which kind of falls under the umbrella right of CBT.\n",
      "That is was a newer type of therapy the habit rehearsal and that it was a type of therapy use that did not involve medication and that it was a new thing that not many people knew how to do it but more people were learning.\n",
      "It was really catching on and um that’s all I really remember.\n",
      "You know, not a whole lot from him, yeah.\n",
      "Other than he highly recommended it.\n",
      "Interviewer: And you also mentioned research as well.\n",
      "Speaker: I just when I say research, I just mean I like went on the internet.\n",
      "I was like alright what does [11:48] ___ actually mean, how long has all this been around.\n",
      "I watched a couple of videos of people doing habit rehearsal therapy for Tourette’s syndrome.\n",
      "Umm they were I think filmed in England [12:00] __, they were both filmed in England the one I saw.\n",
      "Umm and it was interesting, just to get an idea.\n",
      "I was like what exactly am I going to put my child through.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, right.\n",
      "Did you have similar experiences in terms of like how doctors recommended or for your child or anytime you looked up what CBT was all about?\n",
      "Speaker: Um I did do research on the internet just like what you did.\n",
      "Um no, I mean… I guess… I… It just it seems to be pretty intuitive It sort of like a desensitization you just, you know, you become desensitize to things you exposure yourself to so, I thought and I heard that there was a lot success so the thing that really you know concerns me is that my child is so young so will he have the ability you know to have the insight into you know doing this type of therapy.\n",
      "So…that’s been hard.\n",
      "Yeah, it’s been hard.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, there may be having one of something and enjoying that, rather than feeling like you had to have the whole set, all of them in that grouping.\n",
      "Or people who would make do with an acrylic template used for cutting with a rotary cutter.\n",
      "They would not rush out the purchase it.\n",
      "I think long and hard, and then eventually get it.\n",
      "Might as well just get it in the first place.\n",
      "Someone's without a hoarding problem would not bother with it because I wouldn't do it now necessarily, but I might need it someday.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So someone without hoarding disorder might not buy something that they won't need for a while?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Or they won't be at all.\n",
      "They'd just make do around it.\n",
      "But this thing that I would purchase would be very useful.\n",
      "If they were going to do something that's in touch, and they would get it.\n",
      "I was learning how to crack pistachios, how to get pistachios out of the shell, and I looked at them, and I thought, \"Oh, those look like coquina shells.\n",
      "They would make really nice necklaces.\"\n",
      "My husband says, \"No, you don't.\"\n",
      "And I said, \"Well, I wasn't going to save them, truly, but they would make nice necklaces.\"\n",
      "Pistachio shells.\n",
      "That would be one difference.\n",
      "They wouldn't even think of that.\n",
      "It wouldn't even cross their minds.\n",
      "That's trash.\n",
      "It goes there.\n",
      "It's oceans of future possibilities that make me get something.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So someone with maybe normal saving behavior may say, \"This is trash.\n",
      "I'm going to throw this away,\" but someone with hoarding disorder may say, \"I could use that for something\"?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It sounds like you've done some research kind of on hoarding disorder before.\n",
      "Where do you get information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Where do I get information?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, ma'am.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Mostly books.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mostly books.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "There's that Trash to Treasure.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "Not Tethered to a Cord.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So some books like Trash to Treasure, Not Tethered to a Cord?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Wait a minute.\n",
      "I thought they were right there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I thought I had the books right there in one spot, but they must be in a different spot.\n",
      "Anyway, let's see.\n",
      "I've done three or four books.\n",
      "Shadows I cannot bring out of my brain.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "Did you find that the-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "But each one has a certain slant to it.\n",
      "A different idea.\n",
      "And I think, \"Oh, that makes sense.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you think that they were helpful or informative?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Every book that I read had a different take on it about why do you have problems, and I think, \"Oh, yeah,\" but I don't know anything.\n",
      "I just read the book.\n",
      "I like books.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you heard of hoarding disorder in any other context?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "Dream, dream, dream.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "The thing that I'm connected with is and have what I think of in my way of thinking of order is my garden and I work it in everyday and when I don't work, it's my clutter.\n",
      "Do I avoid it?\n",
      "Yeah, I guess it would be everything filed in one really small file cabinet or some drawers that have labels, that would be good.\n",
      "That would indicate these items are being used and not to have any... I guess the goal would be items that have no use and are not useful.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I know that you mentioned that you like to spend time in the garden.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "I don't know how to word this question.\n",
      "How important is it for you to feel at home with your things and which objects do you spend the most time with?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "The most time with?\n",
      "I guess I divide my time between everything lately.\n",
      "I'll do bookwork or something, looking for documents, that's a time waster, I'll be looking for lost stuff, trying to organize it, throw it away.\n",
      "It could be three hours, three times a week, but then I will go to the pleasant hard work that is outdoors and do that agriculture stuff in my garden, almost every day, maybe five to six days a week I'll work on that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of this time you're spending, which is the most important to you?\n",
      "Working with your files, outside or maybe something else?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "That's a good question too.\n",
      "I think it's changing.\n",
      "I think I'm undergoing a change with it, because I know it's time for a change and I know change is good.\n",
      "I'll try to close up what I'm doing and go... I guess I'm a little ADD.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "I've been told I am.\n",
      "I'll just kind of walk away from one thing and do the other thing if that makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You don't have like maybe a preference?\n",
      "There's not one that's the most important to you?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "That's a good question.\n",
      "Is it really?\n",
      "I think doing the agriculture in the garden, that's a lifelong project too.\n",
      "Sometimes I teach people how to do that.\n",
      "If I really need to put a number one thing, that would be it, if I could categorize it, if I could prioritize it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "When you think about your possessions, what makes them valuable?\n",
      "How do you determine their value?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "When I think about my possessions how do you determine their value?\n",
      "For example, we'll say I have seeds for the garden and more than I need.\n",
      "I determine their value, because I thought that I needed those, but I also thought somebody else, I need to share this and someone else will need it.\n",
      "I think that's what I base it on.\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh okay well NAME (7:15) is a social work um she works at the unit- social work PHD and works at the UNIVERSITY (7:24) um and she does a lot of qualitative work and um and and I think its uh provides such a richer nuanced kind of perspective um that then from there you can go on to use that knowledge that that rich data that you gather to develop something that is a little more quantitative but tis more kind of informed quantitative right um it's not just whatever I'm envisioning and coming up with um so so initially what I have been thinking about it's that it would be interesting to kind of even just think about a case sample of uh you know yes the experts but then you know like a first year medical resident would be really interesting person to kind of think through ‘have you heard of hoarding?’ ‘is that something you would think about asking about?’ um ‘why do you think that would matter?’ you know like all that type of stuff um you know somebody who's going into social work who have not had exposure to hoarding which is ninety percent of social workers out there just because it's not taught in the curriculum uh you know your average kind of researched based clinical psychologist um you know same thing on that end um and then from there thinking though like where are our gaps is it dissemination about information about hoarding?\n",
      "Um but then also how could that impact the patients care and patient health care seeking behavior I guess um yeah so that just kind of some of my initial thoughts so maybe we can circle back um after the interview, what do you guys think?\n",
      "P2: Yeah\n",
      "P1: Yeah\n",
      "P2: Um just to kind of build off that before we move into the interview and I agree I think that we have a lot of interest in common it would be interesting to me to think about I had not even thought about it until just now, using our interviews to develop a survey and then kind of doing a wider survey but that’s uh that could be that could be a productive use of our data in the future once were done with the interviews to kind of say okay what do we want to ask about un in the survey and how do we want to phrase questions, that might be something to talk about also um but yeah let's circle back to it after you’ve heard our interview and got a chance to talk though kind of more and see what kind of information were gathering\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay that sounds great\n",
      "Interviewer: So one of the ideas behind talking about clutter is that the space is filled and that’s a problem, but are their people for whom they don’t need to have as much free space in their home in order to live with a sense of ease or comfort?\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh sure.\n",
      "And I think that the key is not volume of space, but the space is not usable.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "So things piled on top of the stove is different than knickknacks on the counter.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "So usable space is determined by the individual, but there are also certain things for which, and this, again, gets to kind of cultural norms, whatever the environment that you live in, and etcetera.\n",
      "So somebody whose bed is filled with pillows that go off the bed at night is different than somebody whose bed is filled with papers, and they sleep in a corner of the bed.\n",
      "So again, it’s what is on the counter, let’s say, and is it there deliberately or is it there for lack of space?\n",
      "And those are fundamental differences.\n",
      "It’s not what’s… it’s not how much is on the counter, but why is it there and can you use the counter.\n",
      "Some people don’t cook and so then their counters can be filled with things.\n",
      "There also is a very big difference between collectionism, which is deliberate, and hoarding, which is because of a difficulty.\n",
      "I mean there is excessive acquisition in people with hoarding, but people who collect go out and look for specific things, and they get pleasure from that particular thing, and, you know, they organize and arrange, etcetera.\n",
      "That’s a very different phenomenon.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Kind of going back to something that you mentioned, you know, if someone doesn’t cook, for example, their stove might have things on it, and so with the phrase in the DSM “substantially compromising intended use.”\n",
      "Is that kind of a cultural intended use or is that this individual’s intended use?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think it’s kind of both, right?\n",
      "Somebody who doesn’t cook but has papers on the stove still puts themselves at risk.\n",
      "Somebody who doesn’t cook but has repurposed the stove into something else, that’s different, right?\n",
      "So to some degree it’s the individuals, and so this gets to the insight as well, but… And this is tricky for all the psychiatric illnesses, which is, how much of it is driven by the individual and how much of it is driven by our current society?\n",
      "Delusions and schizophrenia are a good example of that.\n",
      "Although, for schizophrenia, even though there are cultural norms and things are more accepted in some cultures than in others, there’s still this kind of core symptomatology that’s seen and accepted across all cultures, and I think probably the same is true for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Which is, if the living area is unsafe or unsanitary or piled in a non-deliberate manner, then that would probably qualify.\n",
      "So it wasn't too hard for me to decide the thing to do for me was to accept this [inaudible 00:16:34] offer where my son-in-law used to take care of problems in the air conditioning, he used to hire contractors to do this or that, to fix some of the problems around the house.\n",
      "All I had to do is walk around in rubble.\n",
      "Sorry, that's a bit of a exaggeration but one nice thing about moving down to Cyprus was nobody knew me before my medical event and so they didn't wonder what happened to me and the accepted me as a new person, and I think part of my problem with my several IQ droppage was taking maybe a year and a half to recover from the anesthesia.\n",
      "I had four abdominal operations and there was ...\n",
      "It's a bit of a story but you don't need the details so I'm ...\n",
      "I had four abdominal operations and I still have a ventral hernia as a reminder.\n",
      "So here I am, I basically happy where I am.\n",

      "[crosstalk 00:17:32].\n",

      "[crosstalk 00:17:35]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you had a lot of health issues going on at the same time that maybe made it a little bit easier for you to let go of your house and all your stuff because you recognized that you couldn't-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",

      "I [inaudible 00:17:48].\n",
      "I used to be an engineer.\n",
      "One of the things I never wanted to do was just be in the vehicle with [inaudible 00:17:55] broParticipant 036 belt or a broParticipant 036 hose.\n",
      "Those are things like if were bent pretty easily by replacing those just before it failed, and so about once year I would [inaudible 00:18:05] this particular [inaudible 00:18:06] I had a state 1500 Chevy pick-up, it's a four wheel drive half ton pick-up and every year I had to replace the water radiator hoses and the heater hoses.\n",
      "Check if the fan belt work perfectly, belt and just my general principles and ride it for another year not being concerned about it breaking on me.\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "It varies.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",

      "Participant 040:\n",

      "I'm beginning to see cause and effect and if I have someone to be accountable to, and I'm working on that, then I can say that person or people, \"Well, I threw a bunch of stuff away and I got detached from this stuff and I put some stuff out of the way where I couldn't add to it.\"\n",

      "Interviewee: So so insight is very interesting because obviously it's like the I don’t get that I have a problem and its so not on my radar and the extremes of that we have squalor and animal hoarding but I really think of those as kind of being something kinda different like it just kind of feels very different um almost a little bit more like psychosis um your more garden variety hoarding disorder patient will also have variable insight but the thing that I find so fascinating about that insight is that it is so variable and its like this floating insight an it think that it we don’t have a good way of defining what exactly it is like we haven’t fully operationalized what we mean by insight and you know there’s the part where it like ‘yeah I know I have a issue and I can acknowledge that but I really like my stuff and so you push too much on my stuff um I'm going to push back again with that’ right?\n",
      "‘like I'm not going to fully agree with you’ uh it's that part where they kind of stick their heels in the mud and it’s a hard forward and is that because the really don’t get it or is it because they feel like why are you pushing me like that?\n",
      "Uh those are two very different things right so certainly what I'm working on with patients clinically is and when I'm supervising um the groups I think it gets really tricky to be able to kind of roll with that and I think about it the same way I think about insight for someone who is struggling with an eating disorder or a substance abuse problem which is that is variable and floating\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. When you're thinking about those most precious items, why are they valuable?\n",
      "What makes them the most valuable over everything else?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Because it's how I communicate with people, and then it's part of who I am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So let's say instead of the house is on fire, let's say you lost it.\n",
      "What would happen?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "If I lost it?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Like if I lost my phone or I lost my purse, I would have to get another one, but it would be extremely stressful for the time being, but all those things can be replaced.\n",
      "It's hard that you lose those certain things, but they can be replaced.\n",
      "It's more so the body that can't be replaced, so I understand that it's a material item.\n",
      "Yeah, it sucks that something happened to it, but you can always get another one.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you have any possessions that you don't think could be replaced?\n",
      "Like if you lost it-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "The more personal ones, like the stuffed animal, the family pictures.\n",
      "Some stuff there's only one of, so once they're gone, they're gone.\n",
      "Like when we moved, I didn't realize but I accidentally threw away some letters from my dad and those are gone.\n",
      "So it's like, \"Okay, well those are gone.\"\n",
      "It's going to stick with me forever, but it is what it is.\n",
      "As us millennials say, it is what it is, so what else can you do?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so how would you value those items compared to your purse or your phone?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "It's more of a sentimental value.\n",
      "It was sad that I lost those items, but ... I have pictures.\n",
      "I mean, it's okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I mean it's not okay, but it's like, it was my fault that I lost them.\n",
      "That should've been the first thing I put away, but I didn't take care of them the correct way in the first place.\n",
      "If I took care of them in the correct way in the first place when I was not being organized, because when I got them I wasn't being organized; I had just put them on a bookcase.\n",
      "I didn't put them [inaudible 00:24:28] just put letters out and they fell behind the dresser when my bookcase was moved, and then I put them somewhere.\n",
      "They got left behind, so that was my fault.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I know how difficult that can be, when you think back when you lost something.\n",
      "You're like, \"Oh, if I had just done something different ...\"\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah. But I never ever made much money so that didn't last too long.\n",
      "Some of these outlets started, like Sierra Trading Post, that would send you a catalog of shoes that were, what do they call them, seconds?\n",
      "Sometimes these seconds are seconds only because the lot happened to have a lot in them that were not as perfect but yet you end up... I have some shoes that I got from Sierra Trading Post as a second that have lasted me forever.\n",
      "They've never worn out.\n",
      "I'm not a person that's hard on shoes so I can wear a...\n",
      "In fact, I've got on a pair of shoes, pair of ECCO training shoes or what do you call them, the British call them trainers, but anyway, their not tennis shoes either.\n",
      "You know, recreational type shoe.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "So you got pairs of shoes-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I bought these shoes six years ago and I'm still wearing them.\n",
      "There not in the best of shape but I'm still wearing them.\n",
      "I'm not hard on shoes.\n",
      "I started buying a lot of these seconds and sometimes I would go into T.J.\n",
      "Maxx and would find them and I would buy them.\n",
      "Well, recently I have started to get rid of them.\n",
      "Most of them I never wore.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now you're starting to get rid of your shoes.\n",
      "Okay, what makes your possessions valuable?\n",
      "It seems like you really value these shoes, what makes them more valuable than other items?\n",
      "How do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Well, I just don't differentiate.\n",
      "It's just something will occur to me that I like.\n",
      "For instance, I started wearing bow ties about three, four years ago.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "And I found a particular model or brand of bow ties on Amazon and I bought every bow tie this particular company sold.\n",
      "I haven't even worn some of them.\n",
      "My excuse now is that I hardly ever go any place.\n",
      "When I lead a book club and so forth, when I would actually go out I would wear my bow tie.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so you really like bow ties, as well?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Some of these things just tickle my fancy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "And when I started losing a lot of weight I decided, well, instead of wearing a belt I'll wear suspenders, so I went through a binge of buying suspenders.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So you kind of get hooked on maybe items of fashion or something like that and you start collecting a lot of them.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's not particularly fashion driven, it's just that it's something that I think I want for a practical reason, like instead of the belt I wear suspenders.\n",
      "I can't satisfy myself with just buying one or two, I have to buy as many as my budget will allow.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I just would like for me to really continue to work on having [inaudible 00:15:51] because in the past, which made things difficult to keep organized, is I would keep paper and body care items in one place.\n",
      "So if I was looking for a body care item and I couldn't find it, I would just go and buy double or triple of something.\n",
      "Now I've been really focusing on, \"Okay, I have this or I have this.\n",
      "I know where it is,\" so I can easily go find it instead of having to go through this whole thing of where to find it.\n",
      "So, I know where 80% of my stuff is and now I'm trying to get to where I know where 90% of my stuff is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So how important would you say your things are for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Very important because, I mean a hotel is one thing but you want to feel comfortable in your home.\n",
      "I feel very comfortable.\n",
      "Now it's just using up this stuff that I have so it's not so \"this is a lot.\"\n",
      "I'm looking at my room, \"Okay, I see some more stuff I can do.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So which things or which objects would you say are most important for you and that you spend most of your time with?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Well my Fire Stick.\n",
      "I use that a lot.\n",
      "My clothes.\n",
      "I wear those.\n",
      "I've been wearing a lot of the same stuff because I'm not going anywhere.\n",
      "My, oh.\n",
      "That was a flashlight.\n",
      "Clothes and my body care, because I have sensitive skin so I have to be very careful of the different things that I use.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:17:42] makeup and nail polish, and of course family pictures and purses.\n",
      "I have some heirlooms and stuff that I was given, so I have a lot of pictures of deceased family members and different stuff, so those are important to me, and then the makeup and stuff that I wear, and purses too, and jewelry.\n",
      "I don't know, it's a lot of stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So when you think about all these possessions, what makes them valuable and how do you determine if an object is valuable or not?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t I don’t the hoarding depression distinctions that difficult I think that’s pretty easy um but the one that I think does get a little bit tricky is if they have OCD and hoarding um and being able to like tease apart which hoarding behavior is linked to OCD verses what is linked to hoarding disorder I think that gets a little bit tricky\n",
      "P1: We had a participant like that yesterday actually INAUDIBLE (1:03:31) that you mentioned that it is very challenging\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah interesting mhm\n",
      "P2: Mhm INAUDIBLE (1:03:36)\n",
      "Interviewee: INAUDIBLE (1:03:36) What I say to my students is that if you go back to why are they saving?\n",
      "why are they attached to the objects?\n",
      "then I think it becomes a little clearer it just depends on how much insight the patient has give you answers to that if it comes down to they just like their stuff (laughing) you know then it's pretty clear its hoarding\n",
      "P2: Um mhm NAME (1:04:02) do you want to move into the DSM five questions?\n",
      "P1: Yeah okay\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (1:04:06)\n",
      "P1: Yeah exactly so you had brought up the DSM five criteria and we actually have some specific questions that we want to ask you about the specific elements in the DSM five criterion and how you imply them and employ them in your practice and your research so uh the first phrase that we wanted to mention was persistent difficulty discarding or parting possession regardless of their values and so with this we kind of wanted to get you how you’re deeming value and what makes the values judgment a hoarding patient makes inappropriate?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um I mean so the way that we usually first we always ask if they have any difficulties with discarding um objects or belongings and if the person says yes to that we always ask for examples um what are the types of things you have difficulties discarding and um if someone were to say my Faberge eggs or (laughing) I don’t know whatever my you know my eighteen hundreds stamp collection um then we would ask the follow up question are there any other types of objects you have a hard time letting go of um so I thick there is a very obvious aspect of value that has to do with just in general with most people think that that something you should hang on to um and and if not then I kind of seeing how extensive it is like are there multiple objects um I think that’s really kind of the crux its not only that they have a hard time discarding um baggies for or the only have a hard time discarding take out containers like a hoarding patient has difficulties discarding a range of objects and again that threshold for how many of these objects they have is tends to be a lot higher then yes I sometimes save takeout containers as well but I have maybe like two of them versus you know so many that you have this cluttered living space\n",
      "P2: Mhm\n",
      "P1: Um you kind of mentioned something that leads into a second question that we have that relates to space uh so for healthy individuals even there is a degree of variance in the amount of space that you like in your home so some might like to have a clear desk while others might prefer to have things out and ready to use do you feel like hoarding disorder could be an extension of that variance that surpasses the acceptable threshold you know we had another interviewer say ‘some people just want to be surrounded by their things’ and live more cave like if you will you mentioned that word\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah totally I think it's a spectrum I don’t think we are looking at an extreme taxon here\n",
      "P2: Hm\n",
      "P1: Hm okay um\n",
      "P2: Um\n",
      "P1: Go ahead NAME (1:15:32)\n",
      "P2: Okay the last criterion yeah just to I think we’ll wrap up the questions we had about the DSM five and then we’ll get another time on your calendar if that’s okay um the last criteria we wanted to have to talk through for us was the just the difficulties with the perceived need to save the items and the distress associated with discarding them and we wanted to talk about how you determine the distress with this disorder how do you determine how much distress with discarding is normal or abnormal is it a grey area and in particular is a grey area for patients that might have low insight and not really be aware of how difficult they have um the difficulties they have with discarding\n",
      "Interviewee: Um I think it probably becomes a grey area for sub-clinical folks but I I usually don’t find it so grey for people who definitely have hoarding disorder\n",
      "P2: Mhm\n",
      "Interviewee: Um I think that INAUDIBLE (1:16:46)\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (1:16:46) Go ahead\n",
      "Interviewee: The part when I'm training like you know my super newbie graduate students is that they have it in their mind that distress comes in like one from so we do have to talk about that distress can come in the guise as anger can come in the guise and anxiety can come in the guise as like grief you know there’s like a range of emotion that can reflect or capture that distress and as long as you are kind of thinking about it in that perspective then you know then I think that the other part that probably is when it does kind of start to get tricky is when they haven’t been exposed to having to discard right like it has not occurred to them that they need to get rid of anything um and so they haven’t really elicited the distress um in any sort of concrete way\n",
      "P2: U yeah so that kind of is leads us to our next topic but I think we finally should stop before we move into our next larger issue um which we wanted to talk about was insight and what insight means and what relation with these patients but I think kind of to be respectful to everybody's time but to also save a little bit of time for um just closing up the interview let's stop there and then maybe we can find another time to get on your calendar if that’s okay with you\n",
      "P1: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewee: Sure yeah no that works\n",
      "P1: I think that the question is kind of moving forward now is how we might want to collaborate on this project how we might move forward\n",
      "I just took my tools.\n",
      "I do have some problems, medical issues.\n",
      "It's [inaudible 00:14:42] to use hand tools like I did at one time and no they just took pretty much what they wanted and took them.\n",
      "So they took ...\n",
      "They had memories too up here, tearing the pictures off the wall, that sort of thing.\n",
      "And I sold the house, I took a pretty big hit on selling the house because I left all the clutter in it and that made the house hard to sell.\n",
      "So I took a substantial [inaudible 00:15:09] count on it but like I really care anyway.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:15:12] it's only money.\n",
      "I care les about money than I do stuff I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "That sounds like a huge step.\n",
      "I think you should feel really good about the fact that you were able to let all that stuff go.\n",
      "A lot of people really struggle with that but it sounds like you were able to just say, \"Okay, it's not that important.\n",
      "My kids are right.\"\n",
      "And just walk away from the house and start a new life.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Well, that's pretty much what I had to do and that was made a little easier because, I've had some minor brain damage.\n",
      "I had a little oxygen [inaudible 00:15:41] to find the substances.\n",
      "The nurses told me I hit the 85% mortality rate.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "So I wasn't quite the same guy I used to be.\n",
      "I walked out of the hospital with maybe a 30/50 IQ drop.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh my gosh.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "A 30/50 points lower IQ-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I can't imagine you before that because you are a very sharp gentleman right now.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:16:07] but I know for sure, I was thinking about a rate about 130, the average person and [inaudible 00:16:15] gives me very poor [inaudible 00:16:18].\n",
      "So I fall over [inaudible 00:16:19].\n",
      "You have to think really fast to just keep from falling over and some other side issues like that that made my life more difficult.\n",
      "Interviewee: Great question so and I think that there um we just finished a study looking at the dimension of hoarding uh or rather saving behaviors um so that’s something that I'm very interested in because I'm particularly fascinated by who are these people when they are young?\n",
      "so before they are sixty-five and coming in to out treatment programs or our study protocols who are these people when they are like twenty?\n",
      "(laughing) where are they?\n",
      "What do they look like?\n",
      "And I think a really important piece to understanding that is knowing what is normative saving and what is is not normative saving and the cool notion about collecting I think its really fascinating and so in six months I’ll have more concrete answers for you guys about what I think really distinguishes uh abnormal from normal behaviors um and I'm not sure if our hypothesis are going to to pan out I mean the most obvious thing is the level of like the threshold at which you save something and the threshold at which you let something go that is much higher for hoarding patients then it is for those of us who don’t have hoarding um I also think that the rigidity with regard to saving rules is also one of the factors that differentiate and then seeing value in things I think it’s the other piece that is going to really differentiate normal from abnormal\n",
      "P2: You you're doing a study that is related to the kind of early lives of hoarders or are you more looking at this boundary between normal and abnormal saving behaviors what when you say that I'm not sure\n",
      "Interviewee: Both both\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (46:07) okay so what specifically are you doing if you don’t mind\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah so we well first of all I'm really interested in these young adults and college students are these really fascinating group because it’s the first time they are living alone but they are still living in this fairly controlled environments um so better understanding which of those students are doing to go on to become our eventual hoarding patients is is something that I'm really curious about and and importantly our core diagnosis criteria of clutter is absolutely worthless with that group of young adults cause they A haven’t had time to collect enough stuff and B they’re living in controlled environment they are living in like a two by two foot dorm room with a roommate (laughing) um and so none of these students would meet for clutter like none of them so they wouldn’t get the diagnoses of hoarding so we absolutely see difficulties discarding um and a lot of the similar features that we see with like like clinical hoarding patients like the older patients we also see with these younger kids um so that’s part of it another study that we did but isn’t really related to that is that we recruited eighteen gender match healthy control and then collectors people who do not meet the diagnosis for hoarding but they have a collection and they identity has a collector and then hoarding disorder patients so we basically artificially created a dimension um by oversampling those three groups\n",
      "P2: Okay um well that the bulk of our interview right there um we just wanted to kind of close out with a very broad kind of general question um what you think that the biggest things that we still don’t know about hoarding disorder are or uh if you could answer one question about hoarding disorder which one would you pick where you think the most important research could be\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh my god um I’ll be here forever if I answer that but I really don’t know I think it's so fascinating its like you know I started studying it almost by accident back in like you know early 2000’s and here I am still looking at it um I think that the most important that thing we can do in navigating hoarding research in moving forward is getting out of the mindset of this being an OC spectrum disorder um I think that it hoarding has grown up so much um from with in the shadow of of OCD that is has shaped a lot of how we conceptualize this condition and how we conceptualize the symptoms and the INAUDIBLE (1:49:40) and the validity everything an the more that we are learning about hoarding the more I think that we need to stop doing that it is almost like this perfect storm disorder where you get you know high levels of depression high levels of anxiety you have these personality features you have executive function deficits you have like everything um and it just I think that part of the reason why it's so challenging um yeah but so I I don’t make me pick one answer (laughing)\n",
      "P1: Okay\n",
      "P2: Okay that’s that’s fair um and we talked about a lot of different issues too over the course of this interview um I really appreciate your time and and um this was just really a great interview and um I think that a lot of the things that you have it was great and um validity and wonderful to have you kind of predict the questions that we were going to ask because I think that uh we’re interested in uh the same kind of questions in terms of insight and in terms of how the diagnostic criteria are applied um I don’t know if you want to talk now about next steps for us um or if\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean I think\n",
      "P2: Want to think about it\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that um so so where I'm at right is that if there’s a role for me as a your collaborator or you know more lose consultant um I'm I I certainly think that this is really important and have been wanting to do something along these lines for for a while so I'm game but I but also so you guys are also at a point of study where maybe you don’t really need any more cooks in the kitchen that’s perfectly okay and we could re-circle you know once you know maybe um that fact that maybe you could use some these interviews to really develop a larger survey um to you know kind of think about interviewing different types of folks not just experts but the people who are actually because there are such few experts so who are the people who are interacting with these patients on a daily basis?\n",
      "um we can always revisit this at that time\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative),So I want to return to something that you told me before we even started the interview.\n",
      "So you said it was getting really bad when you had your house but your kids had an intervention, could you tell me about that?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "My wife and I had a pretty nice house in beautiful Golden, Colorado along the side of South Table Mountain and 2,000 square foot organic [inaudible 00:12:19] blah, blah, blah.\n",
      "Just a nice middle-class house.\n",
      "Good views, I liked it just fine so my wife picked it out, she liked it too.\n",
      "Anyway she dies and my children ...\n",
      "We have three children who grew up in this house, one boy and two girls.\n",
      "They moved on, they're adults.\n",
      "They're older, they're adults and they would come visit and it got to the point where they'd come visit me and my dog, Betty, and they'd look around the house and get a room at the local motel, didn't want the children coming into that clutter and that stuff, and that's when it ...\n",
      "It reached the point where they actually got to together and explained to me very nicely, [inaudible 00:13:10] is really a problem and all the bedrooms that they weren't in anymore full of stuff, and they were right.\n",
      "I [inaudible 00:13:18] that.\n",
      "So I sold my house, no place to go, our daughter, \"[inaudible 00:13:24] with.\n",
      "I hope you build a new house.\"\n",
      "And here I am.\n",
      "So it was not a legal intervention, it was just a matter of getting together and talking to me saying, \"Listen.\"\n",
      "And I'm luckily enough to have rationale children, they're very ...\n",
      "They're fortunate to take after their mother in that aspect, I think.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I was just going to say, it sounds like you have lovely children.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Oh, I do.\n",
      "The biggest problem I have with my adult children.\n",
      "Is, it's hard for me to talk about it without sounding like I'm bragging.\n",
      "It's difficult for me to be modest and honest regarding my children, but anyway, so what I did do was I said, \"Okay, new start.\"\n",
      "And after a while, it was getting hard.\n",
      "I found myself I had more people to come over to visit me, really a problem and happy with that too.\n",
      "To get back on my what little social life I have because [inaudible 00:14:18] that the ...\n",
      "So when all three adult children show up one day and actually spend a couple days, go through the house and the basement.\n",
      "We had a basement full of books and stuff.\n",
      "[inaudible 00:14:30] stuff to the basement, take what they wanted and let them divvy up how they wanted it.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I'm very appreciative.\n",
      "I don't want to make it seem like it's all negative because living with family has helped me a lot; it's been a blessing and a beneficial thing, but it's just those little things sometimes that are a bit irksome.\n",
      "We tell each other this all the time.\n",
      "It's not like whatever I'm saying to you I haven't said to my mom [crosstalk 00:37:09].\n",
      "[inaudible 00:37:09], \"Mom, why are you making me do this?\" [inaudible 00:37:10], \"You don't need all this stuff.\"\n",
      "I'm like, \"Okay.\"\n",
      "Then she was like, \"I have to do it too,\" which is good because some people don't have that, like my ex.\n",
      "He definitely didn't have that.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "So yeah, it's just the frustration of having to go through all this stuff.\n",
      "I'm like, \"Geez, I have way too much stuff.\"\n",
      "I have to sit and go through so much stuff to figure out, \"Okay, am I going to keep this or am I not going to keep this?\", or you do this good job of getting rid of a whole bunch of stuff, and then a month or two later, you need the stuff that you gave away, you donated.\n",
      "It's like, \"Ugh, now I have to go and buy this again?\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, that can be frustrating.\n",
      "So do you think this behavior's ever gotten in the way of your daily life or gotten in the way of something that you really wanted?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "When I was in Maryland, yeah, because I was getting depressed.\n",
      "I had just gone through a break-up.\n",
      "I was having issues with my boyfriend at the time, and that is where my cluttering came to a head because it was really bad.\n",
      "I could barely open the door.\n",
      "You could open the door, but opening it full because, my room setup was different too but I had a pile of clean clothes here, pile of clean clothes there.\n",
      "It just was getting out of control.\n",
      "One time it was so bad, I even had clean clothes on the bed and slept with clean clothes on my bed.\n",
      "I'm like, I never did that before.\n",
      "So that's when it got bad, and I didn't really want to do anything.\n",
      "I was always cleaning, but nothing was tangibly changing in my opinion.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So what would you say it got in the way of?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Just being able to enjoy my room and do crafts because I like to do crafts, but since my room was such a mess, I really wasn't able to sit on the floor and do coloring or do crochet or cross-stitch because there was no place to sit in my room because there was something on every surface, whether the bed or the little seated area that I had in my room.\n",
      "There was something on every part of my room.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "But what I did do, this was deliberate was if you get to be a big person.\n",
      "Big clothes are hard to find for guys, and what I did do with intent, was I burned my ships, down at Lake Cortez there by the guts of Mexico.\n",
      "So I used their starters.\n",
      "The crew was going to go home again without him so he burned all the ships of his day and he wound up here.\n",
      "And until they built these ships and went home eventually ...\n",
      "So in kind of a long about way I boxed up my own 54 size pants and my 52s, 4XL shirts and stuff like that and gave those things away.\n",
      "And, that was deliberately not si I could roll back into it.\n",
      "I tried to make a [inaudible 00:27:55].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, you said, \"I'm getting rid of these because I don't ever want to use them again.\"\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Right, I wanted to ake a sacrifice.\n",
      "If get so fat, I wear [inaudible 00:28:00] you want me to give I go and [inaudible 00:28:02] try to do something dramatic.\n",
      "Just that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds like for you it's easier to get rid of stuff when you know that you're not going to use it again, and instead of-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Oh, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "... putting it in the trash you prefer to give it away to a charity.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yes, ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Now I want to ask you a little bit about hoarding disorder in general.\n",
      "I don't know if you've ever heard of it outside of these conversations or the research that you've participated in, but do you know about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Well, I know a fair amount about it, ma'am.\n",
      "I know for sure it runs in families for some people.\n",
      "I don't think that's necessarily true for everybody, unlike [inaudible 00:28:49] which is your propensity.\n",
      "It [inaudible 00:28:54] down by it but as a good example, ma'am.\n",
      "I went to visit, I have a in Denver, Colorado, my father's youngest ...\n",
      "Younger sister I should say, and a single lady.\n",
      "I went to [inaudible 00:29:06] she has a problem, with hanging on to stuff.\n",
      "That's a problem for her but it's easier for me to see it than her, but I want to see her one time and had these magazines stacked up outside her closet.\n",
      "It gets cold in Denver in the wintertime.\n",
      "So I said, \"Aunt Helen, do you want me to move these magazines so you can get to your closet magazines?\"\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok so, thanks with um meeting me, for meeting with me today.\n",
      "Um, I working with a group of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists on a project about cognitive behavioral therapy which is the kind of therapy that your child or children um have been, uh receiving at this clinic.\n",
      "For this project we want to develop uh few short educational videos to describe what cognitive therapy… cognitive behavioral therapy is for children and their parents uhh so we want to get your information on this topic.\n",
      "Um cognitive behavioral therapy is a mouthful so, throughout this interview I will be calling it CBT, for short.\n",
      "So, to start um could you guys tell me what comes to your mind when you first think about CBT.\n",
      "Speaker: Challenges (laughs)\n",
      "Interviewer: Challenges\n",
      "Speaker: Challenges, yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you elaborate on that.\n",
      "Speaker: Um, challenging… doing things that you know um, challenging your child to do things that they feel uncomfortable doing so that they become more comfortable with um…different things like um touching gross things or… whatever.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I, I think about um very similarly the challenges that the child and the parent will face and the child being faced with something that’s gonna change the way they think.\n",
      "You know\n",
      "Interviewer: Right\n",
      "Speaker: And that may… or may not always work just because someone gets the CBT therapy it doesn’t mean everything is going to be fine afterwards, you know.\n",
      "It’s it’s changing the structure of the thought process and that’s always kind of a grey area.\n",
      "Interviewer: hmmm, So that kind of goes into my next question of like how would you explain what CBT is, like the mechanisms, how does it work?\n",
      "From your perspectives.\n",
      "Speaker: Well [01:50] ___ for us it’s been um… more of like there’s a problem and then an idea is presented um… as a solution but in order to, the way its presented, in order to really receive that idea as a change the patient, the child has to be willing to accept the fact, like I was saying, that they are going to change um and kind of come up against their own selves in a way.\n",
      "So it’s almost like they have to decompartmentalize and detach themselves from whatever the problem is and then learn to face it and hopefully overtake it but that’s um that’s very difficult yeah, hard thing to do so and you hope for a good outcome in the end.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right\n",
      "Speaker: I agree but I’ve also… I’m coming to realize know to think that maybe it’s not just a therapy, it’s uh it’s a lifestyle change, you know that it is something like, that we will always be doing you know, even throughout life I’m sure he is going um run across obstacles and you know sometimes things are gonna become more challenging throughout life and um you know, I just think it’s… it’s a life style change, and kind of becoming aware of how you perceive obstacle, I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, it sounds like the two of you are really emphasizing the change component\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: mmmh\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "And I’m a little bit new to it.\n",
      "I haven’t, we haven’t been through a whole lot yet, but just of what we have, yeah that’s something that cause I think that when your child is giving a diagnosis that’s it’s gonna be a lifelong diagnosis and the therapy it’s not like you go for a few weeks and it’s done.\n",
      "03: 44 Speaker: and it’s over and it’s cured.\n",
      "I don’t think that, I think it gets better for sure, it becomes manageable and then I think... I’m sure like I said they go through life they might have flare ups or whatever and that they will hopefully learn the skills to be able to...\n",
      "Speaker: Because life is crazy.\n",
      "Speaker: deal with these things.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: You don’t know what s gonna come each day each hour…\n",
      "Speaker: Right\n",
      "Speaker: and they have to be, right, prepared.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, no. I have a drawer full full of scarves, to accessorize.\n",
      "And occasionally when I play with the drawer, something will stick out.\n",
      "That's a no no. I've got to push that or rearrange what's in that drawer so that when I close it, there's nothing sticking out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I know that's a-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Problem for some people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "The drawers are a mess.\n",
      "What room in the house is wonderful is the bathroom.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Bathroom?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Bathroom.\n",
      "It has a laundry basket in there, actually it has two, one for white clothes and one for colored.\n",
      "My husband throws whatever in the right place and I do all it rather regularly.\n",
      "There may be a load that stays in the dryer for a while, that doesn't come up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Would you say that overall there's not that much clutter in the bathroom, or that there is?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Oh, there's no clutter in the bathroom.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No clutter in the bathroom, okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Nope, no... I don't wear makeup, so there's no makeup cluttering the sink area.\n",
      "Anything I need is behind a cupboard and even my towels are in a pile.\n",
      "The wash clothes, they're not just thrown in there.\n",
      "Now, there's one shelf, it's a jumble of medical accessories like hand braces, wrist braces, stuff you put on your head for... [inaudible 00:49:39].\n",
      "I brought it home from the hospital.\n",
      "Cold bags.\n",
      "There's just a jumble of first aid, bandaids, multiple boxes of bandaids.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Anyway, that shelf's a mess, but the door can be closed and nobody knows that they're there.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:50:13] towels.\n",
      "I've got two shelves of towels and wash clothes and they're in straight order, folded neatly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So okay, so sounds like there's not much clutter in the bathroom.\n",
      "Would you say that that's also true of the kitchen or your bedroom?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "The kitchen, I never set anything on the stove.\n",
      "That's one of those safety rules.\n",
      "But the counter sometimes get usurped by stuff.\n",
      "But my husband does the cooking, so he's very quick to inform me that I need to pick this up, put it someplace else.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I often wonder what my house would be like if he were not here.\n",
      "I shudder.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Shudder?\n",

      "Shudder.\n",
      "S-H-U-D-D-E-R.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think it would be more cluttered?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I believe it would be.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Speaking of that, would your ideal home look any different than it does now?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Can you-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Might have a certain minimum of things, and there would always be a place to sit down in the living room.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so there'd be-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "It's a small bedroom.\n",
      "I have a full-sized bed, dresser, [inaudible 00:12:52] and a bookcase [inaudible 00:12:56].\n",
      "I'm in the process of doing laundry, so it doesn't look great, but just working on, I mean my room looks pretty organized.\n",
      "I still have some stuff I need to get out, but overall, my room is very functional.\n",
      "I can walk around and I don't trip over anything [inaudible 00:13:16].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Are all your possessions in your room?\n",
      "Would you keep anything else in other parts of the home?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "My ex has stuff, like hair products and some of my craft products, and then winter clothes, they're in the garage.\n",
      "Then I have, for when I do move out because my goal is by 2021, I have cooking products.\n",
      "Some of the stuff we have in the kitchen already but then the rest, the stuff that's brand new in boxes, they're downstairs in the garage.\n",
      "That's where everyone has their excess stuff that doesn't fit in their room.\n",
      "It's downstairs in the garage, but it's not the whole garage.\n",
      "It's a very small part of the garage and it doesn't even make up a third of the space in the garage.\n",
      "So, it's not a lot.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "When we moved back to Florida, we emptied all our storage and then the stuff we had in different rooms, because every time we moved we had a storage, we did ... we'll say four full-sized U-Haul trips worth of stuff, like collectively.\n",
      "Maybe if we want to say how much of the stuff was mine, maybe one full-sized U-Haul of stuff was mine [inaudible 00:14:50] all the things that I had.\n",
      "Some stuff I probably wish I wouldn't have donated, but I mean now someone else has it, so what can I do?\n",
      "It really conceptualizes how much stuff that you have.\n",
      "I know that's a long roundabout answer to the question, but 90% of the stuff that I had was donated, so now I have like 10% of the stuff that I have now.\n",
      "Now I'm trying to work on getting even less, but then coronavirus happened.\n",
      "COVID-19.\n",
      "That kind of put a hold on stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, it's kind of ruined everyone's plans right now.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So what would you like your home to look like?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "In general?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Does it upset me?\n",
      "Well, I guess the part that I would say upsets me is having difficulties with throwing out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I wouldn't say that it's... I guess it causes stress to do it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So discarding.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah and I mean part of it is knowing that I'm never going to use it but still not wanting to put it in the garbage can.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think it gets in the way of your daily life?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Only to the extent where the garage became the way it was.\n",
      "If the garage doesn't go in the downward direction and my upstairs goes in the upward direction of having less things then I think I'm on the right path.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now we're going to move into two remaining sections about the Covid pandemic.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How has COVID-19 impacted your life?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Well, initially we went out and hoarded food.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Hopefully in a practical way we tried to buy enough food for a period of time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "It means I almost never go to a store so, not that I was doing any kind of buying that was in the hoarding sphere... give me the question again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, that was good.\n",
      "How has covid impacted your life?\n",
      "So you go to the less, of course.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "We go to the store less.\n",
      "So, initially we were going infrequently.\n",
      "We, I guess, learned that things have changed the way people are shopping [inaudible 00:42:07] semi-normal.\n",
      "We're very careful, we don't see people as easily.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has covid affected your difficulties with discarding or has it been more or less the same?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "It's maybe been easier because I have more time to do that.\n",
      "I mean the garage was a real work.\n",
      "We really spent hours getting stuff out of there and there's still stuff, it's not 100% done but it's at a point where it's livable.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, would you say covid has had a positive effect in your attempts to declutter?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah, for practical reasons, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Has covid impacted your overall physical health?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No. No, I mean if anything I've... depending on the weather, when the weather was really good I was exercising more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh. Participant 37:\n",
      "Because I couldn't do my normal exercises where I had a sort of regular routine so I became a little bit more active.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well that's good.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "So I think I'm maybe healthier but [inaudible 00:43:40].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, and has covid affected your overall mental health or well-being?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No, it's just a pain in the neck... I worry more when I'm not in my safe space at home.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "If I go to store I'm a little concerned because I'd rather not.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I think [inaudible 00:23:59] I could do my list on this question because the few collections that I haven't thought about divesting yet are things that I think are just brilliant and I really like them.\n",
      "I guess I have to ask the question, okay do I need to have it?\n",
      "The answer is probably no. Can I afford to have it?\n",
      "The answer is yes.\n",
      "So it's a balance.\n",
      "I haven't reached a point where I don't want to have it and of course I've forgotten the question [crosstalk 00:24:41] me again?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No that was actually good.\n",
      "You mentioned that you ask yourself do I need this or can I afford it.\n",
      "No that's good, that's how you determine if you keep an object or not.\n",
      "So what would you consider trash, what do you discard?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Oh boy.\n",
      "Part of the clutter that we have was recycling and my mother was a very early recycler, which is nice.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "But if you become... I have been fairly obsessive about recycling but recently certain things that I've read and just trying to live life we've decided actually yesterday that we may not be recycling everything that can be recycled or that we can try to recycle.\n",
      "So, what was the question again?\n",
      "I'm getting lost.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "The question was, what do you consider trash or what do you discard?\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:26:15]\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "That's part of the issue and I think that one of the problems that's I have had, which I managed to not do the last two days is if I get a package, because we do buy things by mail a lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "More than we might otherwise-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Because of Covid?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Because of the pandemic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I'll open the envelope and, okay I could reuse the envelope.\n",
      "Well, yeah, sure I can but will I ever?\n",
      "And the answer is probably not [crosstalk 00:26:49].\n",
      "And that's something that was a small epiphany after I got rid of 50 envelopes yesterday.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right so, sometimes you keep things thinking you might use them and then you never end up using them?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah and I think, okay I'll just throw it in this box.\n",
      "Am I going to need this cord again then I'll save that one.\n",
      "I think I'm trying to get away from that.\n",
      "So learning what's trash is a new concept for me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay well that's good.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "It's a little hard because of my background.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay, well at least you're learning, that's what's important.\n",
      "What is the most precious in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Or collection of items.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. And do you… what’s the relationship between patients’ family, friends, loved ones living with them and their degree of insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t know that there is a direct relationship.\n",
      "I think if you have somebody living with you, you have an external person who can provide more insight, but also, or you know kind of help with that, but they can also, if you don’t have high insight, can create defensiveness.\n",
      "We also have people who are kind of passive participants.\n",
      "So, I’m not sure if family members… I definitely have treated family members whose loved ones have no insight, and they’re coming for treatment themselves because they can’t impact their loved one.\n",
      "I’m not sure that I think the loved ones have a real direct impact on insight.\n",
      "Again, I’m not sure what causes insight, but I think it’s more biologically driven.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "How often or how frequently are employees of the state, you know, social workers, police officers, homeowner’s associations, involved in cases of hoarding disorder and people coming in and diagnosing?\n",
      "Interviewee: So, the two different questions.\n",
      "The first one, it depends a little bit on the density.\n",
      "So, in rural areas I think it’s much less common.\n",
      "I think in urban areas it’s quite common, so in San Francisco and in Boston where there are big hoarding task forces, etcetera, the police, the fire department, landlords, tenant’s associations, are very aware of this issue.\n",
      "They have been trained how to diagnose it or at least assess it.\n",
      "In places here where it’s very rural I think people could go for many, many, many years without ever being recognized, so some of it depends a little on… [Name of County] has a hoarding taskforce actually, through the sheriff’s office.\n",
      "But I think it depends a little bit on the impact on society at large, and the more density there is, the higher the knowledge base because the higher the impact.\n",
      "Diagnosing it, I think most of the time people will recognize that there is a problem but will not be able to diagnose it because I don’t think there’s an awareness that it’s an illness.\n",
      "Even, you know, even among medical professionals.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Well alright that is all the questions I have for you.\n",
      "Interviewee: They’re good questions.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What does hoarding disorder look like in your opinion?\n",
      "How is it the same or different from your own behavior?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Repeat that, please.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How is hoarding disorder the same or different from your own behavior?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Like what it looks like.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Well I certainly have in the past bought more than I needed of something so that's one of the things that sticks in my mind.\n",
      "In terms of collecting I guess if I buy more records than I can play or more than one copy of one I think that that's kind of hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I don't know if I have-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So usefulness and just amount of time possible to use all the stuff?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you believe there is a way to tell if someone has hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "There's a good question.\n",
      "Only if you were looking at their shopping cart, maybe.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Although not necessarily, depends on what they're buying but that would be the only way.\n",
      "I guess we were talking about things, books, which I did mention earlier in our call.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Where do you get your information about hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Do you read about it or watch TV shows?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No, I don't watch, I think there is a show about hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, it's on TLC.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No I haven't seen that show.\n",
      "You know, I think if... I guess if I were more afflicted I might not be able to recognize it as easily and if I didn't see it in my mother in recent years I don't know how or where I'd be.\n",
      "I don't know if I've really... you know I hear about neighbors.\n",
      "There was a neighbor that had stacks of newspaper type of thing.\n",
      "So, yeah my mother.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, so you definitely experienced it as a child so you heard about it then.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Well as a child...\n",
      "She wasn't as bad when I was child.\n",
      "I don't if my father had anything to do with it but after he died, and he died when I was 24, so my mother lived alone for 35 [inaudible 00:38:07] years and I think she didn't have anyone to keep her in check.\n",
      "I wasn't bothering her and so she went about her business and she was happy I guess.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What do you think about when you hear the words hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I guess I think a little bit about whatever level of problem I have and I think of my mother.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, okay.\n",
      "Now we're going to move into a section about distress and interference.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, does your behavior and your hoarding upset you?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "So, you see that's the problem.\n",
      "I got rewarded for hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, so yeah you've been like an entrepreneur with all of your items so, I mean...\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "You know it gives me obviously a mixed message.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "But I think, like I said, I don't... and even after I sold that there were some things that I bought.\n",
      "I bought a set of Addams Family trading cards, the TV show from the 60s, because I always watch it and I acquired that, I'm ready to get rid of it, you know, I got it, okay I got it now who cares, right?\n",
      "I guess I was still acquiring between now and 20 years ago but it was limited to a few things I guess that were high on my list of things that I needed to have, needed was in quotes for the transcript.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay, so in this moment in time do you think you have too much stuff even after decluttering a little bit?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So how do you decide when you have too much?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I've been at that point.\n",
      "When will I not have too much I think would be a better question and that is what I'm [inaudible 00:33:04] to sell.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:33:08] how I feel about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I'm not near that, however, is it a finite?\n",
      "Do I see the light at the end of the tunnel?\n",
      "The tunnel is a few miles long.\n",
      "I'm not sure how many years it'll take me or how focused I have to be.\n",
      "I guess I'm fairly efficient and I can try to price things low so people will buy them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "We'll see.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, well that sounds good.\n",
      "Okay, so now we're going to move on to another section and it's about distinguishing hoarding disorder.\n",
      "What do you think are the most important differences between what is considered normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I think that it would have to be what would be considered a reasonable amount of things that you have accumulated so if you look into somebody's garage and they have 10 packages of paper towels I would say okay they're hoarding, pandemic aside.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Nothing to do with the pandemic because I've seen some of my neighbors garages.\n",
      "Right now we have one and a half packages of paper towels and that's only because they were free and I didn't go out of my way to get them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well free is good.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:35:03] I guess if you have more things than you can use by the expiration date then you have a problem.\n",
      "Is that a good enough answer or do you need something more?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, if that's what you believe then... there's no right or wrong answers.\n",
      "Interviewee: Definitely talk to is NAME (1:30:16) and I'm goanna if you haven’t already reached out to NAME (1:30:19) I'm going to send you his email um NAME (1:30:22) runs the housing up in CITY (1:30:25) and NAME (1:20:27) has I think really different insight because he’s reaching patients through the department of housing before they self identify um and so I think that his perspective about you know how does insight and motivation for treatment how does that all play out is is really different from those of us who are kind of in a little bit more um I don’t know uh elitist type of treatment programs right where by the time somebody has called within the greater CITY (1:31:06) community they have found their way to the study of anxiety stress and OCD at the UNIVERSITY (1:31:12) I mean they absolutely already have some insight um now not everybody is ready for what it takes to do this treatment which is probably why I kind of have this unspoken rule that everybody has to do the facilitated self help group first and then they kind of work up to the CBT group and then they work up to the individual therapy um sometimes we break that rule but rarely and I think part of it is we have them do the self help group first to try to figure out ‘are you really ready for this?’ um do you have to have enough kind of motivation to kind of push through uh those tough times\n",
      "P2: Mhm mhm and um I we’ll reach our reach out to you at the end of the interview for contact information that something we intended to do you listed and get names from you and I think you're right he would have a really different perspective on how patients\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "P2: Come to this because you see some other INAUDIBLE (1:32:17)\n",
      "Interviewee: And you know what\n",
      "P2: Mhm\n",
      "Interviewee: NAME (1:32:15) treatment outcomes look better than ours\n",
      "P2: Interesting\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "P2: Yeah and like\n",
      "Interviewee: And you got that carrot you’ve got the carrot of you're going to lose your voucher if you don’t do this\n",
      "P2: Mhm\n",
      "P1: Mhm\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "P2: Okay um so NAME (1:32:38) want to move on to the next section?\n",
      "P1: Yeah I think that the last question I had for you from the insight topic is uh when you're describing a patient with having low insight um what does that mean for you how are you defining insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I think it's basically what I you know what I kind of touched on before is that for low insight it would mean either there is an aspect that they cannot recognize right they’re like looking at the dead birds that they have collected and they’re like ‘they are happy and healthy’ like they do not recognize that they have a problem um that’s obviously an extreme example but but then it think that the other way I would define insight is this variable insight which would be more of that defensiveness the overvalued ideation and then the indifference piece like ‘what’s it to you that my house it cluttered?’ um I think clinicians constantly get in to trouble when we want to get them like to a one on the clutter image rating and they’re totally fine being at a four right like ‘what’s the big deal?’ um so yeah\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Does your mom still try to get rid of stuff for you or does she lay back and let you figure it out now?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah, now it's more so let me figure it out, but she's like, \"What are you doing?\", like asking for progress.\n",
      "Otherwise, no, because I mean we are very close and it's funny because I have so much stuff.\n",
      "She doesn't really have to go shopping for makeup or anything, except for foundation.\n",
      "I mean she likes to buy her own, but I have Fenty and Morphe, all that stuff, whatever stuff.\n",
      "She's like, \"You need to stop buying this, but here.\"\n",
      "It's funny.\n",
      "It's a good relationship but sometimes, like anything, you have your little thing.\n",
      "I'll ask her like, \"Can I have this?\" It's like, \"No, you don't need this.\"\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Now it's more laid-back and just focusing on getting my stuff together.\n",
      "Now with my room, I'm just making sure that everything has a space.\n",
      "That's what I'm trying to do now, and then what I was in the process of doing with, because I have a lot of body care, I was starting to make little goody bags and stuff for people to give away for a gift, for holidays and birthdays and stuff, but you can't do that now because I'm not trying to get sick.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:47:19], yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, that basically concludes the interview.\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "P1: And do you currently uh see patients with hoarding disorder or are you just conducting research?\n",
      "Interviewee: So we’re uh its bazaar in uh in the world of clinical psych especially if your associated with a university in STATE (41:29) it’s the same way for other states as well but but um STATE (41:31) in particular I don’t actually have to be licensed (laughing) so I personally do not see patients but within our group I mention to you we do my lab focuses um on risk and vulnerability across anxiety OC spectrum um so some of the work we do is looking at trans diagnosis risk factors um some of the work we do is focused on OCD and then probably a a third to a half of the work we do is focused on all things hoarding so as result of that um it’s a real conundrum down down here and considering how big of a city CITY (42:18) is um it's always shocking to me I mean I can barely find treatment provides for anxiety and OCD so for forget hoarding like there really isn’t anyone else um who does anything remotely helpful for these patients um and I'm not being a snotty academic uh who is over stating the reality of it it's really like tough down here so as a result of that we um do have on going groups that we provided which I then supervise and so that how I still have a lot of contact with patients um we do the facilitated self help group and then we do group therapy for hoarding patients um and then so that’s more CBT focused group therapy and then we also do individual therapy for hoarding patients\n",
      "P1: Okay\n",
      "P2: Okay\n",
      "Interviewee: Again a long answer sorry guys\n",
      "P2: Yeah no that’s okay um so just to kind of get started thinking of the issues in our interview and we’ve already talked a little about this but just to get us thinking about um about how clinicians think about hoarding right now and how you as a clinicians think about it the first question that we like to ask you related to related to this topic is just to have you talk through what the most important differences between normal saving behavior such as perhaps collecting and hoarding disorder are\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Would I?\n",
      "Yeah, I had to over the years.\n",
      "I had to, I had to, and I had to.\n",
      "Every now and then I think about it.\n",
      "The thought was I have to.\n",
      "Actually, I lived in the country side and had a burn barrel and I just burned stuff, because at the times I went to the dump and I just threw stuff without looking through it.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I've done that.\n",
      "I don't know if it sounds like I'm being kind of proud of it, but it was necessary.\n",
      "I was living in a really small space for six months and another a small space for six months.\n",
      "That's it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What were those emotions like when you had to get rid of something?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "I haven't really faced it yet, but I will.\n",
      "I think it was kind of do this and don't think about it, just compartmentalize, push it over here, put it away and don't think about it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "My final question is would you like to change and why or why not?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Yes, because change is almost [inaudible 00:45:40] for me, and because it would be easier to, I'll say achieve a goal, come to the end of something, complete something.\n",
      "I think that would be easier if I didn't create obstacles.\n",
      "I think I would learn better time use.\n",
      "I think I would be freer from the full time job of hoarding my stuff.\n",
      "All of that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Actually, I missed a question, I didn't realize that.\n",
      "Along with lines of would you like to change and stuff, how did this effect your work life?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "I think I'd be able to make more myself when I was steady working say 8:30 to six every night at one place I worked for 12 months.\n",
      "Yeah, just about a year there.\n",
      "I was able to leave it, leave the home I had, I no longer have that house, and go to work and not think about it.\n",
      "Leave work, go back home.\n",
      "You leave your lifestyle behind and just go do the job the way you're suppose to do it.\n",
      "Towards the end of that job, I would think some things at my home effected me losing that job.\n",
      "Yes, it's not good if it spills over and effects everything.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You're able to maintain that separation between home and work, it's fine, but once they start kind of mixing it, it causes problems for your work?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "That's happened.\n",
      "I worked for [inaudible 00:47:35] that was fine.\n",
      "It was okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Do you have any questions for me?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "When is the next something?\n",
      "Do I do anything next?\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "Interview 008\n",
      "P1: I think the call might have gotten dropped I’m not sure what happened\n",
      "P2: Yeah uh you want to try again?\n",
      "P1: Yeah I’m going to get back I’m going to get her on the line now\n",
      "P2: Okay you think it was my end or your end should I like be doing something different to prevent that from happening again?\n",
      "P1: NAME (0:29) think that something might have happened and the the call got dropped\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah yeah no worries you guys just went super silent (laughing)\n",
      "P1: (laughing) um how much of that-\n",
      "Interviewee: I kept talking though (laughing)\n",
      "P2: Oh good I love that um so so actually right when you handed the podium over to to NAME (0:46) is is where I lost you\n",
      "P1: Okay well that’s perfect I think that NAME (0:53) offered a pretty good overview of what we're doing how the project kinda got started and and what the goals are do you have any questions for us?\n",
      "Interviewee: No that sounds um that sounds really great NAME (1:07) you’re not a medical anthropologist though right?\n",
      "P1: No so I'm actually in the neuroscience department and where my side of things kind of comes in is that I’m going to be working on a project related to uh psychophysiology of hoarding disorder and so studying a couple of different uh ERP waveforms and I think eventually um I’d like to look at some of those wave forms in the context of the the findings that we have with our hoarding participants so if there are differences in um specific subgroups based on um motivations for hoarding that they have or based on degree of insight or construct of insight that more prevalent in certain subgroups and see if that responds to differences in uh different waveforms different ERP waveforms\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh yeah very interesting okay cool yeah yeah so this is great um is so when I you know when I saw it on when NAME (2:08) sent out the the note and then also I think NAME (2:11) and I've been threatening to collaborate for for a couple of years now uh this seem like a great a great you know potential project but you know it also sounds like you guys are pretty far along much further along than um I I have been in in my thinking of such a project and because I I don’t have um I I don’t have uh people power to kind of push this forward so uh everybody’s busy doing other things so yeah I mean I where my thinking was um it I'm very curious about there’s what like five groups that really understand hoarding um maybe that’s even being a little generous NAME NAME NAME and NAME (3:07-3:11) and then me and there’s like the smaller world of IOCDF that knows a little bit more about hoarding but you know certainly doesn’t have an appreciation for it as as kind of as deeply as we do and then beyond that if people have heard of it they watch the show\n",
      "P2: Yeah\n",
      "042\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. The first question is what was your sex assigned at birth?\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What was your sex assigned at birth?\n",

      "Then what is your highest degree or level of education that you completed?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Two and a half years of college.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is your household income?\n",
      "I have ranges so less than $9,999, $10,000 to $19,000, and like so on.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "The lesser.\n",
      "I'm kind of a low-range person.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Which geographic region bet describes where you live in the US?\n",
      "North East, Midwest, South or West?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "South.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "There's just one more question before we get started.\n",
      "Now that you know this study is investigating individuals attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorders.\n",
      "The first question would be what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter and discarding?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Which term?\n",
      "That's a good question.\n",
      "When I first came down, what were they saying?\n",
      "I think they called it collecting.\n",
      "I think that was a polite term, collecting.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Would you like me to use that?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "It's okay if you want to.\n",
      "I'm not offended either way.\n",
      "Whatever's simple.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's just your preference.\n",
      "It's whatever you prefer.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Collecting sounds good to me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That concludes the free listing session of our interview, and the next section is going to be divided into a few different segments and it's going to be more conversation style.\n",
      "This first section is going to be about behavior and treatment seeking.\n",
      "Can you please describe your collecting problems and how long they've been going on?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "Probably the first... I wasn't raised with people who were teaching or showing an example of extremely gathering, collecting, hoarding, but I was married 26 years to someone who did some extreme collecting and hoarding and then I started fighting.\n",
      "Then I did it myself and saw it in my two daughters.\n",
      "What year was it?\n",
      "Probably from 1989 all the way through to about 2010, and then kind of a break, then I still have too much with the papers, the books, and the documents and the envelopes and the office supplies and stuff.\n",
      "I still have that obsession, but I no longer have that home where there's a lot of things.\n",
      "I don't own that home, so that's been helpful.\n",
      "I've learned some things.\n",
      "How to keep going and go for less, but it's like a lifetime battle.\n",
      "That's what it is.\n",
      "Interviewee: Which is horrible (laughing) um so I do always have this question of were are these patients ending up ?\n",
      "Um who’s actually asking about these symptoms?\n",
      "If you don’t ask it the chances are the patients aren’t going to tell you um so once we know that they are hoarding patients obviously that provides a whole different context for how we may be interpreting what other ailments they have um let alone having them attending treatment for for the hoarding specifically um so yeah so that’s what I've been wanting to think about you know being able to survey treatment providers um of different disciplines right I think that’s what going the really important piece um because certainly because the vast majority of your garden variety hoarding patients aren’t going to find their way to to the these very specialized programs um so yeah so that’s where I'm at\n",
      "P2: Mhm yeah so that a really interesting kind of idea so NAME (4:54) and I had started theses interviews with this really core group of experts and as he kind of put it there not like a huge intellectual community right now of people who are really plugged in to you know what it means to have hoarding disorder so we started with those people and then we’ve been talking recently about whether or not we want to get people who are more on the periphery um last time we had talked about this we had um mentioned maybe just doing interviews with clinicians who had just seen a hoarders or two who were not um you know by any means specializing in this and to see how there understanding is different how they go through the process of diagnosing someone with hoarding disorder and compare that with the people who were really at the center of what’s happening and we’ve also talked even about doing interviews with people who encounter people with this disorder through like housing services or um you know task force task forces um surrounding how this just to see again um and you’ll see in our interview we haven’t so far asked about popular perceptions of hoarding disorder mostly because we’ve been interviewing people who are experts in it but it is something we are interested in kind of understanding what is out there and what is the you know the popular understating influencing how people are coming in for treatment and how their understanding what’s happening in their own behavior um yeah sorry I don’t know if you want to add to that NAME (6:21)?\n",
      "P1: Yeah no I just I agree I think that is something definitely thought about in kind of envisioning the scope of our project and I think probably similar you you NAME (6:33) of the main limiting factor for us would be time and and man power to conduct the interviews and all of that\n",
      "P2: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah that that really interesting so the way I mean I think that the uh like I I'm not a qualitative researcher so um so that the techniques and methods for that are pretty fuzzy for me but I have a really under deep appreciation for them um in part because I don’t know if you’ve already spoke with NAME (7:12)?\n",
      "P2: No\n",
      "P1: No we have not\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, I'm just checking in with you to make sure that I got it all right.\n",
      "I've been listening to you and I want to just check with you, to make sure that what I understood is what you understood.\n",
      "She does have hoarding problems, because even though she's got antiques which could be valuable.\n",
      "If she can't enjoy them it's a problem\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That makes total sense to me.\n",
      "Okay let me ask you these demographic questions and then il get your address from you so that I can send you your gift card.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Thank you ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So your gender, I'm going to go ahead and assume is male.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I am Male.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And you said you were 77 years old, earlier in this interview.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yes ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "What is your race or ethnicity?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I'm Caucasian.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "And we have a household income question.\n",
      "And you don't have to be specific on this you can give me a range.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you hear my question are you thinking?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yeah, can you give me an example like, $8000 and above, its just up to me?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "You can just give me an estimate.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Okay I don't know the total income in this household.\n",
      "I'm not very privy to what my son in law and my daughter do but I'm going to guess the total house hold income is $250 000 a year.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And you live in the south east you said in Texas?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yes ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay perfect.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "In Houston, Texas these a [inaudible 00:56:31] quite sure where it is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I've heard the-\n",
      "[END OF RECORDING]\n",
      "037\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "So as you know this study is investigating individual attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question would be, what term do you prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter or difficulties with discarding?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I think when my wife and I and friends talk about it I think we refer to it as being a hoarder.\n",
      "What other terms were there because I know it's been fresh on our minds but not because of your study but because I'm actually decluttering but I think hoarding is probably what we talk about.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so hoarding, problems with hoarding.\n",
      "Some patients prefer difficulties with clutter or clutter problems but if you prefer hoarding we can use that.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "No, hoarding's good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "So the Interviewer is broken up into two sections.\n",
      "So the first section is about making lists and then the second section is more a conversation.\n",
      "So first I'm going to ask you to make some lists.\n",
      "So for this section it's about if I were to ask you to make a grocery list you would say, \"Eggs, bread, cheese,\" something like that.\n",
      "So that's how I would like you to answer these first couple questions.\n",
      "Time is not an issue.\n",
      "You can take as long as you'd like.\n",
      "The idea is to get as good and long a list as possible but it's really important that you keep your answers short and concise, just like a list.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, perfect.\n",
      "So the first prompt is, please list all the things that might contribute to the development of hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Hmm, parental example.\n",
      "Perhaps events in my life where I didn't get something so that I'm, at this point I want it.\n",
      "I'll continue to want that thing more than naturally [inaudible 00:02:13] people.\n",
      "Loving inanimate objects too much and wanting to keep them.\n",
      "The social encouragement of collecting and maybe wanting to have something that somebody else doesn't have.\n",
      "And I don't know is that a good list?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, so far we have parental examples, events in your life where you didn't get something so now you want it, loving inanimate objects and wanting to keep them, social encouragement for collecting and wanting something that someone else doesn't have.\n",
      "Would that be-\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I think that's a pretty good, perhaps part of what's driven me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Okay, that's great and if you think of anything else we can always come back to any of these questions.\n",
      "So the second question is, please list all the reasons that you keep things.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I did mention some.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "If you can think of any [crosstalk 00:03:32] other things.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Well I think also to remind me of an event, perhaps.\n",
      "So, can I give you an example or you just want the list?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you think that that maybe inhibits your desire to discard because it seems like your friends don't care as much about it as maybe others would?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Well, the funny thing, I care about more about what our friends think than NAME does.\n",
      "It used to be, she is a much more social person than I am.\n",
      "I'm really not social at all.\n",
      "The friends that we have are her friends.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I'm just there.\n",
      "We have a friend over right now and I think this friend would like me to be out there visiting with them and I said, \"No, I have an interview.\"\n",
      "Anyway, but I used to, and she would give parties all the, not all the time, but she would give Christmas parties and various kinds of parties and in the summer have people over for barbecue's and stuff, if I would allow it, but I am enough antisocial that I just put my foot down and say, \"Nope.\"\n",
      "This is, again, something that I inherited from living with a very large family on a ranch and my father didn't want people around because people snope and people steal and people are judgemental and I grew up that way and that's the way I feel.\n",
      "I don't want anybody on my property.\n",
      "We used to have people, guys that would come to mow the lawn, and I tell you I would go get into a real fit.\n",
      "I would be as nervous and irritable as can be the day that these guys would show up to mow the lawn.\n",
      "I just couldn't stand it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it sounds like a little bit of fear of people being in your space and that kind of contributed to maybe you being less social.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "I actually have some more questions, more like generally about your hoarding, so how long has this been going on for you?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Oh, I can it back to about the year, nine years old or eight years old.\n",
      "At that time, since my mother was always, for some reason could never find a needle whenever she needed to mend something or to sew up something.\n",
      "She tried to put the needle in the curtains, just stick it in a couple of times, but sometimes I guess she would forget and when she couldn't find her needle, she didn't get nasty or mean because that wasn't the way my mother was, but she would go nuts and I couldn't stand it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, nine years old, you think of, that's pretty early to remember that.\n",
      "Speaker: You don’t want to scare them off.\n",
      "You don’t want to make their anxiety skyrocket when they are like you know oh my god, I’m afraid of sticky things and they are going to make me touch something sticky you know by exposure therapy so I think if you bring that into it find a way to do it gently.\n",
      "Interviewer: Gently for exposure therapy…..\n",
      "What were you thinking?\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah.\n",
      "I mean yes because kids, at least little kids, don’t always wanna do something because they know its best for them, they want to avoid it.\n",
      "They are like oh that sounds bad I don’t want to do that, no.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right, how would you say it in terms of I think ultimately the thing that we end up doing here a lot of times in therapy is doing as you say facing their fears, so I’m kind of curious in terms of how to relay that message to kids about you know finding that sweet spot of not wanting to scare the kids off, but at the same time that is the essence?\n",
      "Speaker: Maybe if you focus on the triumph you know…\n",
      "Interviewer: Focus on triumph.\n",
      "Speaker: Like so if you show the kid that they... that this used to bother them, but then they’ve been challenged and overcame these greater challenges and now look they don’t even think about it.\n",
      "They are just doing it, you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Makes sense.\n",
      "Speaker: and more of a story form rather than ok this is what we do, we are going to do the grossest stuff and you know I mean just show it like show it in a story form.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah there is, I think there is a sweet spot there.\n",
      "Um you know I think using words like you are going to have to be brave, you are going to have to pull your bootstraps up, and you are going to have to be a big kid or you know things like that, that hint at hmmm this may not be that easy, you know.\n",
      "I’m gonna have to do something that is a little bit of work, but they’re not really sure exactly what it is but there is that slight hint of [45:43] ___.\n",
      "But the reward is so great that alright I’m gonna put my big boy pants on or whatever you know.\n",
      "But um yeah I think big words like that, be brave, be strong umm it’s gonna be worth it.\n",
      "Interviewer: So you think…\n",
      "Speaker: It’s gonna be worth it in the end.\n",
      "I think just so you are not tricking them, but you are not putting it all out there either.\n",
      "Interviewer: So definitely not everything out there.\n",
      "We do not want be extremely explicit.\n",
      "Speaker: Because I think for kids that have OCD that if they think they are going to have to either or probably already anxious in their mind about coming here um and then if they are thinking they may face their fears that’s just going the skyrocket the anxiety… and makes those compulsions just really go crazy.\n",
      "Interviewer: How do you think we were discussing earlier potentially of having a kid in the parent video?\n",
      "Would that look different in the parent video in terms of the message that would be given there?\n",
      "Because it seems right now we are talking about the kid video we really want to talks about the benefits of therapy and how you succeed and triumph but hint at the idea that these thing are going to, you are going to have to face your fears.\n",
      "Speaker: It is going to take work\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "It’s going to... for the parent videos?\n",
      "Speaker: Practice… Well it will take some practice on behalf of the kids and I think for the parents you can pretty much put it out there like this is hard.\n",
      "You are going to have to... it’s a challenge.\n",
      "Interviewer: So be more explicit.\n",
      "In that sense be more explicit.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, so it’s like warning you are going to have to roll your sleeves up.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "Then I think we've touched on this before, but if you had to get rid of some of your things, would that upset you?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Somewhat.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Somewhat?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Somewhat, although, the answer flies in the face with why haven't I?\n",
      "You've asked some interesting questions the psychiatrist, psychologist might ask.\n",
      "Why can't I?\n",
      "Why can't I?\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "I've lost the train.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, that's okay.\n",
      "I was asking if you would be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items, and you said somewhat.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "The thing I wouldn't be upset about, maybe not right then, but when I really needed that down the road a piece, then I would be very upset that I had given it away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So if you worked on something down the road, and then you didn't have the thing that you got rid of, that would be upsetting?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "I knew that I had it, but I'd given it away because I didn't need it right then, but when the time came to use it, it wasn't there.\n",
      "I didn't have it.\n",
      "That would make me very upset.\n",
      "So I keep it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So that in case the situation arises, you'll have it?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I think in a second, I'll just ask a few demographic questions, but I think that's all my questions specific to hoarding disorder and clutter problems that I have.\n",
      "Was there anything specifically that you felt that we should know that I didn't ask about?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Nothing jumps out at me.\n",
      "No. This is where I think of them later.\n",
      "You know, the questions on the ...\n",
      "Name as many animals as you can.\n",
      "After I get past anaconda and every kind of snake I can think of, my mind goes blank, and I can't think of anything.\n",
      "That's kind of the way it is here.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "I appreciate, again, all of your time.\n",
      "We just have a few demographic questions, and then I'll just recap what we had talked about real quick, and then I'll let you go.\n",
      "So again, with these demographic questions, the same thing applies.\n",
      "If there are questions that make you uncomfortable or things that you don't want to answer, you can just indicate that you would prefer not to answer that question.\n",
      "We can skip it.\n",
      "So the first one is highest degree of level of school that you've completed.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I have a master's degree in home economics education.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Home economics education.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I decided when I got into it, I didn't like teenagers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Ah, okay.\n",
      "So you started off teaching, but you didn't like teenagers?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I get that.\n",
      "I used to teach middle school myself.\n",
      "The next one is what would your household income qualify as?\n",
      "I can give you some brackets if that would help.\n",
      "P1: And you say exceptions because usually these individuals are living by themselves?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah or they’re just living with their like you know partner their husband or their wife um but in cases where especially down here in CITY (1:45:08) we have a couple of patients I'm thinking about where their multigenerational living in under the same roof um and so the hoarding is impacting more than just their partner and so those were the few exceptions that I had in mind where the patients is the one who seeks treatment where we had then had like a family meeting\n",
      "P2: Mhm just because the other individuals will be directly impacted and will be kind of helping them to live without their stuff or to discard\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "P2: Um you mentioned the case of you know people who are come into hoarding treatment because of social service workers or because of they are going to be evicted um so I guess I'm wondering in comparison with with the people who are brought in by their families um you know you had mentioned earlier that they their outcomes are better because they are going to lose their vouchers so do you think there is a different process for patients who kind of come in to contact with or have to to make these decisions because of forced by an institution or state entity?\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm yeah I think I think when you guys talk to NAME (1:46:29) I think that will be really interesting for you\n",
      "P2: Mhm you think that a pretty different process for them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yes because\n",
      "P2: Because they don’t have any control at that point\n",
      "Interviewee: I mean if you think about our treatment our treatment is not rocket science and its also not like in some ways it’s not mount Everest it's like okay you're going to discard your stuff you're going to practice discarding your stuff were going to create a hierarchy that you use and we’re going to work our way all the way up and them maybe we will throw in some you know cognitive remediation and maybe we’ll throw in some like cognitive therapy to target those beliefs but its not that its like that challenging you ask anyone who works with hoarding patients what its challenging I would be shocked if not on one of their top ten list is getting them to do their homework and telling them to do it um so I think that that’s the part where the external forces is just so instrumental because it just helps in um you know but I say that but there’s some days like they still NAME (1:47:45)’s group has tried a token economy an that you know works just about as well as everything else we do ie not that impressively um and so I do think there’s something about it being very kind of hard concrete external reinforce-er I don’t know I’ll be curious about what you guys say after you talk to NAME (1:48:11)\n",
      "P2: Yeah I think that that will be an interesting interview for us um and we’ll get in contact with him I think I'm not sure if I can find him I just looked him up and I didn’t email address so\n",
      "Interviewee: I’ll I’ll send it to you\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (1:48:24) later\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah I’ll send it to you\n",
      "P2: Yeah I think that’s a really interesting too um so if you just to kind of return to the questions we skipped sorry about that NAME (1:27:33) kind jumping all over the place um so if you were to think about your conversations with patients um how would you how do you try to help a patient gain insight or how do you try to help patients recognize things about this concept of insight that might be able to recognize in treatment what do you say to um to get them there?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well one of the things that I think about a lot to capitalize on where they’re at so there was something well let me backup I take a very MI approach to this so that’s probably the simplest way to answer that so you you kind of roll with the resistance but you try to them really flesh out um their potential reasons for change the potential barriers to change and and the ultimate hope would be you are going to kind of increase this readiness for change kind of like mental preparedness for change um but I I really keep that in mind throughout treatment with hoarding patients because there are going to be weeks where whatever it is that you are sorting is going to be sorting is going to um it it's just going to be tougher and so maybe you're just going to have more of a challenge that week than than others so just kind of rolling with that resistance and helping the patient can navigate that um an making it okay that you understand um you know similar to someone one with subs abuse there’s a reason why they are using there’s a reason why our patients are saving their stuff and those reasons aren’t bad\n",
      "P2: Mhm\n",
      "Interviewee: The behavior the result is not helpful but the reason behind right it we shouldn’t necessarily judge\n",
      "P2: Ham interesting and just to kind of carry that a step further um one thing that we heard from some other clinician is that um by the time the patients come to them they already they kind of by definition already have some insight as to what’s going on so if you can just think through in your experience what that process before patients you know are necessarily self identifying as hoarders or are coming in for studies or treatment what that process of gaining insight on their own has looked like for your patients\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah you know the person who INAUDIBLE (1:30:12)\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (1:30:13)\n",
      "Speaker1: Yeah that’s like you know… like it’s a lifestyle change.\n",
      "It’s how I view it.\n",
      "It’s just an everyday, every you know… and it does get better, it does get better, buts it never I don’t feel like it’s ever been perfect like oh we’re cured know lets be done, we’re done, we do not have to do this anymore.\n",
      "I feel like we still do it.\n",
      "Interviewer: It’s ongoing.\n",
      "Speaker: It’s ongoing… to a lesser degree hopefully.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok um is there anything talking about CBT and videos for CBT that I’ve missed or you feel like it’s important to mention that we haven’t gone over already?\n",
      "Speaker: I can’t think of anything.\n",
      "I feel like we covered…\n",
      "More than I ever expected…\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah I feel like we covered from my experience so far yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok is there anything that came up with you that you want to mention at all?\n",
      "Note taker: There was one part in the beginning where both of you were talking about how don’t be afraid to ask for help um when it comes to kind of like warning others about how hard CBT could be and I just wrote what do you mean by help like in terms of like babysitting in terms of like…\n",
      "Speaker: I think in any way you can get support for your family um because when you have a child that is going through something like this the attention that they need is kind of all-consuming, and um you can’t… if you have other children it does become more difficult to kind of evenly distribute your attention to them so by having any help whatsoever from family or friends while you are kind of going through just be it to… umm maybe just help take some load off by helping at home, you know fixing a dinner or taking a couple of the children off to playdates, or um even just being there as someone to bounce ideas off of.\n",
      "I think just that overall physical and emotional support.\n",
      "Speaker: Or to even reinforce the things that you are trying to accomplish like you know if they see their grandmother let them in on it, and say this is what we are dealing with now and if you could react this way you know and deal with this type of manner you know reinforce how you what you are taught in therapy, how to a deal with a situation and you that is also um helpful.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah definitely.\n",
      "Note taker: That was all\n",
      "Interviewer: That was all?\n",
      "Note taker: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: , my name is …So I’m just going to ask you a series of questions similar to what and you all talked about during the consent portion.\n",
      "So I want to thank you for participating and meeting with me today.\n",
      "As we said this research is about finding and just creating a few short educational videos that basically describe what we do here with CBT and cognitive behavior therapy and what that really is and getting perspectives from parents as well as children as to what they think CBT is and what their experiences have been here as well.\n",
      "And so instead of cognitive behavior therapy I might say CBT just because it’s a lot to say cognitive behavior therapy a bunch of times.\n",
      "So if you hear me saying CBT, that’s what I’m saying.\n",
      "Ok, sounds good?\n",
      "Alright, so to start please tell me what comes to mind when you think about CBT?\n",
      "Speaker: Success.\n",
      "I’ve seen great changes in my son the past.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Could you elaborate?\n",
      "What success have you seen from him?\n",
      "Speaker: I’ve seen him change his focus instead of getting stuck on certain things an certain elements hew moves on much quicker than he ever moved on before.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "Could you tell me what you know about CBT?\n",
      "In your own words how would you explain to someone what CBT is?\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know how to explain it.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s completely fine if you feel that you can’t explain it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Well were there, in terms of this experience um have there, I know you are on different levels in terms of how long your child has been on CBT, but has there been anything confusing or anything that been like you weren’t expecting?\n",
      "Speaker: I expected to learn a lot of new things, you know expected, I kind of expected the unexpected, I guess.\n",
      "Um maybe because I just wasn’t familiar with it and just kind of did the basic in looking into it, but no I guess I really can’t say anything that was perfectly unexpected not yet, we still little ways to go.\n",
      "Speaker: Nothing so unexpected, I just know there is a lot frustrating I feel sometimes um that I, I don’t, I’m sure other parents feel the same way, I don’t know but… it it is wearing.\n",
      "It can wear on you, you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: Are those things, um I’m sorry.\n",
      "Speaker: No, no it’s ok\n",
      "Interviewer: I was gonna say are those um for future parents coming in, bringing in their children for CBT like what you would want say to do them about this experience like what to expect?...\n",
      "Like what things do you, alternatively, what things do you wish ere explicitly told?\n",
      "Speaker: Maybe that um you know it’s not like a switch just gets flipped and everything is ok.\n",
      "Interviewer: more of a process.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah it’s a process.\n",
      "Speaker: It’s it’s the beginning, like what you were saying earlier, of a process that is going to transcend throughout their lives.\n",
      "Um that there is a lot more that I would have to I think have to be involved with then I initially realized as a parent, it’s really for us too.\n",
      "So like I’m learning and having to take notes and having to do these exercised at home.\n",
      "You know after we leave here each day and probably will have to continue I don’t even know how long, So I really did not know that part was coming then again I wasn’t sure.\n",
      "So yeah I think letting parents know that you will have to be daily involved in the sessions, but also the work at home.\n",
      "You know, kind of be prepared to be present physically, mentally, and emotionally throughout the whole process more so than maybe you initially might think.\n",
      "Speaker: That’s true, I agree with that very much yeah.\n",
      "I didn’t expect there to be some much involvement either on my end.\n",
      "I knew there would be, but you know you really have to train yourself.\n",
      "Oh here’s a moment, here’s uhh you know, instead you have basically fallen into these habits that you have to break and that you’ve been doing for so long and you got form these new habits you know recognize when an opportunity is arising and sometimes you just you know life gets in the way, and you are busy, and you have other children, other things going on and it’s hard to sometimes to bring all that together.\n",
      "Speaker: I think, I think with having other children that’s one of the biggest challenges, yeah for me too.\n",
      "Your child has sibling you just can’t 24/7 hone in on that one child unfortunately it’s just not realistic whether they need it or not you can’t, you’re a mother you have to care for all you know.\n",
      "That’s tough.\n",
      "Speaker: it’s tough.\n",
      "It’s really hard\n",
      "Speaker: It is….\n",
      "So I think maybe letting people know that… don’t be afraid to ask for or arrange for help ahead of time maybe before going through the program because you know it can be kind of intense while you are in it and if you have other children you may need friends or grandparents or other family whoever might be able to just be around, just to add that extra help to a whole family unit, I certainly think it will be very beneficial.\n",
      "Speaker: yeah that’s a good idea.\n",
      "Like bringing the family into it like more so that the siblings can ok this, kind of help get involve.\n",
      "Speaker: Sure, yeah\n",
      "Speaker: You know so that it, I don’t know.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "We've removed the clutter from the garage.\n",
      "I have a room upstairs which is cluttered in a lot of containers and I need to go through them.\n",
      "Am I too [inaudible 00:13:00] in answering the questions?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, no worries.\n",
      "If I feel like we're going off on a tangent I'll interrupt you but no that was great.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, you're decluttering your garage right now.\n",
      "Do you believe that your behavior is a problem or has it gotten better over time?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Well I think the fact that I no longer buy like I had means I'm going in the right direction.\n",
      "I have other friends who continue to buy, and my brother.\n",
      "When I hear what they're doing in my mind I say, \"no, you're going the wrong way.\"\n",
      "So, in my mind they're going the wrong way.\n",
      "I could dump everything and my life would be fine but I'm still...maybe I'm devoting my cluttering energies towards trying to get a return even it's small because I know people will buy some of these things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I could give you an example if you want but I'm going to let you decide whether you want to find out how well I'm doing or [inaudible 00:14:13].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, please, you could share.\n",
      "An example would be great.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay, so in the middle 70s I became a fan of the band Kiss, are you old enough to know Kiss?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes, I do know who they are.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Well they're famous enough that even a college student would know.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Well, in 1976 they were a real [inaudible 00:14:41] band and they weren't mega stars yet but I saw them and they were amusing, I like the music, so I bought a Kiss garbage can, I bought about five Kiss belt buckles.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "So, you may say, \"How many belt buckles does a person need?\" And the answer is one, okay?\n",
      "But I had more than one and I think I sold one years ago because I haven't seen it but a few weeks ago I found three or four others and one of them I didn't get rid of but the other three I was able to sell for over $600.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "So I got rewarded for my behavior.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It just maybe took awhile but that's okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "It what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It just maybe took awhile but it worked.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Well in a sense it was good that I let them sit in a box for 40 years.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "The person who bought them said that they could have gone for more money so perhaps the pandemic has changed the way people are spending their money.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For sure.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I was happy with the money I got.\n",
      "I hadn't been following the market if there is such a thing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right. Okay. Gotcha.\n",
      "So now I'm going to read another one.\n",
      "John Doe has boxes, books and bags that he keeps in case he needs to use them in the future.\n",
      "These boxes, bags and books occupy most of his room except for the kitchen and his bedroom.\n",
      "Before taking a shower he must remove some of these items from his bathtub.\n",
      "Sometimes it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 10 to 20 minutes looking for them until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens he is usually late to getting to where he needs to be.\n",
      "Do you think this person has hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And so far, how does-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "It's so bad that either he has a very small house and can't come up with something creative.\n",
      "I have often thought that if push came to shove and I ran out of room to store things in that I thought I wanted, I would figure out some way to make a net.\n",
      "I would either buy a net of some kind or make a net and hang it from the ceiling.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "He's either not very creative about where to store his boxes so that he has to store them in his bathroom, but in any case I would think that it's hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "How would you say that this so far compares to your hoarding?\n",
      "Do you think it's kind of similar?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "No. I haven't stooped so low so to speak to store things where I can't take a shower.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "If I lived by myself maybe that would be something different, but I have a partner to think of and she's got it, she takes a shower more often than I do and I certainly couldn't put things in the shower.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "It sounds like you aren't as severe as putting things in maybe places that really don't make sense because you can still use your areas, but it sounds like you experience the same thing with the stacks of boxes as what is being described here?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah you know we intentionally made this list to not be one of the diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder because it's not a quiz you know so I guess what were what we are trying to get at with this question is exactly that like what do you how would you really know if you knew about hoarding disorder what would it look like so um it might be appropriate to include it on the list even though it's technically not a diagnostic criteria and you know we have\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah INAUDIBLE (32:22)\n",
      "P2: Anecdotally We’ve heard that from other providers as well\n",
      "P1: Mhm\n",
      "P2: Those exact features\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah and you know the other piece I would also say is that um these patients like in some ways they also have a little more of a feeling like somebody with a personality disorder and I don’t I don’t mean that in like a negative kind of stigma way that people sometimes take that what I mean is there is just to something about its really unique about these patients is that whole issue of wanting and maintaining control um and and that’s where you know I joke we do we run groups down here and more as a service to the community because there’s nobody else who provides treatment for hoarding in CITY (33:15) and um and just because I’m I don’t have that much personnel down here and so I I've trained some of our senior undergraduate students to help kind of facilitate these groups and hoarding patients love them and I always joke about the fact that they love them more than they love talking to me talking to be the quote on quote hoarding expert um and theses this aspect where they feel like their contributing to that students educations and that then directly feeds back to their sense of their own value and then they are more invested in that versus\n",
      "P2: That’s interesting input\n",
      "Interviewee: If you know we have some of and in fact I think the undergrads do better that some of my graduate students especially the graduate students who come from having done like a social anxiety group or even like a OCD group where you know its much more kind of didactic where it's like ‘well today were going to be doing our exposure and this is how exposures work now let’s design your exposure and let’s go do it’ and the patients like ‘okay’ (laughing) you know?\n",
      "Um and with hoarding it's more like you know if they use that style you just get a bunch of patients that are just like sticking their feet in the mud and like ‘yeah I don’t know about this’ but then if you make it feel like it's part of their idea or you know make them feel like they were really part of contributing to these patients training um then they do better with that also not an easy list response I'm sorry\n",
      "P2: (laughing) No its okay its very interesting\n",
      "Interviewee: I'm bad at listing (laughing)\n",
      "P2: Go ahead let's just get through your last prompt and then I'm really looking forward to the rest of the interview because I have so many questions but don’t want to derail you\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "No, several years ago I stopped watching television.\n",
      "Because I didn't like what I was seeing.\n",
      "I still try to keep up with the news to a degree.\n",
      "In terms of reading otherwise, newspapers and that's what I'm constantly doing [inaudible 00:44:21] I live in a society that seems like it's going more and more insane I don't quite understand what's happening.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Do you feel like it's been easier to stay at home with your daughter and son in law in that house?\n",
      "Or do you fel like the have been going to work and it's normal with them, the people that you live with?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Well my daughter is pretty much working, she's an engineer.\n",
      "She has to go to Houston to look over some of her bridges.\n",
      "Those are the new bridges she's designed and in the project daily report.\n",
      "Late before I knew doing bridges, like all the freeway inter changes, all the passes stuff like that.\n",
      "So she's been working from home[crosstalk 00:45:07].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you had any conflict with her?\n",
      "Or the people that you have been home with?\n",
      "I know sometimes when people are all couped up together it gets difficult to stay in the same space.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Oh, there's lot of space.\n",
      "My son in law, he's a developer, he goes out and looks at properties and he does work at home.\n",
      "If he has left for his office with a computer, my daughter has an upstairs office with a computer.\n",
      "We have really good internet access.\n",
      "We have a full gigabyte connection with AT&T.\n",
      "We have a strong internet, my grandsons they have video rooms with own bedrooms so there's plenty of stuff to do and stay out of each others' ear.\n",
      "We haven't had a problem, not that I'm aware of.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "We have fortunate circumstances.\n",
      "Could be quite a bit different if it weren't that way.\n",
      "My daughter often has stuff delivered and stuff she need to go shopping brought to the car.\n",
      "Services like that have been available.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "My son in law he likes to bu stuff on Amazon anyway[inaudible 00:46:15].\n",
      "The only problem is my daughter has inherited my fat genes and she's ballooned up enough now, I don't know she'll ever go back to work.\n",
      "She's gotten abusive now but I can't really [inaudible 00:46:32] be taParticipant 036 seriously.\n",
      "That's going to be a problem for her professionally.\n",
      "That's going to be more of her problem [inaudible 00:46:39].\n",
      "It bothers me because , I got some responsibility for that [account 00:46:43].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "I understand it's very difficult during all this to stay healthy and active.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:46:49]\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "No, it's fine.\n",
      "It was the same boyfriend.\n",
      "I think we were close to breaking up and I was trying to get him to go to therapy, but he was like, \"Oh, well that's good for you but I don't trust therapists.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh. Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So then yes, a negative impact then.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So besides family and romantic relationships, have your clutter problems ever affected your work or school, I guess, since you said that you went to college and you're a nursing student now, right?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So I wasn't able to focus because it was just too much stuff going on in my room to focus.\n",
      "I mean I started submitting work late, and that's not good.\n",
      "Yeah, that wasn't good.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it caused a lot of distractions for you and your schoolwork and stuff.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I think something, just how I was storing stuff, it was just a mess, but things are a whole lot better.\n",
      "I'm grateful for the move to Florida, so yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It sounds like this move was good for you and you've figured out-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah, it was good for everybody.\n",
      "My grandpa's happy, my mom is happy, my brother is happy.\n",
      "My mom got promoted, so we moved back to Florida with her.\n",
      "I was like, \"Yeah,\" because Maryland wasn't going to be a forever home.\n",
      "It was just to see how it was and I came back here, and we've been doing it pretty good ever since, and right before all of this craziness happened too, so it was the right timing.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I can't imagine moving right now.\n",
      "That'd be not good.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Mm-mmm (negative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So the last question I have would be, would you be upset if you had to get rid of some of your items?\n",
      "I know you're actively trying to sort some out, but let's say it wasn't you actively trying to get rid of [inaudible 00:45:13] someone else forcing you.\n",
      "Would that really upset you?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean I already had to do that.\n",
      "It did upset me because it's not my house, but what can I do about it?\n",
      "So I'm like, \"Okay.\"\n",
      "You might as well just get over it and keep it going.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I mean, go ahead.\n",
      "P1: So it seems like its crux of thing to which they are applying that distorted value judgment to and there’s also an aspect that you mentioned of that there is a cultural or societal norm for what things have value and I'm curious to whether that monetary value or emotional values or atheistic values which of these are we talking about?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um I think that I think it I think it depends I don’t think we have really good answered for that yet um if you go with that example of the woman I just talked about where she had the five storage units so she the part that I didn’t mention was she lived in a house boat actually okay so she lives in a very small space basically the size of a camper um and the stuff that’s in the storage facilities is is all of her parents old belonging um and she’s you know also part of the context here is she’s like I think sixty-six or something like that um and her parents died like about twenty years ago and and so in those twenty years she has kept paying for those five storage units she has gotten divorced she has loss a home she has been displaced because of hurricanes like all these things have happened to her she has hung on to those storage units um she also really part of the reason she’s on the boat is she’s financially super super strapped she’s on medicaid um and a lot of people including her adult children have suggested she should go through those storage units because there may be something of value in there that she could actually sell to try to get her off of the boat and into um a you know a kind of normal apartment or home um and so that would be an example of where she probably has some valuable stuff right so I think another element that you have to factor in is how much do you hang on to stuff even if it is of value despite reasons that would indicate that you should see or discard or do something with them does that make sense?\n",
      "P2: Yeah totally that’s a lot that a lot for that criteria that a lot of work INAUDIBLE (1:09:41) diagnostic work behind that criteria you know it leaves a lot\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "P2: On the shoulders of the clinician\n",
      "Interviewee: Absolutely which is another thing that brings me back to why I am so fascinated to think about your average physician right who who maybe only ever seen advertisements for buried alive what are they going to do with these criteria like how are they determining this?\n",
      "They’re not right?\n",
      "An anyway I digress\n",
      "P2: And it is very interesting again kind of to move in the interview to talking about the interview process just from my perspective just from listening to these interviews the very different ideas that people have about there diagnostic criteria I mean they go from thinking there’s a lot of nuance to very little nuance just in the few interviews we’ve done so far we’ve done about eight so far and we have really seen a range I don’t know if you agree with that NAME (1:10:37) but it is very surprising to me the different ways clinicians talk about this criteria\n",
      "Interviewee: I wonder if a lot of that is going to come down to MDs\n",
      "P2: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewee: Versus\n",
      "Interviewer: So, you feel like, we psychiatry, medicine is not in a place where we can directly treat insight, lack of insight.\n",
      "Interviewee: No, I think we can chip away at it, but I don’t think we can directly treat it.\n",
      "And I don’t actually think we’ve been very successful in schizophrenia or anorexia either, which are two other disorders which have a significant insight component.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: We try with anorexia to kind of pound insight into folks, but I don’t think it’s successful.\n",
      "I think people recover from anorexia and at some point, they gain insight, but I don’t think psychiatry really impacts them in that context other than treating their symptoms such that they can come to it.\n",
      "Interviewer: Can you speculate as to what goes into that shift to insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: For anorexia?\n",
      "Interviewer: For anorexia, what it would look like in [indistinguishable 33:17]\n",
      "Interviewee: I wish.\n",
      "I have patients I wish I could get to that shift.\n",
      "I don’t really have a good sense, unfortunately.\n",
      "I think motivational interviewing can help kind of identifying places where symptoms or problems are causing distress that the patient themselves identifies.\n",
      "I actually think, for a lot of patients, insight varies, it’s not static.\n",
      "Insight can be greater or worse at certain times or times of life or whatever.\n",
      "But I don’t think we can really treat insight per se, not in most people.\n",
      "That’s not to say we shouldn’t try.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And have you seen that variance in insight in individuals with hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm.\n",
      "Interviewer: And it’s just over days, over time, what kind of period have you seen?\n",
      "What have you seen?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think there’s two kinds of trajectories, one is over time with treatment, somebody who engages in treatment, their insight can shift for the better.\n",
      "I also think that people have moments of insight, often with an… so when somebody comes over and makes a comment about their house.\n",
      "Where, you know, they’re habituated to the situation and something kind of brings it to their awareness from an external perspective.\n",
      "That can cause flashes of insight.\n",
      "I think defensiveness, which you talked about before, can kind of create lower insight as kind of a protection at some level.\n",
      "So, if you push too hard you can have people retreat into kind of a decreased state of insight.\n",
      "And so temporally you can see longitudinal changes, usually with treatment, but sometimes just with disease progression, and then you can see these kind of momentary shifts, which sometimes can also lead to temporal changes, right?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewee: Kind of those breakthrough moments people talk about one way or the other.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Kind of the last set of questions I wanted to ask you were: what role do a patient’s family and friends play in arriving at a diagnosis of hoarding disorder?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well if you can get collateral information it’s always very useful because patients can over and under report their symptoms, typically under report but also over report.\n",
      "An assessment of impairment and distress, an assessment of insight.\n",
      "It’s hard to get that collateral often, but when you have it it’s useful.\n",
      "Interviewer: What relatives do you find are most often involved in that process?\n",
      "Interviewee: It’s not necessarily relatives, it’s somebody living with the person, so living partners usually.\n",
      "Children sometimes, sometimes neighbors actually.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha. Okay. I'm going to read one more.\n",
      "John Doe has several antiques that he keeps because he likes them and knows they are valuable.\n",
      "He goes out once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "He is worried that he might get rid of an antique item that is worth a lot of money.\n",
      "Antiques occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering his bathroom he must remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often it is difficult for Mr. Doe to find his car keys and wallet so he will spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them until he eventually finds them or forgets what he was looking for.\n",
      "He is almost always late in getting to where he needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\n",
      "Do you think that this person has hoarding?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "It doesn't make any difference really whether you buy things and hoard them or whether you collect free things.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "If you collect things that you don't use even though you think they are of value, it's hoarding as far as I'm concerned.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "Collecting a lot of things, especially things that you value whether or not it has some, maybe to some it has value, to others it doesn't but if you place a value on it and you have a lot of those items, then that's-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If you were to ask me to give a definition of hoarding part of that would be that it is items that have, may or may not have value but you, yourself, don't use them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I think that is absolutely essential to a definition of hoarding.\n",
      "It's not something that you need or use, but mainly it's the using part of it, the definition that's the key.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So having a lot of items-\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "That's what makes the whole thing absolutely ridiculous.\n",
      "That's what differentiates us people, us hoarders from other people in that we have all these items but we don't use them.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "So it's like even though those things could be of value to someone, you have so many items that it's at the point where things don't even get used?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "That's a great definition.\n",
      "Thank you for that.\n",
      "This last part actually asks about COVID and how it's impacted your life.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Can I go back just a little bit.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, sure.\n",
      "No worries.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I really think that you should revise your story.\n",
      "I think having the business about him looking for his keys that he either can't and usually he can't find them right away.\n",
      "I really think that's immaterial.\n",
      "I think that's a distraction.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah. Talk about redoing equipment and having equipment handy, I went out and purchased five seam rippers.\n",
      "For some unknown reason, they disappear and then they reappear.\n",
      "But I needed it.\n",
      "I didn't open them all right away, but eventually I did.\n",
      "I think I still have one that I haven't opened.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So it sounds like one of the problems is that things kind of disappear now and again.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's very frustrating.\n",
      "I will use something and I'll stand right there, I'll set down that implement that I'd be using, and then I do something else right there.\n",
      "And then I go to use that again and it's rolled away or it's lost or it's under something.\n",
      "It's like it disappears by magic.\n",
      "And then I look around for it, sure enough, it's close by.\n",
      "I don't know whether we, yes we did, my way of remedying.\n",
      "We haven't gotten to that one yet.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Way of remedying.\n",
      "You can go ahead and touch on it right now.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "There's a gentlemen who did carpentry.\n",
      "And when he laid down a tool, it was right there.\n",
      "Everything was in a row, decently in an order.\n",
      "And he knew exactly where it is, was.\n",
      "He could pick it up and use it and then set it down right there.\n",
      "And I have been trying to do that without much success, but that's a goal that I have.\n",
      "And someday it will come to fruition.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Laying tools down in a systematic way, it sounds like.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah, very systematic.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever sought treatment for a hoarding disorder or clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I did, actually.\n",
      "I looked around for a psychiatrist or a psychologist or people that treat.\n",
      "I checked on the web.\n",
      "And there are people who treat various mental things, but nobody here in Charlottesville seemed to treat hoarding or list hoarding as a thing that needed to be addressed.\n",
      "There was one person, but he holds two offices, or the firm has two offices, 30 miles away.\n",
      "And he stays in the office 30 miles away.\n",
      "My neurologist seems to think I should not be driving, and this is as of three or four years ago.\n",
      "And I understand it, but I don't have the freedom to pick up and go, which irritates the [inaudible 00:15:46] out of me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I can imagine.\n",
      "It sounds like you were interested in getting help from either a psychiatrist or a psychologist but that they were too far away.\n",
      "And you said that your neurologist doesn't recommend you driving.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. So we’ve touched on this a little bit, the difficulty discarding due to a perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them.\n",
      "How do you go about determining how much distress is normal or abnormal?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well I think that distress in discarding in general is abnormal, right, in that we may feel a little twinge of sorrow when we get rid of something that has sentimental value, but we’ve decided it’s time to go.\n",
      "But that’s not really distress, that’s sorrow, right?\n",
      "Distress is a feeling of real discomfort because… well in this case because you might need it, because you’re worried that if you let it go you’ll miss that information or you’ll miss that object.\n",
      "Its… I would actually characterize it differently.\n",
      "You know, when I’m getting rid of my kids’ T-shirts from when they were two I feel a little bit of sorrow about that and I feel sentimental, but I don’t feel distress.\n",
      "I don’t feel like I’m going to need those again; I can’t get rid of them because I’ll never remember my child again.\n",
      "Its really more of a, kind of a sentimental sorrow.\n",
      "And so, I think the intention of that term in the DSM-5 is really about, its causing problems.\n",
      "And in this case its problems related to a physical sensation or an emotional sensation, anxiety, etcetera.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "And is it sometimes difficult to assess the level of distress that hoarders have?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah, there’s no real objective way to assess an internal feeling, right?\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah.\n",
      "What about if a patient is denying having a problem?\n",
      "Interviewee: So that’s true for all disorders that have variable insight.\n",
      "I think you have to assess some external measures of distress and impairment.\n",
      "If they won’t let someone into their home, if they feel socially isolated, if they can’t bathe or can’t do very basic activities of daily living, then even if they deny impairment we would intuit impairment.\n",
      "But for example, the man who was an information collector with all of the technology, he came to our study because he recognized that there was a problem.\n",
      "And so his level of distress did not meet active criteria, and he was one I actually sent a case around to multiple experts to kind of help determine, and they all agreed he was kind of on the borderline.\n",
      "But he had some inkling that there was something there.\n",
      "And so we can create Likert scales to determine the amount of distress, but there is really no… it’s an internal feeling.\n",
      "It’s kind of along the lines of “how much pain are you having,” right?\n",
      "Impairment is a little easier to quantify because you can assess activities of daily living and functionality.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah. So I started hoarding needles.\n",
      "Every time, eventually we'd run out of needles so the next time we went to the store and we had to drive 100 miles to go to a store, she'd buy a pack of needles.\n",
      "Well, guess who got those pack of needles?\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "I went into the grocery packs and I took those kinds of things, needles and scissors and thread and I found an old dresser kind of like a...\n",
      "Actually what it was, was an old record cabinet where people used to keep the 78's, records.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I turned that into my drawer, my dresser and no one, I got my mother to agree and tell my sisters that they were to never to go into my drawer.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:40:32]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "That's when you started saving all that stuff.\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "That's pretty crazy.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, that's interesting too, what you were saying earlier about telling between clutter and actual hoarding, seems like you had some good insight to being that old and noticing you were doing that.\n",
      "When you think about it now, what are some important differences between normal saving behavior such as collecting and hoarding, do you think?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Normal saving behavior and hoarding?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "What's the difference?\n",
      "You were saying there's a clutter problem and then there's hoarding or people collect and then there's hoarding.\n",
      "What differentiates that in your mind?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Well, I make a difference between the two in that hoarding is something that you save the same kind of thing or even the same thing.\n",
      "It's something in multiples.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Whereas, boxes for instance, and I always go back to boxes because, of course, there is kind of an anteroom before you get into the basement in this house and that room is nearly ceiling to floor in boxes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "You can still get down the stairs and go into the part of the basement where the washing machine is and the water heater and the fuel tank and so forth, but most of it is taken up by bookcases, a big bookcase as well as just stacks of boxes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "It's the hoarding of something that's pretty much the same, whereas clutter can be a number of things piled in a pile or thrown in a corner or thrown in a box, shoved under your bed, that's clutter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "The difference is besides just having a pile of something, it's a lot more things in a lot more places, right?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever had any-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I cleaned up my parents' house when they died.\n",
      "Mother moved into a assisted living.\n",
      "And cleaning up that business was a mess, and they do not want to go through the same thing that I had to go through.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "They don't want to have to clean or go through that.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And like I say, I'm 79, so I'm not old.\n",
      "Old is 80.\n",
      "I'm getting there.\n",
      "I'm going to have to reappraise that whole business.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you ever had any conflicts with people close to you about hoarding disorder or clutter problems?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, my husband just generally around the house.\n",
      "I also have a problem when there isn't a way.\n",
      "Sometimes I will start to put it in the nearest [inaudible 00:44:53] that's available.\n",
      "I don't get it where it's supposed to be.\n",
      "Like just this morning I had raisins for my Cheerios, and I'd gotten the package down, got the raisins.\n",
      "And instead of putting it away where it was supposed to, I started to put it where it was because I got the raisins for when I make oatmeal.\n",
      "Wanted to put it right handy in a little container.\n",
      "I wanted to put it up with the salt and the oatmeal, and my husband said [inaudible 00:45:33] and he harrumphed and \" [Participant 040 00:22:36]?\" And I looked at what I had and what I was doing and promptly put it where it was supposed to be.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like there's some conflict with your husband wanting things in a specific place.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Like I say, he's on the spectrum.\n",
      "OCD, very precise, very smart.\n",
      "PART 2 OF 4 ENDS [00:46:04]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Very smart.\n",
      "But it's not OCD, it's COD.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "If that makes sense.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So you mentioned that there are, especially you mentioned in the back room and in your sewing room, there's a lot of stacks and there's these aisles that you can walk through.\n",
      "You also mentioned that there's some stuff in your living room.\n",
      "Would you say that that describes your house as a whole, or are there certain areas that have less stuff than others?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Certain areas have less stuff.\n",
      "I have a standard.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Nothing will peek out of a closet or of a drawer.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "If you close the drawer, you shouldn't be able to tell what's in there.\n",
      "The other thing I have the standard is, is it safe?\n",
      "Is someone going to slip on it?\n",
      "Is it a fire hazard?\n",
      "There will be no fire hazards and no one's going to slip on it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So making sure things are safe and making sure things are tucked away within closets and in drawers is important to you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I'd like my plants on the wall back there to grow.\n",
      "I have two African Violets, and I keep them alive mostly.\n",
      "And they're plants that don't need much water.\n",
      "And that, I starve them to death for water because I can't see them.\n",
      "They're out of mind.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "They're out of mind because, okay, because you can't see them.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you, that makes sense.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:56:23] being able to sometimes pull it together.\n",
      "And there for a while, I was taking five quilting magazines.\n",
      "I just enjoy looking at them.\n",
      "I enjoy the mathematics of it.\n",
      "Does this fit, why does this fit together, or how would it go together, how would I do it differently if I were assembling this?\n",
      "But I don't do it... I do it mentally in my head, and I don't need to do it on fabric.\n",
      "I just collect the fabric.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So we've talked about this kind of already, but when you think about your possessions, what makes your possessions valuable?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "What makes them valuable?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), or how do you-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "In and of themselves, there is nothing that I own that is valuable, that I could take down to a pawn shop and get money for it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So not monetarily valuable.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Nothing monetarily valuable.\n",
      "But they're resources that I can use to check a hymn to see what hymn it is, or check a piece of scripture, or figure out how to do a particular technique, or how to do this stitch in embroidery.\n",
      "And those are my resources.\n",
      "I got a lot of them.\n",
      "Everyone is a little bit different, and I do an, what's the word, aggregate.\n",
      "I do something from all of it that I think makes it even better than any one.\n",
      "I do have an ego, and sometimes I outsmart myself by doing that because it doesn't work.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "But as far as what makes it valuable to me is the fact that I can use it to answer a question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so it's valuable if you can use it to answer a question.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah, I can do it now.\n",
      "I don't have to wait until I either ask the librarian at the library or find someone who knows.\n",
      "I can pick it up in a book.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How important are your things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, how valuable, important?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sorry, yeah, I kind of switched the question on you.\n",
      "So, yeah, so you talked about the things that are valuable are things that you use to answer questions and they're resources.\n",
      "How important are these things for you to feel at home?\n",
      "How much do you feel like you need them in order to feel at home?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah, a great deal.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A great deal, okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Not all the time.\n",
      "I mean, I figured that he was a little eccentric, and eccentric isn't a bad thing because I'm eccentric in some ways, like you're eclectic, but no. There's really no way, unless they have a smell, but some people have cooking smells related to their house.\n",
      "You really can't tell.\n",
      "You may have an inkling, but I would say if they're really bad, if they just have an unkempt appearance, like I'm talking about a hoarder.\n",
      "Maybe they have an unkempt appearance.\n",
      "They might have a smell, different things like that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "But, yeah.\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, sorry.\n",
      "So you said that you watch the show Hoarders.\n",
      "Where else do you get information about hoarding disorder, or where have you heard of it?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I think I read up a little bit on it a long time ago, but that was pretty much it.\n",
      "Just reading a couple of things.\n",
      "I know I have cluttering issues, so I looked it up a couple times just online.\n",
      "I don't remember the exact sites, but that's pretty much what I looked it up on, and even more recent because I'm like, \"Okay, this is getting a bit out of control.\"\n",
      "My mom brought it to my attention too and I was like, \"Okay, this is not good.\n",
      "It's never been this.\n",
      "I've always had a whole bunch of stuff, but it's never been like this before.\"\n",
      "Yeah, it was just too much.\n",
      "I had more clothes than you could imagine.\n",
      "It was ridiculous, and then I worked retail and going to school.\n",
      "I worked at Bath & Body Works, so every time there was a sale, I was buying $60 to $100 give or take on stuff.\n",
      "Every time we'd get a paycheck, they timed it so there would be different sales, and I was like, \"This is not [inaudible 00:33:44].\n",
      "You're just giving your money back to the company that pays you.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's dangerous.\n",
      "A sale every time?\n",
      "I cannot imagine if I worked somewhere and they just had a sale every time I got my paycheck.\n",
      "I'd be like, \"This is not good.\"\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Mm-mmm (negative).\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So how often did you watch the show Hoarders, and what did you get out of that?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Perhaps.\n",
      "For sure he has organizational problems.\n",
      "He keeps tools so he can use them.\n",
      "With that many tools scattered around the house, it's unlikely when he's looking for a [Vise by 16 Box in Wrench 00:52:11] he going to be able to find.\n",
      "He's looking for the number one Philips screwdriver [inaudible 00:52:19].\n",
      "Do something to et his tools organized so he can use them.\n",
      "And, Before if you leave stuff running around that stuff...I'll tell you what my son in law does to some if my tools when working on his garage.\n",
      "I think that guy has more of an organizational problem than a clutter problem.\n",
      "Terrible clutter problem also.\n",
      "For sure no tool in the world deserves to be store in the bathtub.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So in this case maybe he doesn't have as much stuff to count as having hoarding problems but you think he definitely has problem with organization, because there is no way he could be using those tools, probably if they're that disorganized?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "If he can organize himself, now hell just be a well equipped fellow.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Definitely I understand.\n",
      "S I have one more of these vineyard stories so bare with me okay?, We'll do another lady.\n",
      "\"Mary has several antiques that she keeps because she like them and she knows that they're valuable.\n",
      "She goes out once a week and buys more antiques.\n",
      "She's worried that she might get rid of an antique item that's worth a lot of money.\n",
      "Antiques occupy every room.\n",
      "Before entering her bathroom she has to remove several antique items.\n",
      "Often it's difficult for her to find her car keys and wallet and she'll spend 30 minutes to an hour looking for them.\n",
      "Until she eventually finds them or forgets what she was looking for.\n",
      "She's almost always to getting where she needs to go and sometimes she doesn't show up at all.\"\n",
      "Is this a person who has hoarding problems?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I think so, yes ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "She has an interference in using the bathroom appropriately.\n",
      "And she's really filled up her house to the point.\n",
      "By just a mental picture, she can't enjoy the antiques that she's collecting.\n",
      "So now I order twice the antiques so then I have to dust it be able to admire it sometimes.\n",
      "I have a box, with all the antiques that used to be a little more fluent one time I rode down, reproduction of the center.[inaudible 00:54:39] I can hardly see it right now because there's no place else fore it, amongst cardboard boxes.\n",
      "I'll take a little video of my roo after this conversation.[inaudible 00:54:49]\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So in this case of vineyard, She definitely does have hoarding problems according to your opinion.\n",
      "Because if she's got all these-[crosstalk 00:55:03].\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:55:07] please.\n",
      "P2: Yeah okay um so just the last part of that question was just to have you think through and this is just a useful exercise because it makes it very concrete um to think through a specific case or cases that was challenging for you to diagnose either clinically or in research because it was on the border between pathological and non pathological behavior um perhaps it was almost sub-clinical or for other reasons perhaps it was it was similar to another mental health disorder and on that border or again you give the example of one you don’t have cluttered house but you know had clutter in storage spaces so could you think of a specific case that was challenging for any of those reason and kind of talk through how you end up making the decision\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah sure I mean that the um if you hadn’t asked me about a specific case and just asked me what do I think is the biggest problem with the diagnostic criteria um for me it comes down to two things the first is the clutter criterion um I think the clutter criterion is fascination because it's almost like if we were to translate that to like OCD for example it would be like saying ‘let me see your hands are they bloody enough?\n",
      "Okay they are you have OCD’ and that’s not at all how we would diagnose OCD right?\n",
      "P2: Right right\n",
      "040\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "As you know, the study is investigating individual's attitudes and beliefs related to having hoarding disorder.\n",
      "The first question would be, what term you would prefer when we're talking about your difficulties with clutter or discarding?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "My difficulties with clutter?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Ma'am.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "The problem is I don't put things away.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you have a particular name you'd like to use.\n",
      "Some people prefer clutter difficulty.\n",
      "Some people prefer to hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Do you have a preferred term?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, no, not really.\n",
      "There are two aspects of events.\n",
      "One is, I put one project on top of the other, without putting the first project away.\n",
      "Many of the things that I use in the second project involve using the tools from the first project.\n",
      "But some things could be put away.\n",
      "Instead, they're simply swept aside and they're still there.\n",
      "The other thing is, everything is in the way.\n",
      "I know that goes right up against clutter.\n",
      "Make sure everything has its place and put it there.\n",
      "Two things are involved.\n",
      "One, is fabric and sewing machines, tools, rotary cutters, et cetera..\n",
      "That's one part of it.\n",
      "The other is, I have projects which have not yet been completed, which are now in boxes.\n",
      "I have a stack of fabric that I get from wherever.\n",
      "I never turn down fabric if someone has it to give me, which I can make bags for.\n",
      "Originally, much of that fabric was to make bags for the school kids at the United Methodist Church, as charity kind of thing, but they have stopped needing bags, just putting it in a big two gallon, so I don't need that material.\n",
      "But material or fabric, I can't bear to use it because then I won't have it to use.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "It sounds like a lot of this is dealing with fabric and having a lot of projects, but then when you use the fabric, you won't have it to use in the future.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "It's a convoluted thing in my mind.\n",
      "My thinking is, \"Participant 040, why can't you use it?\n",
      "That's what it's there for, period.\"\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are you okay with me using clutter problems as kind of that overarching term to describe that, or do you have something else you would prefer?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "An overarching terms for what now?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Just kind of when we're discussing difficulties with putting tools away or things with fabric.\n",
      "I'm just looking for a good term that I can use to kind of describe that as a whole.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "That has described that as a whole.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Maybe I'll think of it as we go along.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I also have that problem is, I'll think of things 15 minutes later, what the word is.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That happens to me too.\n",
      "I'll go-\n",
      "Interview 009\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. Now I want to talk a little bit about the DSM-5 criteria for hoarding disorder.\n",
      "Are there things about the DSM-5 criteria that you feel are sometimes challenging or particular elements that are difficult to apply where the different clinicians might apply differently?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think the DSM-5 criteria actually is quite well written, and the fact that they put insight and acquisition as specifiers rather than requirements is important.\n",
      "And that there does not necessarily need to be unusable living spaces if there’s an external agency person helping to keep the living area clean.\n",
      "I think that impairment criteria is very difficult to assess or can be difficult to assess.\n",
      "How do you… If there isn’t a huge amount of clutter how do you assess somebody who is in the early stages of hoarding disorder, for example.\n",
      "So for me, the problem is not people who have somewhat moderate to severe hoarding, its people who are in the early stages where we might want to intervene early and yet it’s not yet clear whether they meet the criteria.\n",
      "I think those folks are likely to get missed or underdiagnosed.\n",
      "The ones who are starting to have difficulty discarding and are starting to save but have not yet accumulated to the point where there is impairment.\n",
      "That’s where I would like to intervene, but they may not meet criteria.\n",
      "Interviewer: And that’s because the criteria almost necessitates a certain amount of time span, you think, to build up that degree of clutter, or?\n",
      "Interviewee: I don’t know if its time spent or absence of external factors controlling it, or if it’s just the natural progression of the disorder, but… and obviously all the DSM criteria, all the DSM diagnoses requires a level of impairment or distress, but I think that the focus on clutter as one of the primary mechanisms of impairment is good at the severe end, but may not be good in the early stages.\n",
      "It may be distress that’s more relevant there.\n",
      "And I think that may be, well I think that people will say “Well your beds are not full of clutter therefore you can’t have hoarding disorder,” and I think that’s where we might get into trouble.\n",
      "For such a new disorder though, I mean I think this will become more of a problem as time goes on, right.\n",
      "That right now what we want is for people to recognize the disorder as such and diagnose it in those cases that are clear.\n",
      "And some of the more subtle ones, they’re important but we have a long ways to go before…\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So now I want to ask you some questions about the way you think about specific phrases or portions of the DSM-5 criteria.\n",
      "So I’m going to read you a phrase and I’d like to know more about your thought process as you apply that to individual patients.\n",
      "So with “persistent difficulty discarding or parting regardless of their actual value,” how are you determining value?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "A great deal.\n",
      "The interesting part about the books though is that frequently I can find the answer on the Google.\n",
      "[inaudible 01:00:17] drink [inaudible 01:00:18] of water.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I can find those answers on Google.\n",
      "Just look up anything.\n",
      "People have put on YouTube the...\n",
      "No, I don't use Facebook, but YouTube, the answers to your questions are myriad, and so I'm beginning to realize that maybe I don't have to have all of these books.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Because the answers are on Google or YouTube.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah, I just have to learn how to use a computer.\n",
      "My husband was a librarian and he worked with government documents for 30 years, and he thinks like a librarian.\n",
      "So sometimes I'll ask him, \"What shall I ask?\n",
      "What shall I put in there?\" And I can't find the answer, but he can.\n",
      "So as far as a resource, my husband is [inaudible 01:01:36].\n",
      "He's smart.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Sounds like he has a lot of information.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Sounds like I what?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I said it sounds like he has a lot of information and a lot of knowhow.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So at the opposite of value, what would you consider to be trash, and what do you discard?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "What would I...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Consider to be...\n",
      "Oh, sorry.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "That's a hard one.\n",
      "I would...\n",
      "Well, there are books that maybe I could get at the library, I wouldn't have to keep it.\n",
      "I could give them away.\n",
      "I can't think of anything that would be trash.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "So, do you ever have to decide, or do you ever make a decision that it's time to throw something away, or is that something that's difficult?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, if it truly is trash, like a wrapper-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so like something like a wrapper would be-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Especially if it's something that I don't have to launder or don't have to do something with, that the answer's on the label.\n",
      "Jars and cans, we got to recycle.\n",
      "I just put them in the sack and I want to make sure they get out to the recycle.\n",
      "And I do recycle.\n",
      "But on the other hand, there are some of these soda bottles that have a beautiful top, and if I take the soda bottles and cut them off, they would make beautiful bells, which is part of these three bucks as a Christmas things.\n",
      "We got a new Christmas tree.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "A smaller one, because the big one didn't fit.\n",
      "And I've been trying to make smaller two inch ornaments, but it's more of a thought and a resource than it is an actual fact.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "It's like I'm going to do it someday.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Okay, so it's a resource.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I have three moderately sized cardboard boxes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Of bottle caps?\n",
      "P2: Yeah um I mean that sounds good to me I certainly hadn’t thought about that until you brought it up but I think that would be a really good outcome from the interviews that were doing to try to put something like that together um and so yeah one way that we could move forward is certainly when we’ve done a bunch of interviews with with experts so we’re interviewing experts starting with experts but I think that we’re going to work out towards the periphery once we are able to with out time and kind of resource constraints and use that to make a survey that we could like you said really front line people who are understanding this disorder and I think it will be interesting to try to build that component like to what extent is that due to popular media depictions of it to you know to what extent is it really strictly based on the DSM five and you know and you know to really see you know also I would be interested in knowing how much your average frontline social worker um psychiatrist or psychologist encounters this in their practice like is this an issue everyday or is think something they have never heard about or thought about so yeah we could certainly do that when we are in a further stage in our interviews um I think that also something I think about that we have talked about would be really great to have you be involved with this we’ve talked about kind of out of theses clinicians interviews kind of coming up with a smaller group of really of key informants or key experts who we can talk through the issues um the emerge as we as we catch them like maybe have a working group of something from the study that we can touch base with periodically either via phone or email and say you know ‘we’re interested in this but what should we do?\n",
      "how should we ask this question?\n",
      "um how should we put this to patients?’ you know and how do we act as kind of uh a consultant or kind of advisor particularly if we move into the patient interview component um which hopefully we will be doing um at the end of the summer and the fall um and so if you would be interested in that we would\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah sure\n",
      "P2: Really value your input as we because its all kind of taking shape the the wonderful thing about qualitative methodology from my perspective is its very exploratory it lets you cast a really broad net and that something that kind of where we are right now we’re going to kind of take stock of what we’ve caught in that board net and see what pieces are interesting and when we get to that it would be\n",
      "Interviewee: No that sounds perfect\n",
      "P2: Helpful to touch base with you again and say you know we really want to understand this is something that we found in our interviews and we really want to understand better how should we how should we move on to the next stage or how do we get at that um\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah no that sounds great really good\n",
      "P1: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer: How well in terms of how the therapy combats the anxiety?\n",
      "Are there things that need to be discussed about how that looks, what that looks like?\n",
      "Speaker: umm Maybe let them know that they may have to…and again I don’t know how far it is gonna go because for we just started week two, but they are gonna have to face some of their fears.\n",
      "I mean I wouldn’t word it so that it scares them because it might turn some kids away, but umm be prepare to learn to stand up to, stand up to your fears more you know\n",
      "Speaker: And how it makes you stronger\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: and your fears weaker.\n",

      "Interviewer: Yeah\n",
      "Speaker: That they are going to have to be brave, you know when they come here.\n",
      "Interviewer: Should there be discussions about how it worked for other kids?\n",
      "Speaker: I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer: Yeah, especially I think if you are discussing or having prior individuals who moved on through therapy kind of discussing it.\n",
      "Speaker: Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "Interviewer: How much if we do take that route, how much of their story should be discussed cause’ I’m curious about a contrast between the story of the kids who have gone through vs the potential the viewer and what it might look like as you see, as you both have alluded to it very much depends on each kid, so?\n",
      "Speaker: What was the um…what was the nucleus of that question?\n",
      "[Laughs] I’m sorry, say that again.\n",
      "I lost you.\n",
      "Interviewer: um its ok, I lost myself as well.\n",
      "Um doing how its worked for other kids and how maybe having kids speaking about their own experiences vs having it more about the person viewing it and how they can relate…\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "Speaker: I think, yeah.\n",
      "I think um maybe…maybe that character and it could be more than one could be a real child’s story and then somehow in the end that child might say my name is blah bablah and not their real name obviously.\n",
      "You know, my name is and I’m so happy that I was able to go through whatever because I have blah bablah and they helped, I don’t know.\n",
      "That’s all I can really thing of maybe using an example of a real person um\n",
      "Speaker: Or even if just made up an example and just gave them a name.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right.\n",
      "Speaker: Even though everyone’s story and everyone’s experience is going to be a little different.\n",
      "Just a couple of examples of you know\n",
      "41: 50 Speaker: the common themes like the common um maybe something that you know a lot of kids are dealing with, OCD you know, I don’t know if its perfectionism or…\n",
      "Interviewer: Contamination\n",
      "Speaker: Contamination, yeah exactly yeah.\n",
      "Speaker: Or you won’t stop until you get it just right.\n",
      "Speaker: Right… If you use some of those, a few of those really common themes you know and just maybe show one kid from each.\n",
      "Interviewer: like show the variety and how we talked about how it presents itself in different ways.\n",
      "Um so we talked about how you don’t think that its necessary to really talk about like what anxiety is, um do you think its worth talking about explicitly at least for the children how exposures really work and how they…?\n",
      "Speaker: I think very delicately.\n",
      "Interview: Delicately.\n",
      "Speaker: Because you don’t want to scare them.\n",
      "Interviewer: Could you elaborate on that on what you mean delicately, like to you what does that look like to you?\n",
      "Speaker: Well I’m just thinking about my son like I know the things that are some of his greatest fears/phobia type things coming into this and just with the mention of exposure therapy with him, he became very uncomfortable which is normal I guess you know, so um I don’t think you wanna make the anxiety greater.\n",
      "43: 27 Speaker: You don’t want to scare them off.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like when you were telling me about how this all developed, that while your wife was alive you were able to kep it a little bit more in-check because she wouldn't stand for it, does that sounds right?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Pretty much.\n",
      "She had a garage sale every six months or a year.\n",
      "So if I really wanted stuff then I could by it back from her.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "So she was very active in getting rid of your stuff.\n",
      "She was a big proponent of every six months she would go through and purge and if it meant that much to you, you'd have to pay for it.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And then after she passed, it sounds like your house just kind of filled up.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "That's exactly right, to tell you the truth, ma'am, this is something that somebody said in the '60s, if I could only tell who it was then I'd quote the person.\n",
      "A man without a woman is like a ship without a rudder, but the woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "And I said that all the time.\n",
      "I hang out with some of the seniors settled here, educational groups for seniors.\n",
      "They're bringing and asking me right now because of the virus, I remember seeing guys who came with us and just stumble around lost might not see anything that the ...\n",
      "Here's the thing.\n",
      "What it was when [inaudible 00:33:48] why don't you just keep on chugging and see what's ... that's her husband.\n",
      "No, [inaudible 00:33:55].\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:33:55].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, it's the same.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "And I never realized how much stuff my wife did for me.\n",
      "Christmas cards, birthdays, and stuff like that.\n",
      "I never had a clue how much she was doing for me until she didn't do it anymore.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I understand that, yeah.\n",
      "So it sounds like you have it more or less under control now because you're living with your daughter and your son-in-law.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "It's just very limited, yes ma'am, but the physical constraints, yes ma'am.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Did you ever try to ger help from either a professional?\n",
      "Like see a psychologist or a professional organizer to help you to deal with this problem or was it something that you just dealt with on your own with your wife?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I never thought of it as being the sort of a problem that might be amenable to improvement.\n",
      "That never crossed my mind, till this conversation with you right now to be honest with you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Uh-huh (affirmative).\n",
      "So you just thought, \"This is how I am and this is how I'll always be.\"\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And it's just a matter of how am I going to manage my stuff?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well no, not...\n",
      "Well, the... let's see.\n",
      "The sodas, the tops kind of swirls.\n",
      "It would pretty just to put some [inaudible 01:04:35] lace or [inaudible 01:04:35] around the bottom of it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you have three boxes of those.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "They're cluttering up the...\n",
      "No, wait a minute.\n",
      "They're both places, both the dining room and what we used to call the dead sea.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I decided I did not like the term dead sea because it was the room at the end of a hall.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Oh. Participant 040:\n",
      "Things went in, but they never came out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, so you call it the dead sea because a lot of stuff accumulated there and they wouldn't come back out?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, that's that room I've taken over in the back.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "And it's the room that has the six inch space that you have to go sideways to get through.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay, got you.\n",
      "So would you say that overall it's difficult for you to throw things away?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I apologize if I've asked that.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Unless they're truly trash.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, unless they're truly trash, like a wrapper.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah, a candy wrapper.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "A candy wrapper.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "That goes in the trash.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Tissues, dirty tissues.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Those go in the trash, okay.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I had a problem with...\n",
      "Well, I would gurgle up food reflex.\n",
      "It was quite bad and I could fill a small trash can quickly with tissues.\n",
      "And they went in the trash.\n",
      "They did not get saved.\n",
      "What else do I have no trouble throwing away?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It's okay-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "[inaudible 01:06:28] labels.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Labels?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "You'd think I'd save them, but I throw them out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What would you say is the most precious item in your house for you?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "My most precious item?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative), if you had to pick one thing.\n",
      "Or I guess a type of thing.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Well, the lightening hit the back of the house in that dining room and started to burn.\n",
      "And I asked the firemen to go into the sewing room and bring out the embroidered silk.\n",
      "It was going to be used for my mother of the bride.\n",
      "Well, I saved that.\n",
      "The house didn't burn down, it just a lot of smoke, but that whole back room had to be re-done.\n",
      "And that was one of the things I had found that finally, and it's irrational to have saved three yards of silk on a roll, but I did and he did, and I held it very carefully in my hand outside while we watched the firemen.\n",
      "My new concept of a mess is a shag carpet filled with wet plaster and [inaudible 01:08:25].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I watch Hoarders all the time, and hoarders have no regard for what it is that they're keeping.\n",
      "I know everyone is different, but ...\n",
      "Well no, I wouldn't say that.\n",
      "After a while, they just become blind to the mess.\n",
      "I dated someone who was a hoarder, and I was like, \"Oh my God.\"\n",
      "He took me to his house and it was ... terrible.\n",
      "They didn't have any pets or anything, so it wasn't like animal droppings or anything, but [inaudible 00:28:48] a mess.\n",
      "We broke up because, yeah.\n",
      "His father was a hoarder and he picked up those tendencies from him, so it was just paper everywhere, dust on everything.\n",
      "You have a vacuum cleaner, but I'm sure you've never used it.\n",
      "Kid stuff from when he was four or five years old, just hanging different places.\n",
      "The basement was full of stuff from the '70s because his father is older, so stuff from the '70s and '80s.\n",
      "Like they have analog TVs in the basement.\n",
      "His room, just a mess.\n",
      "His sister's room, even though his sister left, a mess.\n",
      "Just stuff everywhere, and then ...\n",
      "You know how sometimes stuff has an old smell?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Like that-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "But for him.\n",
      "Yeah, but for him, he was so used to it.\n",
      "He's like [inaudible 00:30:01].\n",
      "I'm like, \"No, this is gross.\n",
      "I don't like this.\"\n",
      "So he had an idea that it was bad and he really didn't have people over, so the few times that I was over to stay for maybe an hour, two hours at most, that was really pushing it for me.\n",
      "It was a lot.\n",
      "When I would get home, I just would immediately take off my clothes and take a shower because it was gross.\n",
      "It was gross.\n",
      "I really wish I would've took pictures, but I was just being a good girlfriend and didn't do that, but ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah, so no concept of that, and cleaning was just ... not something that they would really do.\n",
      "I tried to help him clean, well I offered to help him clean, but he's like, \"I have to do it myself,\" and then his dad would get upset if he would clean any area that he was in.\n",
      "It was just bad.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So do you think there's a way to tell that someone has a hoarding disorder without being in their home?\n",
      "P2: Mhm um okay so the last piece of the interview we’d like to go through with you is again about the way that patients come in to treatment or come in for um for studies um an just based on your experience we’ve kind of covered some of this already so um I don’t want to make you repeat yourself too much but just when thinking of a patient or just kind of in the form of a narrative could you please describe the typical process that usually occurs to get patients to your office either for treatment or for study and participation what happens in your experiences to patients before they get there?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um I think that it is very different depending on whether its for a research study or whether its for a treatment reason um and so for research study I I find that a lot of these patients are kind of interested and intrigued about learning stuff and being part of a bigger thing and so for research um you know as long as they kind of have the whereabouts to self identify and say ‘oh I many have this hoarding thing’ um then we find it pretty easy to have them come in um they are also the only patient groups I've ever worked with where people are you know often enough where it's noticeable um they refuse payment (laughing) like ‘no no it's okay take the money’ they’re like ‘no I want to just help contribute to science’ you know it's like that’s great good thank you um for the treatment piece of it I oftentimes think they have reached a certain point where they are in distress or impairment or the like griping from outside forces has reached high enough threshold where it's finally become pain enough for the patient to come in so I think the conversation is really different but even then they aren’t always ready to purse CBT treatment um in which case you know then uh well that’s part of the reason we have them go though the help group first and then the CBT group\n",
      "P2: Um so just in terms of the motivations that they have do you feel like the people who are involved in getting them to your office are most frequently um like family members and friends and if so which family members in in particular do you find are the most involved with this process?\n",
      "Interviewee: Um well what’s interesting is that when we have family members call um usually those are folks that the patients themselves are super not ready to change and then if its cases where the patients themselves is calling in um often times we don’t in those cases work with the family does that make sense?\n",
      "P2: So if the family’s calling then usually it's because the patient won't but if the patient is ready we don’t really hear from the families as much (1:44:41)\n",
      "Interviewee: Right the the few exceptions to that is if the patient is living with their family\n",
      "P2: Mhm mhm\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "And I got rewarded.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, well that was a good example.\n",
      "Have you ever sought to change your behavior or gone to a professional?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I saw a psychologist for...but that was not about hoarding.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "So I don't think I ever considered, I never thought of the point that I had gotten to as a serious enough problem to see someone.\n",
      "I have other problems to deal with.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I think one reason that it didn't become a problem was because as I grew older I had more space and space can be a problem for someone but I never got to a point where I needed a storage locker like some people.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "So you never went specifically for hoarding it was for other things?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Definitely not, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You mentioned that your mom and your brother have issues with hoarding as well but how do your other family members and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I think they're amused by me because of the rabbits that I pull out of my 40 year old boxes.\n",
      "The music collecting, people have known me for years and they know my interest in music.\n",
      "I think I'm fairly open about what level I've been at and we've visited with friends over the last few days and we talked about the process that we've been going through of cleaning things out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "So I don't have an issue with friends.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So now we're going to go into a section more about the space that you live in.\n",
      "Do you live alone or is their someone that lives with you?\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "I live with my spouse.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What is the space like?\n",
      "I know you mentioned you've been decluttering your garage but could you describe-\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "We have a single car garage with a lot of shelves and on those shelves...do you want me to describe my accumulations or just the physical layout?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You can describe both, just how your house is with your stuff in it.\n",
      "Participant 37:\n",
      "Okay, so the garage has shelving, some of which came with the unit and I realized how large it was so I bought more shelves.\n",
      "I had bins [inaudible 00:19:19] so I still have bins of things on the garage shelves, I have boxes in the crawl space in the garage.\n",
      "Upstairs we have a large kitchen, a large dining room, a large living room.\n",
      "Upstairs we have three bedrooms, one of which is my room of declutter where I'm trying to get rid of things and digitize music.\n",
      "And then above that room there's another crawl space which also has more boxes of my stuff.\n",
      "Does that give you enough?\n",
      "Speaker: No, my wife is the one that got him started and kept up with it because I thought we were working on a total attention deficit until she told me.\n",
      "Interviewer: That’s completely fine.\n",
      "When you first learned about the kind of therapy we do here, do you remember any questions you had and what you knew about CBT prior to?\n",
      "Speaker: The questions was does it have to be everyday does he have to miss school so much?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Were there any other questions other than that?\n",
      "Speaker: I was wondering if it was going to work.\n",
      "Interviewer: Fair.\n",
      "How much did you know about CBT from movies, TV, the internet or other people?\n",
      "Speaker: Not very much.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "So thinking about your experience were there any parts of the therapy that were confusing for you?\n",
      "Speaker: No patient; I mean each instructor, each therapist was very clear in explaining what they were doing.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "What would you want to tell somebody who was about to start cognitive behavior therapy?\n",
      "Speaker: Like I would tell the m it works.\n",
      "Like I said I was very hesitant at first to seeing how much time it consumes to be in this type of therapy.\n",
      "And I was shocked at how quick it works.\n",
      "Interviewer: So that’s what you would tell someone who was about to start?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Think of three words that describe how you felt about CBT when you first learned about it.\n",
      "What would those words be?\n",
      "Speaker: I was confused because I didn’t know what it was to begin with.\n",
      "I have never really looked for it in a person so I never got to see it yet it was right there in my son.\n",
      "So I don’t know the three words.\n",
      "Interviewer: So if you could think of three words, three words that came to mind, do you think of any of; can you think of any?\n",
      "Speaker: I could think of the results but three words.\n",
      "Speaker: Anything that came to mind when you first learned about it when you were sitting there, maybe in session, maybe it was post talking to your child.\n",
      "Speaker: I didn’t know how complex it was.\n",
      "Interviewer: So complex is one?\n",
      "Speaker: Yes.\n",
      "Uh, I didn’t have much faith until he started to put it into practice and then I was pleased.\n",
      "Interviewer: So we have complex is one.\n",
      "Can you think of any other two by chance?\n",
      "Speaker: It was educational.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Complex and educational.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes and you have to have patience.\n",
      "Interviewer: So it sounds like your three words are complex, educational, and the third word would be describing how you felt when you learned about CBT\n",
      "Speaker: I was overjoyed.\n",
      "Interviewer: Overjoyed.\n",
      "Ok. So complex, educational, overjoyed sound like the three words that describe how you felt.\n",
      "Speaker: Yes, as he went through it yes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok sounds good.\n",
      "If you were to add a picture to each of these words what would it look like?\n",
      "So pictures of complex, what would that look like?\n",
      "What would a vision of complex look like?\n",
      "Speaker: It would be a little boy looking at a brief case and not realizing that someone was coming to the door and as it went on he knew what was coming in through the door without worrying about the briefcase.\n",
      "That almost happened with my son.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "I would have to shove things aside if someone came.\n",
      "The top of the bookcase would not be loaded with books.\n",
      "There might be something pretty on it, but no, it's got more books.\n",
      "There's no room for pretty.\n",
      "No knickknacks around.\n",
      "My children did tell me I didn't have any pictures around, photographs.\n",
      "So I had opportunity to get some photographs.\n",
      "My younger daughter's wedding, she presented me with pictures of everybody who attended the wedding, the family.\n",
      "And from there, I started to put other little pictures.\n",
      "That's now almost 13 years old.\n",
      "And the pictures of my grandchildren and my in-laws and such.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So it sounds-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "That's very neat.\n",

      "I didn't get an angel put away, so an angel's there and there's a box of candy.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So-\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:53:06] covered.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So overall, ideally, you would like to be able to have people be able sit on your living room couch, and you'd like to be able to put out some decorations and stuff like that, but those are things that you just can't do.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah, not too much, not too much.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Because they're dust catchers.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "But just the idea that I could.\n",
      "I've got some really nice pieces of Maud Humphrey figurines.\n",
      "I owned a store for a while, and I've got a couple of those, and I should put those out.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Are there parts of your home that you don't currently use?\n",
      "So it sounds like the kitchen stays pretty clean because of your husband.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "And it sounds like the bathroom is pretty clean as well.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So are there any parts of your house that can't be used the way that they were meant to because of things being on them or stuff like that?\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "The dining room table, the dining room, we added an addition on the back to give us a dining room so that my mother and my family, both families, my daughter's families, you have 13, 14 around the table, and there would be no way.\n",
      "This is a small house, one of those starter houses that people get into, you know when they have kids, or one young child.\n",
      "And we finished off the basement, which gave us some more room.\n",
      "But without that room back there...\n",
      "I've sort of taken it over too with stacks of fabric and stacks of things that I haven't quite gotten around to.\n",
      "What's known in the sewing/quilting trade is UFOs, unfinished object [crosstalk 00:55:18].\n",
      "UFOs, unfinished objects.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's funny.\n",
      "I haven't heard that before.\n",
      "Participant 040:\n",
      "And there are a few of those in there.\n",
      "I look at it and I say, \"Hmm, I'm tired,\" or I'll do part of a cleaning project and give up, never quite get back to finishing picking up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Got you.\n",
      "P2: And it's not just about overvalued ideation it's about how much how a space should look how a normal home looks like\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah exactly mhm\n",
      "P2: That is important and I think that you are right um so one interesting idea that we’ve heard about this I just want to kind of run by you is that there is a difficulty for clinicians sometimes when talking about insight and that um there’s two things going on one thing is recognizing that the behavior is a problem and the other is the behavior itself so um there’s insight in that you know the behavior problematic but then there’s also insight that you have to know that you know that the saving you shouldn’t save so I don’t know if I'm phrasing that well but it something that came up in our most recent interview is that there’s a degree that insight its kind of part of hoarding disorder if you really know that you shouldn’t save stuff um then there is another level that is able to get rid of it level its very difficult to distinguish I don’t know if I'm making this INAUDIBLE (1:26:27)\n",
      "Interviewee: No I think that whoever said that is spot on I think that a really important distinction it would be like you know with with hurricane Irma we had a lot of patients call us you know before the storm and just say ‘I just wish it would just take it all away I wish the storm would come in and just take it all away’ I would not say that all of those patients were the most kind of um high on insight but it really kind of reflects this part like ‘okay great I recognize that I have a problem but I don’t recognize that I have control over my behavior’\n",
      "P2: Mhm mhm\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that INAUDIBLE (1:27:18)\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (1:27:18) – would be better without this stuff but still\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "P2: That’s really interesting um so we want to talk a little bit more about a couple of the things that you said um so one of the things that you mentioned that we’ve been thinking about is kind of the way you could or might operationalize inside of this population uh and we listed a paper that had kind of broken down the the different constructs that are and we wanted you to just kind of talk through the extent that you think that these constructs are useful with your patients so I’ll just read you the list and and we can go through them one by one or you can talk about any one of them that you think is more or less interesting so the constructs that we listed we’re defensiveness um agnosia which is just like a lack of ability to perceive the illness or whether something is wrong overvalued ideation which is the persistent and unreal belief in the potential value of items indifferent and indifference is the last one so defensiveness agnosia overvalued ideation and indifference um so just thinking through those as potential kind of pieces or parts of insight do you think that any of them are more or less important in this disorder um for different qualifications different times and how would you use those ideas to come up with a more concrete idea of insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: What paper is that?\n",
      "That’s great\n",
      "P1: Um I think it’s uh a INAUDIBLE (1:22:58) from uh I I can’t remember\n",
      "Interviewee: Oh of course it is NAME (1:23:02)\n",
      "P2: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewee: I’ll have to read that again um I think defensiveness and overvalued ideation are relevant across the board I think indifference can be relevant and and that part about just have a complete like you're just really not able to recognize that it’s a problem yeah I think that’s really relevant for something like squalor or animal hoarding and I guess it could also be relevant for object hoarding it just I think less common\n",
      "P2: Uhuh and kind of thinking through again um the process of gaining and the patients being maybe being at different levels of insight at different times do you think that theses different kind of insight are relevant at all to that idea?\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah because like the defensiveness like if you are tapping on something or like I guess I think of the defensiveness as kind of going along with the control idea um I guess maybe just something that just isn’t capturing so well is I do think is an issue with some patients is that they don’t have the same definition for what is a clean home or what’s like an uncluttered space so those would be like patients who your showing them a clutter image rating and they’re like ‘oh my god look at this room that’s a nine this is horrible how could somebody live like that’ and then you ask them what their living room looks like and their like ‘oh it think it might be like a seven’ (laughing) and it like INAUDIBLE (1:25:01)\n",
      "P2: INAUDIBLE (1:25:01) most people don’t live at a seven\n",
      "Interviewee: INAUDIBLE (1:25:03) don’t live at seven but like seven and a nine aren’t really that different to me so (laughing)\n",
      "P2: So that’s another aspect of insight that is represented here is kind of seeing their behavior um on a scale of normal\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So now I have something yet to read you, and I'm just going to as some questions about them, okay?\n",
      "So here's the first one, \"John Doe has several boxes that he keeps in case he needs to store something or decide to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to his house-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "That was me, from very recently, keep going.\n",

      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "\" When items are delivered to his house, he keeps the container that the item came in.\n",
      "He's worried that he might get rid of a box that he'll need later.\n",
      "There are stocks of boxes I one of his closets, but there's no boxes in any of the other rooms.\n",
      "His house was not only as organized but he's usually not cluttered, Occasionally he'll find it difficult to find his car keys and wallet, so he'll spend a few minutes until he eventually finds them.\n",
      "When this happens, he is very early late in getting where he needs to be.\"\n",
      "Would you say that this is a person who has hoarding problems?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "No. Interviewer:\n",
      "How come?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "There's a chance he's staying with his wife.\n",
      "Look at who he was, he dust have a problem right now.\n",
      "I have a [inaudible 00:48:04].\n",
      "Can I call you back in three minutes please?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Ye, of course.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Questions here, okay?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "[inaudible 00:48:25] it's my wife that did most of that work and I'm lucky enough to reap the benefits of her wonderful children.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "We need to do the next little [vernet 00:48:38] here and you can tell me the same thing again, whether or not you think this is a person with hoarding problems.\n",
      "So we talked about John Doe, now lets talk about Jane Doe.\n",
      "\" Jane Doe has several boxes that she keeps in case she need to store something or decides to move.\n",
      "When items are delivered to her house, she keeps the container, the item came in.\n",
      "She's worried that she might get rid of a box she'll need later.\n",
      "Stocks of boxes occupy every room, before entering into her bathroom, she must remove several stacks of boxes.\n",
      "Her house is extremely cluttered and it's difficult for her to walk in her house.\n",
      "Often it's difficult for Jane doe to find her keys and wallet.\n",
      "And shell spend 30 minuets to an hour looking for them until she eventually finds them or forgets what she was looking for.\n",
      "She's almost always late in getting where she needs to be and sometimes does not show up at all.\"\n",
      "Do you think that this is a problem for Jane Doe?\n",
      "Do you think that she's a person who has hoarding problem?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I do, definitely it sounds like a safety problem too.\n",
      "She need to be a volunteer [fireman 00:49:41].\n",
      "And that's the kind of stuff you know, you don't want to encounter.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay. I know you mentioned it upsets your mom.\n",
      "Does it upset anyone else in your family?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "No, it doesn't because it's just my mom, my brother, and I. My brother, he has his own room, and all of my stuff is contained to my room, and then the garage but the garage was organized so it's like my stuff is on one side and my mom's stuff is on the other side, so there's no overlap.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So I know you mentioned that one of your exes had a hoarding problem.\n",
      "Did he ever find your clutter problems were an issue in your relationship, or was it mainly you were just having a problem with his problem?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "I was having a problem with his problem because his problems became my [crosstalk 00:40:47].\n",
      "In the short period of time, that was a short relationship, but that was a lot.\n",
      "Nice guy, but we were just on different wavelengths.\n",
      "He was very complacent and had a defeated sense of self.\n",
      "He said that I was too serious.\n",
      "His priorities were not the best, like he'd rather invest money on video games and play [inaudible 00:41:27] than spending time with his girlfriend.\n",
      "So his priorities aren't going towards getting a car, because I've always had a car.\n",
      "He didn't plan for any of that.\n",
      "I knew I never should've dated someone without a car.\n",
      "Like I said I wouldn't date someone without a car in Florida, so why would I date someone without a car in a different state?\n",
      "Yeah, it was just always an argument like with, \"Okay, why don't you let me help you clean up this?\", or, \"Why don't you do this this way?\" We weren't good for one another.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you think his behavior affected you in either a positive or negative way at all?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "A negative way.\n",
      "You heard how I was just telling you, like just dealing with him, it triggered a need to be, I'm not blaming everything on him because of course I have to take responsibility, but it definitely was negative because the relationship that we had was not a positive situation.\n",
      "He really wasn't able to offer any support with depression or with clutter besides just words.\n",
      "It wasn't like he was coming to see me.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So no, it was negative-\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "No, I just wasn't sure if when you mentioned that you had gone to therapy if that was the same boyfriend or if it was a different one.\n",
      "I-\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "No, it was the same.\n",
      "No, it was the same.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "I should've clarified that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Do you feel lie you've been doing it more or less since that started?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "No significant different changes.\n",
      "Maybe the difference is, I don't go out to buy stuff and bring it home anymore.[inaudible 00:40:47], I never did do a lot of that anyway.\n",
      "I used to buy spare [inaudible 00:40:52].\n",
      "I still stop to pick up [crosstalk 00:40:56] in the parking lot.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "You do it less since this COVID situation started because you're going out less?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Right think so.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Have you had more time to organize since you've been at home more?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Oh yes, I had time to do I if I really desired.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "Do you feel like it's impacted your physical or your mental health at all to have this whole situation going on?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I just got back to my physical health, so much I can still get out and about and we have some fire extinguishers along the trail here.[inaudible 00:41:29] while I was stuck here in this development\n",
      "I had to keep myself entertained I dint thinks there was ever a period where I was physically too much.\n",
      "I haven't been able to get my teeth cleaned for a while, that a concern.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative) .\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Either than that no. Normal health.\n",
      "I don't get to socialize with peers anymore.\n",
      "That's an important thing for Cleveland people in general really to be able to[inaudible 00:42:01] socially.\n",
      "Good news is we have FaceTime, that helps a lot I used to FaceTime call with my children and guys like me don't do FaceTime calls with other guys.\n",
      "We get together at the Seniors Center and we heard one thing that's happened but that's different in real life, in person.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n",
      "So it's been harder to connect with friends?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "FaceTime helps a lot with family.\n",
      "With grandchildren.\n",
      "I'm lucky enough to have grandsons here in Albuquerque with my younger daughter, she's a [inaudible 00:42:40] laws of business, working for [LOCATION 00:42:41] here in Albuquerque.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You have a smart family.\n",
      "A lot of very intelligent people in your family.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "It's not a lost family, it's frightening.\n",
      "I was talking about the sheriff and his mother and father [inaudible 00:42:41].\n",
      "I'm the only person here with a Bachelor of Science Degree everybody else has PhD's and MD's.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Wow, that's amazing.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Just last week my oldest son [inaudible 00:43:23] out there called up, and made a FaceTime call to me and he plays new stuff on his Ukulele.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's amazing.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Two years ago he just...\n",
      "To play fathers musical and anyway, yeah I enjoyed it.[inaudible 00:43:26] not only being able to hang out with[inaudible 00:43:47].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "So, it sounds like FaceTime with your family has been a major source of comfort for you, given all that's been going on.\n",
      "Is there anything else you've been doing to cope with that problem?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Now I don't because I feel like I have it under better control and I'm still honestly working on getting rid of more things in my room that I don't use, like giving them away to people because I want to make better habits.\n",
      "I'm not always going to live with my family, so it's under much better control because with a move, you get rid of a lot of things that you don't need.\n",
      "My mom was like, \"You don't need all this stuff,\" and I really didn't.\n",
      "So it was just conceptualizing, \"What do I need and what don't I need?\" It's much better now.\n",
      "Since the move, I've been sorting through and using what I have versus shopping for new things all the time.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you ever gone to professional help for this behavior?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Well, mostly with depression, but it's been both.\n",
      "It helped me with that, so yes.\n",
      "I have,\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How did you find that person?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "Through counseling?\n",
      "You know, you talk to a therapist and they suggest different tools.\n",
      "It was through a healthcare provider.\n",
      "I told them the issues that I was having and then they referred me to therapy.\n",
      "It's different in Maryland; they give you certain people you can go to and then you find who you would like to go to, and that's what I did.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How do your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Have you ever had conflicts with them about it?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "With my mom, yeah, because she's like, \"You don't need all this stuff.\"\n",
      "Sometimes she just would come in and just clean my room for me.\n",
      "I mean it would look nice, but you want to do that yourself.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How about friends?\n",
      "Participant 041:\n",
      "No. I mean it's like a two-edged sword.\n",
      "The stuff that I have is all things that are practical.\n",
      "A lot of the things that I had, it utilized the room, but no. No one's ever said, \"Oh Participant 041, you look a mess\" or anything like that because I don't look a mess.\n",
      "People wouldn't [inaudible 00:12:14], \"Oh, you just have a lot of stuff,\" but besides having a lot of stuff, it's never caused conflict, which is always, when I lived on campus, people would always come into my room and want to touch everything, but as for conflict and stuff, besides home and just getting rid of a lot of things that I don't use, no.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So you said right now that you live back home with your family.\n",
      "What does the space look like?\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok. In that literature, there’s been a breakdown of the concept of insight into many different constructs including defensiveness, anosognosia, or lack of ability to perceive your illness when something is wrong with your quality of life, overvalued ideation, indifference.\n",
      "In your experience are any of these more prevalent or more problematic in your work with these individuals?\n",
      "Interviewee: Probably anosognosia and, to a lesser degree, not overvalued ideation but overvalued beliefs that these are going to be needed in the future, somebody is going to need these in the future.\n",
      "Indifference is not usually a problem.\n",
      "And what was the first one?\n",
      "Interviewer: And defensiveness.\n",
      "Interviewee: Defensiveness is a secondary phenomenon, I think, around, for people who have insight, a need to, well, defend their symptoms and behaviors, but I think it’s tied to insight.\n",
      "I don’t think it’s a measure of insight.\n",
      "It’s a proxy, I think, you can get at insight a little bit.\n",
      "You can imply that people have some level of insight if they’re defensive, but I don’t think it’s a direct measure of insight.\n",
      "You do see it, though.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, you cannot have defensiveness without insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: Without a modicum of insight at least.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Can you describe some of the typical processes that occur in order to get patients to your office for treatment or study participation.\n",
      "Do you feel like it’s normally self-motivated or by others?\n",
      "Interviewee: In my experience it’s been both, most of the people who come and stick in treatment it’s self-motivated.\n",
      "Sometimes the family member is pushing them to come, but again, they don’t tend to stick unless there is some individual motivation.\n",
      "And then I have had court ordered cases as well.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "How long has the hoarding behavior been going on before you typically see patients?\n",
      "Interviewee: At the very least a decade and usually much longer.\n",
      "I’ve seen a few in the early stages, but most of the people who come into treatment have had it for a very long time.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "How aware, would you say, are typical patients that they have hoarding disorder when you first see them?\n",
      "Interviewee: Well, because they’re in my clinic or in my research study, pretty aware.\n",
      "Interviewer: Pretty aware.\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah.\n",
      "They’re coming, for the most part, on their own accord.\n",
      "They may not know the term, but they know the problem.\n",
      "Interviewer: So, next I’m going to ask you, how do you explain hoarding disorder to a patient with low insight?\n",
      "Interviewee: I think that has changed over the years as my understanding of it has changed, but I explain that things are valuable to them, that even though they’re valuable there is some risk in keeping as many things as they have.\n",
      "There’s safety issues, there’s health issues.\n",
      "That we are not asking to get rid of all of their things, but just to make their home safe and livable.\n",
      "It’s kind of a harm reduction model.\n",
      "I don’t try to get into what’s causing it.\n",
      "I don’t try to get into even explaining what it is as a psychiatric illness, because if they have low insight that tends to raise defensiveness and decrease cooperation.\n",
      "My goal is quality of life, so if they have very low insight the issue is improving their living circumstances and not getting rid of their stuff.\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok.\n",
      "Interviewee: And that’s changed over the years as I’ve kind of worked with folks more and more.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like it started maybe during your childhood when no one was teaching you how to properly organized and then it got worse as you got married to someone who was really into collecting.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Yes, true.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How severe would you say your behavior is now?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Do I need to rate it somehow?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "No, like do you think it's a real big problem for you or is it something like I might need to work on it, but you don't feel like this immense pressure to change.\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "There's a lot of pressure to change.\n",
      "It's so time consuming that it's like the biggest problem ever sometimes.\n",
      "You're spending time on something that you could do something else.\n",
      "My daughter will say, \"Why are you doing all this, because actually you need to do this.\"\n",
      "Yeah, it's the central matter that has to be solved, yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like you have sought to change your behavior.\n",
      "Have you ever sought professional help with someone?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Let me think.\n",
      "No, I mean I did a little bit of temporary group counseling which was going to lead to personal, individual counseling, and then I asked a couple counselors of churches, but you're talking maybe three years ago.\n",
      "I did a little phone counseling.\n",
      "Other than that, not steady.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "This counseling was to address the specific problem of collecting, right?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "I'm trying to remember.\n",
      "Three years ago it was for my emotional state and my state of mind probably, but I would have got to that if the guy would have asked me to have half an hour phone sessions, I think that would happen.\n",
      "Yeah, I kind of went through some [inaudible 00:13:40] living in my car and packing my stuff.\n",
      "I think what happened was I didn't feel secure enough, I had certain numbers of things with me and I still do that to this very day so yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "How do your family and friends feel about your behavior?\n",
      "Have you ever had conflicts with people close to you?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "It sounds like your daughters really want to you change.\n",
      "Are you feeling pressure from anyone else in your life maybe?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Yes, at times there is an element of pressure.\n",
      "Yes, that's true.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "From else would that be besides your daughters, would you be getting that pressure from?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Let me think.\n",
      "Probably one of my brothers, one of my cousins, the homeowner from I was renting a room, and now I'm getting a room.\n",
      "Each of my landlords so to speak.\n",
      "That's why I'm kind of on top of it sometimes, because of...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Because of like your landlords?\n",
      "Participant 042:\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Sometimes, I feel like, which is kind of bad, I must say that when people ask me what do I think about the COVID or about the pandemic, I've been asked enough times by people, say on the telephone that I'm starting to feel guilty.\n",
      "I feel like somehow or other I'm living apart from everybody else and that is the truth.\n",
      "I feel like I'm living in this bubble in this life that is very protective and all these other poor people are having to cope with it.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I'm not having to cope.\n",
      "A part of me feels kind of guilty.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Well, that's nice that you feel guilty, right?\n",
      "But I think that you can't control how you feel.\n",
      "It makes sense given everything, given you're less social, given you can work at your home and write.\n",
      "Makes sense that hasn't changed a lot.\n",
      "I have one more question, has it changed, is there more conflict between you and your partner with COVID or are you guys dealing with it pretty well?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Has it caused any tension or anything between you and your partner or have you guys been able to deal with it okay?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "We're dealing with it okay.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Oh, good.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So that's all that I have for you.\n",
      "I'm just going to get some quick demographic information and then some payment information so we can pay you for participating.\n",
      "Does that sound good?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "That sounds fine.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Cool.\n",
      "And thank you again for participating.\n",

      "What is the highest level of education you've attained?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "I didn't actually finish my PhD because the university kicked me out because I was taking too long, but I did everything but get the degree and finish the dissertation.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "So almost a PhD. Do you have a masters before that?\n",
      "Participant 039:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I do have a masters?\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "What is it in, I'm just curious.\n",

      "Interviewer: Oh so do one for kids and one for parents.\n",
      "Speaker: Right\n",
      "Interviewer: Ok\n",
      "Speaker: That’s not a bad idea.\n",
      "That’s a very good idea.\n",
      "Speaker: it’s because kids I think they would listen more if it was their personal story, you know, rather than oh moms there duh, they are like, I don’t know.\n",
      "I just feel like that would work.\n",
      "Interviewer: So in the parent video would that, who would be starring in the parent video?\n",
      "Would it be parents?\n",
      "Speaker: It would be their perspectives and what they’ve gone through and… what their involvements are going to be so they can speak with the parents you know.\n",
      "Interviewer: So other than the things we have on here um just curious on your thoughts um superheroes, do you think that’s something that kids would like to see in these types of videos?\n",
      "Speaker: I think the younger kids would I don’t know for the older the 16 year olds.\n",
      "I don’t know.\n",
      "I don’t have a 16 year old yet so I don’t know......\n",
      "They might think its cheesy…\n",
      "Speaker: Mines a 11, my sons 11 that’s in this and I mean he likes superheroes, but I don’t feel like that would a good way to try and relate with him imaging children older maybe not so much, but yeah, maybe younger.\n",
      "That I would say for that age group… I wouldn’t unless yeah, I wouldn’t\n",
      "Interviewer: How about um any other non-human characters like animals?\n",
      "Pets?\n",
      "Speaker: There’s always you know ways to make animals kind of cute or cool you know to target that audience whether it be a dinosaur or however you dissolve it [29:34]\n",
      "or interject it but….\n",
      "I don’t know.\n",
      "Speaker: I don’t know to me to think even you know my child would… I don’t know… I don’t think, it would lack seriousness somehow they would it wouldn’t be it wouldn’t hit… It wouldn’t be as personalized you know I thing, buts that I don’t know because I’m not a kid and I don’t know.\n",
      "I feel like they would relate more to other kids than superheroes or you know um pets.\n",
      "Speaker: I almost think of imagery as far as cartoons go like, I think of like taking you know cartoon brains and cartoon hearts while they are showing the kids sitting there you know, like maybe they will do it an outline of the brain or something and then show something sweet happening to it or maybe show something difficult happening to it and then something sweet happening to it, like maybe it’s up against a brick you know in a hard place or a rock in a hard place you know, and then maybe show in time we are gonna show you how to and the brick turns to sand you know [30:51]___.\n",
      "I think of things also, I think of things that show like ways to heal the heart because they feel, these kids feel so much and they don’t want to be like this, you know.\n",
      "So I think more as far as cartoon imagery is going that’s like the first thing that popped in my mind more than animals or superheroes.\n",
      "Interviewer: Right\n",
      "Speaker: I mean you can incorporate that if you want, but I think they can see oh wow like that brain is having a hard time, my brain has a hard time you know.\n",
      "Once they go through this oh look it’s happening to the brain, you know what I mean they’re [31:20] __ I think that would touch them more.\n",
      "31: 23 Interviewer: Right so going into that we actually have um three categories of um options that we are playing with right now in terms of the style choices.\n",
      "So we have this line art which is basically kind of those types of videos where you’d have those illustrations that can be happening during the video basically and being able to draw things out so that first [31:42] ___.\n",
      "Speaker: I kind of like that\n",
      "P2: That’s part of what we've been wondering if it is a doctor thing is it a you know perhaps the background in OCD or if you are background in social work or I don’t know but it will be very interesting to look I think at at the end to see why that is\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm\n",
      "P1: Yeah\n",
      "Interviewee: So sorry to interrupt NAME (1:11:12)\n",
      "P1: No um yeah um so the next criteria we wanted to bring up and kind of discuss with you is uh the this is kind of something we had talked about the discarding of possessions they have and accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas thereby compromising their intended use um so\n",
      "P2: You know\n",
      "P1: Yeah go ahead NAME (1:11:40)\n",
      "P2: No uh we were going to ask you exactly what you had answered us already\n",
      "Interviewee: Okay\n",
      "P2: Determination as to how much stuff is is too much depending on things like house size um you know a lot of factors with that but we also wanted to ask since we kind of already talked about it I'm just going to loop by that question if it's okay um but we also wanted to ask about the idea of um substantially compromised use um and how you view as a clinician what the patients intent for the space might be um I don’t know if that make sense as a question you know like uh the example that we give is if a person doesn’t cook what is the the intended use of their kitchen and what’s a normal intended use\n",
      "Interviewee: Mhm right yeah yeah no like uh the little lady who’s awesome she ninety-two she’s done all of our studies she still wicked smart she love to entertain she's got this group of lady friends that she likes to have over and they play bridge she gets all of her meals delivered she does not need her kitchen because of her you know physically she’s she’s rather compromised just because of her age so she'd rather and she doesn’t really sleep in a bed anymore she sleep in a one of those lazy boy recliners because it helps her get up um so you know her bedroom is just a storage facility that’s what it is her kitchen is just another closet she doesn't need it for anything uh she has access to the sink and she has access the fridge which is really she has access to her microwave and that what really all she needs um so do we give her that criterion or not?\n",
      "I do because like there’s a lot of layers to the onion um she can’t find some document that are fairly important to her if a fire were to break out in one of those back room she’d be toast if there was some other problem that would happen in the like cave that is the rest of the house you’d never know and it could be pretty serious um she had like a rat get in right and like for that poor exterminator guy trying to find like where that rat is living like is a serious issue (laughing) so yeah it's really subjective I think\n",
      "P2: Okay\n",
      "P1: And there are other things that kind of have to come into that judgment\n",
      "Interviewee: Yeah\n",
      "So I needed time to do it after my event and I would use to take, in the afternoon, it was a pleasant afternoon's task to do that and I [inaudible 00:18:43] my hose clamps lined up just right and just went about the preventative maintenance.\n",
      "I'm a great believer of planned maintenance and that's from professional experience but the ...So I went to bite this off and it took me three days to get it done, at the end of three days I did not have things quite right.\n",
      "My scars were all peeled up and bloody from the mishaps, and I knew [inaudible 00:19:09] even though I knew how I wanted my hand to move, my brain wouldn't make it do it.\n",
      "It was [inaudible 00:19:09], okay.\n",
      "That's what made me decide that I couldn't use my hand tools anymore.\n",

      "So you really felt-\n",

      "[crosstalk 00:19:24].\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "You really felt limited by that.\n",
      "So you felt better about giving up your space because you recognized how limited you were.\n",
      "What is your space like now?\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:19:33].\n",

      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "I'm sorry, it's a heartbreak for me and still I try to be a realest.\n",
      "So it's a [inaudible 00:19:43], it's a reality, too bad.\n",
      "I'm straying from your question.\n",
      "I did show up.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No, I understand.\n",
      "That is a really difficult thing to face and it sounds like you just had to accept it.\n",
      "I understand that that would be really a difficult thing to accept.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "For somebody-\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "The older you get, the easiest it is things that are to accept I think.\n",
      "If it happened to me when I was 18 or 20, I'm going to have a much harder time than when it did.\n",
      "It was tough enough [inaudible 00:20:08].\n",
      "It would've been worse if I were younger.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yeah, my dad always used to say, \"Aging is not for sissies.\"\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "There's some truth in that.\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "And that's a [inaudible 00:20:21] when my wife had passed on or we had done our genetic duty, you might say if there's such a thing.\n",
      "A societal and genetically reproduced , we've raised successful children, they were a literate and [inaudible 00:20:32] structure, that was a happy day.\n",
      "I told [inaudible 00:20:32], \"We've done our work here, Jim.\"\n",
      "So that was pretty much coasting, but yes you might say that's not quite the right term for it but ...\n",
      "Interviewer:\n",
      "Made it easier for you to accept that you felt like you'd had a very good and productive life.\n",
      "Participant 036:\n",
      "Yes, and demonstrated through my children and that's mostly because of my wife's genetics.\n"
