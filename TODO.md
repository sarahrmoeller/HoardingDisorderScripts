# TODO
Create a “clean” version of set 1, 2 and 3. Once cleaned, rename folders and files of “noisy” sets to keep separate.
- [ ] Important:
  - [x] Create Logistic Model
  - [x] Abstract `generate_table.py` code into `Document` class
  - [x] Fix broken transcripts found in `broken_transcripts.ipynb`
    - [x] 2010
    - [x] 012
    - [x] 001-007
  - [x] Separate document content into interviewer and participant
    - [x] Figure out what to do with three-speaker documents (we are doing Frankenstein to solve this)
    - [x] ~~Frankenstein Document content together to analyze data by Transcript~~ Create `Transcript` class
    - [x] Create new table based on transcript data
    - [x] Identify certain lines that don't need speaker labels, i.e. transcript labels, [END OF RECORDING], and PART 2 OF 4 ENDS [00:46:04] (look through removable tokens), see `identifying_removable_tokens.ipynb`
- Datasaur Exports
  - [ ] Rename files: Add 1 to the beginning of every file name in set 1 (So set 1 files begins with 1, set 2 with 2, set 3 with 3)
  - [ ] Remove from every document transcriber notes that don’t stand in for words: time stamps, [laughter], etc.
  - [ ] Make sure anonymization and other transcriber notes that need to be kept because they substitute words are marked with identical format for same types of things, e.g. [ANONYMIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [NAME], [INAUDIBLE]. Format exactly the same in every document the anonymization and unclear comments in square brackets and capital letters. Same as old note "Normalize certain tokens, i.e. LOCATION == CITY, STATE, ETC" 
  - [ ] Interview 2008 has no punctuation (periods, commas). Punctuation must be added by hand.
  - [x] Eyeball other interviews for lack of punctuation
  - [ ] Make speaker labels homogeneous: all interviewers and interviewees notated the same when in "{Speaker Label}:" format.
    - [x] Identify removable tokens in documents (see `identifying_removable_tokens.ipynb`)
    - [x] Figure out how to remove each removable token
    - [x] Edit `Document` class to include a cleaned version
    - [x] Test Document cleaning on specific Documents
- Text files
  - [x] Rename files: Add 1 to the beginning of every file name in set 1 (So set 1 files begins with 1, set 2 with 2, set 3 with 3)

    - [x] Test Document cleaning on specific Documents
  - [ ] Implement metrics from previous paper using cleaned text files
Later:
  - [x] Figure out what to do about speakers that are not at the beginning of the line
  - [ ] Report model accuracy
  - [ ] Find way to automatically label incomplete clauses
